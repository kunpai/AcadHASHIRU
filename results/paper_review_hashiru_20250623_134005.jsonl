GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: kNN-Diffusion: Image Generation via Large-Scale Retrieval\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Large-scale generative models have been applied successfully to image generation tasks (Gafni et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2021; Nichol et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022), and have shown outstanding capabilities in extending human creativity using editing and user control. However, these models face several significant challenges: (i) Large-scale paired data requirement. To achieve high-quality results, text-to-image models rely heavily on large-scale datasets of (text, image) pairs collected from the internet. Due to the requirement of paired data, these models cannot be applied to new or customized domains with only unannotated images. (ii) Computational cost and efficiency. Training these models on highly complex distributions of natural images usually requires scaling the size of the model, data, batch-size, and training time, which makes them challenging to train and less accessible to the community. Recently, several works proposed text-to-image models trained without paired text-image datasets. Liu et al. (2021) performed a direct optimization to a pretrained model based on a CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021). Such approaches are time-consuming, since they require optimization for each input. Zhou et al. (2021) proposed training with CLIP image embedding perturbed with Gaussian noise. However, to achieve high-quality results, an additional model needs to be trained with an annotated text-image pairs dataset. In this work, we introduce a novel generative model, kNN-Diffusion, which tackles these issues and progresses towards more accessible models for the research community and other users. Our model leverages a large-scale retrieval method, k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) search, in order to train the model without any text data. Specifically, our diffusion model is conditioned on two inputs: (1) image embedding (at training time) or text embedding (at inference), extracted using the multimodal CLIP encoder, and (2) kNN embeddings, representing the k most similar images in the CLIP latent space. During training, we assume that no paired text is available, hence condition only on CLIP image embedding and on k additional image embeddings, selected using the retrieval model. At inference, only text inputs are given, so instead of image embeddings, we use the text embedding that shares a joint embedding space with the image embeddings. Here, the kNN image embeddings are retrieved using the text embeddings. The additional kNN image embeddings have three main benefits: (1) they extend the distribution of conditioning embeddings and ensure the distribution is similar in train and inference, thus helping to bridge the gap between the image and text embedding distributions; (2) they teach the model to learn to generate images from a target distribution by using samples from that distribution. This capability allows generalizing to different distributions at test time and generating out-of-distribution samples; (3) they hold information that does not need to be present in the model, which allows it to be substantially smaller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our kNN approach in Sec. 4. To assess the performance of our method, we train our model on two large-scale datasets: the Public Multimodal Dataset (Singh et al., 2021) and an image-only stickers dataset collected from the Internet. We show state-of-the-art zero-shot capabilities on MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014), LNCOCO (Pont-Tuset et al., 2020) and CUB (Wah et al., 2011). To further demonstrate the advantage of using retrieval methods in text-to-image generation, we train two diffusion backbones using our kNN approach: continuous (Ramesh et al., 2022) and discrete (Gu et al., 2021). In both cases we outperform the model that is trained without kNN. In comparison to alternative methods presented in Sec. 4, we achieve state-of-the-art results in both human evaluations and FID score, with 400 million parameters and 7 second inference time. Lastly, we introduce a new approach for local and semantic manipulations that is based on CLIP and kNN, without relying on user-provided masks. Specifically, we fine-tune our model to perform local and complex modifications that satisfies a given target text prompt. For example, given the teddy bear\u2019s image in Fig. 4, and the target text \"holds a heart\", our method automatically locates the local region that should be modified and synthesizes a high-resolution manipulated image in which (1) the teddy bear\u2019s identity is accurately preserved and (2) the manipulation is aligned with the target text. We demonstrate our qualitative advantage by comparing our results with two state-of-the-art models, Text2Live (Bar-Tal et al., 2022) and Textual Inversion (Gal et al., 2022), that perform image manipulations without masks (Fig. 4, 19 and 20). We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: (1) We propose kNN-Diffusion, a novel and efficient model that utilizes a large-scale retrieval method for training a text-to-image model without using text. (2) We demonstrate efficient out-of-distribution generation, which is achieved by substituting retrieval databases. (3) We present a new approach for local and semantic image manipulation, without utilizing masks. (4) We evaluate our method on two diffusion backbones, discrete and continuous, as well as on several datasets, and present state-of-the-art results compared to baselines trained using image-only datasets. 2 RELATED WORK: Text-to-image models. Text-to-image generation is a well-studied task that focuses on generating images from text descriptions. While GANs (Xu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021) and VQ-VAE Transformer-based methods (Ramesh et al., 2021; Gafni et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2021) have shown remarkable results, recently impressive results have been attained with discrete (Gu et al., 2021) and continuous (Nichol et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022) diffusion models. Most recent works trained diffusion models conditioned on text embeddings extracted using a pre-trained text encoder (Saharia et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022) or image embedding extracted using CLIP (Ramesh et al., 2022). While producing impressive results, all previous works described above are supervised and trained with paired textimage datasets. Several works have proposed training text-to-image models without text data. FuseDream (Liu et al., 2021) proposed a direct optimization to a pre-trained generative model based on CLIP loss. This method relies on a pre-trained GAN and requires a time-consuming optimization process for each image. LAFITE (Zhou et al., 2021) recently demonstrated text-to-image generation results without requiring paired text-image datasets. Here, the embeddings of CLIP are used interchangeably at train and test time to condition a GAN-based model. The joint text-image embedding enables inference given a text input, whereas in training the model is fed with the visual embedding only. However, the gap between the text and image distributions in the joint embeddings space leads to results with substantially lower quality, as we show in our experiments. To overcome this gap, LAFITE added noise to the image embeddings during training. Our remedy to this gap in distributions is to condition the model on the retrieval of an actual image embeddings, using a text-image joint space. Retrieval for generation. The Information Retrieval (IR) literature tackles the challenge of retrieving a small amount of information from a large database, given a user\u2019s query. While it has been shown that adding more training data improves performance, this comes at a cost, as it requires collecting and training on more data. A simple, yet efficient retrieval mechanism is to retrieve the K nearest neighbors (kNN) between the query and the entities in the database in some pre-calculated embedding space (Bijalwan et al., 2014). The database allows the model to leverage extensive world-knowledge for its specific task Borgeaud et al. (2021). Recently, language models were augmented with a memory component, allowing them to store representations of past inputs (Wu et al., 2022). The latter were then queried using a lookup operation, improving performance in various benchmarks and tasks. Retrieval models have been used for various tasks in learning problems, for example, language modeling (Borgeaud et al., 2021), machine translation (Gu et al., 2018), question answering (Lee et al., 2019) and image generation (Tseng et al., 2020). RetrieveGAN (Tseng et al., 2020) uses a differentiable retrieval module for image generation from a scene description, RetrievalFuse (Siddiqui et al., 2021) proposed a neural 3D scene reconstruction based on a retrieval system. In this work we utilize the kNN retrieval mechanism over the shared text-image embedding space, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). Using extensive ablation studies, we show the importance of the retrieval model both for training and inference, and demonstrate its large impact on performance. Multi-modal feature learning. Learning a joint and aligned feature space for several modalities is challenging, as it requires alignment between the modalities (paired datasets), whose distributions may vary. Specifically, the joint feature space of vision-and-language has been a long-standing problem in artificial intelligence. CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) is a method that successfully tackled this challenge, by leveraging contrastive learning over a large dataset of aligned text-image pairs. Several works, such as BLIP (Li et al., 2022), (Mu et al., 2021) and FLAVA (Singh et al., 2021), followed this idea and further improved the joint representation. The joint representation was shown to hold a strong semantic alignment between the two modalities, enabling image generation (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), image manipulation (Patashnik et al., 2021; Avrahami et al., 2022b), and image captioning (Mokady et al., 2021). In this work we leverage the joint representation in two ways: (i) enabling textless training with only visual data, while using text at inference time, and (ii) creating an efficient embedding space for the use of the retrieval model. 3 METHOD: Our main goal is to facilitate language-guided generation of user-specified concepts while using an images-only dataset (without paired text data) during training. A possible way to achieve this goal is to use a shared text-image encoder that will map text-image pairs into the same latent space, thus allowing training with an image embedding, and inferring from text embedding. A candidate for this encoder is CLIP, which has been trained with a contrastive loss on a large-scale dataset of textimage pairs. However, as we show quantitatively in Tab. 1, 2 and qualitatively in Fig. 5, 13, CLIP embeddings alone cannot accurately bridge the gap between the text and image distributions. In order to reduce this gap, several methods have been proposed. The closest work to ours is LAFITE, which perturbs the CLIP image embedding with adaptive Gaussian noise. As a result, the model is expected to be more robust to differences in the distributions. Under the assumption that there is a large paired text-image dataset, Ramesh et al. (2022) have proposed a prior that is used during inference, and is trained to generate possible CLIP image embeddings from a given text caption. In this regard, we propose using a large-scale and non-trainable image embedding index as an integral part of the diffusion process. Our proposed method, kNN-Diffusion, assumes that only image data is provided during training. As shown in Fig. 3, our model is comprised of three main components: (1) A multi-modal text-image encoder (CLIP); (2) A retrieval model - A data structure containing image embeddings, which is indexed for a fast kNN search; (3) An image generation network - A trainable diffusion-based image generation model, conditioned on the projected retrievals. For both training and inference, the image generation network is conditioned on K additional image embeddings, chosen using the retrieval model to ensure a similar distribution of the condition in training and inference. The following sections describe these components, and additional details can be found in Sec. 6.6 and 6.5 in the supplement. Retrieval model. Our retrieval model has three non-trainable modules: a pre-trained text encoder ftxt, a pre-trained image encoder fimg and an index H. The encoders map text descriptions and image samples to a joint multi-modal d-dimensional feature space Rd. The index stores an efficient representation of the images database -H := {fimg(i) \u2208 Rd|i \u2208 I} where I denotes the dataset of images. During training, we use the index to efficiently extract the k nearest neighbors in the feature space of the image embedding fimg(I) \u2208 Rd - knnimg(I, k) := argminkh\u2208H s(fimg(I), h) where s is a distance function and argmink output the minimal k elements. The set {fimg(I), knnimg(I, k)} is used as the condition to the generative model. During inference, given a query text t, an embedding ftxt(t) is extracted. The generative model is conditioned on this embedding and its k nearest neighbors from the database - knntxt(t, k) := argminkh\u2208H s(ftxt(t), h). During training, we add embeddings of real images, by applying the retrieval method to the input image embedding. The extracted kNN should have a large enough distribution to cover the potential text embedding. During inference, the kNN are retrieved using the text embedding (See Fig. 10). In all of our experiments we use CLIP as the encoders ftxt and fimg , and the cosine similarity metric as the distance function s. Implementation details can be found in Sec.6.4 of the supplement. Image generation network. In order to demonstrate the robustness of our method, we apply our kNN approach on two different diffusion backbones: Discrete (Gu et al., 2021) and Continuous (Nichol et al., 2021; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). Although very different in practice, these models share the same theoretical idea. Let x0 \u223c q(x0) be a sample from our images distribution. A forward process of a diffusion model q(xn|xn\u22121) is a Markov chain that adds noise at each step. The reverse process, p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, x0), is a denoising process that removes noise from an initialized noise state. At inference time, the model can generate an output, starting with noise and gradually removing it using p\u03b8. In the discrete diffusion model, q(xn|xn\u22121) := vT (xn)Qnv(xn\u22121) and p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y) :=\u2211k x\u03020=1 q(xn\u22121|xn, x\u03020)p\u03b8(x\u03020|xn, x0, y), where v(xn) is a one-hot vector with entry 1 at xn, and Qn is a transition matrix, modeling the probability to move from state xn\u22121 to xn, using uniform probability over the vocabulary and a pre-defined probability for additional special [MASK] token. x0 is a discrete vector, tokenized by the VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021) encoder. For modeling p\u03b8 we have followed (Gu et al., 2021) and used a conditional Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). In the continuous diffusion model, q(xn|xn\u22121) := N (xn; \u221a \u03b1txn\u22121, (1 \u2212 \u03b1n)x0) and p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn) := N (\u00b5\u03b8(xn),\u03a3\u03b8(xn)). Here, the noise function is Gaussian noise. For modeling p\u03b8 we have followed (Ramesh et al., 2022) and used a U-net architecture. We sample both our models using Classifier Free Guidance (CFG) (Nichol et al., 2021; Ho & Salimans, 2021). Since CFG was originally proposed for continuous models, we propose a method for using it with discrete models as well. The full details can be found in Sec. 6.5 of the supplement. 3.1 TEXT-ONLY IMAGE MANIPULATION: The majority of previous works in the task of image manipulation either rely on user-provided masks (Nichol et al., 2021; Avrahami et al., 2022b;a), or are limited to global editing (Crowson et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022). Recently, several works (Bar-Tal et al., 2022; Hertz et al., 2022; Gal et al., 2022) have made progress with local manipulations without relying on user edited masks. Nevertheless, most of the techniques suffer from several shortcomings: (1) They enable local texture changes, yet cannot modify complex structures, (2) they struggle to preserve the identity of the object, for example, when manipulating humans, (3) they require optimization for each input. We address these issues by extending kNN-Diffusion to perform local and semantic-aware image manipulations without any provided mask. Illustration of the approach is provided in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 in the supplement. For this task, the model is trained to predict the original image from a manipulated version. Specifically, we create a manipulated version of the image, which differs from the original image only in some local area. Given a random local area M in the image I, the manipulated image Imanip is constructed by replacing the area with the corresponding nearest neighbor: Imanip = I \u00b7 (1 \u2212M) + nnimg(I, 1) \u00b7M , where nnimg(I, 1) is the the nearest neighbor obtained after aligning it with I using the ECC alignment algorithm (Evangelidis & Psarakis, 2008). The model then receives as input the manipulated image, together with the CLIP embedding of the original image only in the local area: fimg(I \u00b7M). This CLIP embedding represents the required modification that should be applied to the manipulated image in order to predict the original image. During inference, instead of using the CLIP embedding of the local area, the desired modification is represented using the CLIP embedding of the user text query. We modified the model to be capable of receiving as a condition both the manipulated image and the CLIP embedding of the local area. 4 EXPERIMENTS: First, we conduct qualitative and quantitative comparisons on MS-COCO, LN-COCO and CUB datasets to compare with previous work. To further demonstrate the advantage of our method, we provide comparison on an image-only stickers dataset, where we apply our approach on two diffusion backbones. Next, we demonstrate image manipulation and out-of-distribution capabilities. Finally, to better assess the effect of each contribution, an ablation study is provided. Datasets and Metrics. For photo-realistic experiments, our model was trained only on the images (omitting the text) of a modified version of the Public Multimodal Dataset (PMD) used by FLAVA (Singh et al., 2021). More information about the dataset is available in Sec. 6.2 of the supplement. To further demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we collected 400 million sticker images from the web, containing combinations of concepts such as objects, characters/avatars and text. The collected stickers do not have paired text, and are substantially different from photorealistic data. Furthermore, since they have no paired text, they were not part of CLIP\u2019s training data, which makes the text-to-image generation task more challenging. Evaluation metrics are based on objective and subjective metrics: (i) FID (Heusel et al., 2017) is an objective metric used to assess the quality of synthesized images, (ii) human evaluation - we ask human raters for their preference, comparing two methods based on image quality and text alignment. We used 600 image pairs; five raters rated each pair. The results are shown as a percentage of majority votes in favor of our method over the baselines. We report the full human evaluation protocol in the supplement. We chose to omit Inception-Score, since it is shown by Barratt & Sharma (2018) to be a misleading metric for models that were not trained on Imagenet. 4.1 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESULTS: We begin by comparing our model, trained on the PMD dataset, with the previous works LAFITE and FuseDream, that trained on image-only datasets. To demonstrate the advantage of using a retrieval method in text-to-image generation, we trained a model variant, no-kNN . This baseline was trained solely on image embeddings (omitting the kNN), while during inference, the images were generated using the text embedding. Tab. 1 displays zero-shot results on three different datasets: MSCOCO, CUB and LN-COCO. We follow the evaluation protocol of LAFITE, reporting our results on MS-COCO without training, nor using it\u2019s training partition in the kNN index. Similarly, we follow LAFITE for CUB and LN-COCO evaluation. As can be seen, our model achieves the lowest FID score in all scenarios. In addition, human evaluations rate our method as better aligned to text and with the highest images quality. In Fig. 2, 5 and 15 we present a qualitative comparison between the methods. One can observe that while the simple retrieval baseline outputs non-generated images with high-quality, the images generated by our method are more faithful to the input text. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we present in Fig. 6 a comparison of our model with the latest text-to-image models trained on paired text-image datasets: DALL\u00b7E, CogView, VQ-Diffusion, GLIDE, Latent Diffusion(LDM), Make-A-Scene, DALL\u00b7E2, Parti and Imagen. As can be seen, our model achieves comparable results to recent models trained with full text-image pairs (e.g LDM, GLIDE), despite being trained on an image-only dataset, with significantly lower computational costs. The results demonstrate that leveraging an external retrieval database allows our method to compensate for different trade-offs, in particular, reducing the number of parameters in the model. Additional samples are provided in Fig. 14 in the supplement. Text-to-sticker generation. As the sticker dataset does not have paired text, and is substantially different from photo-realistic data, it allows us to illustrate the advantage of our model on an imageonly dataset. A selection of stickers generated by our model is presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 17, 16. To demonstrate the importance of using kNN on image-only datasets, we evaluate our approach on two diffusion backbones. To this end, we trained a continuous diffusion model (Ramesh et al., 2022) and a discrete diffusion model (Gu et al., 2021), both conditioned on the kNN image embeddings. For each backbone, we compare our method with the following baselines: (1) no-kNN - this baseline was trained using both the continuous and the discrete methods conditioned only on image CLIP embedding, without using kNN. In the discrete case, we trained a VQ-diffusion model, while in the continuous case, we trained a re-implementation of DALL\u00b7E2\u2019s decoder (without prior). (2) DALL\u00b7E2+ClipCap baseline - here, we first captioned the entire sticker dataset using ClipCap (Mokady et al., 2021), then trained DALL\u00b7E2 decoder on the captioned dataset. (3) LAFITE - we trained LAFITE language-free model on our stickers dataset using the authors\u2019 published code. We present the results in Tab. 2. The FID is calculated over a subset of 3, 000 stickers, generated from the ClipCap captioned dataset. As can be seen, our model achieves the lowest FID score. In addition, it outperforms all baselines in human evaluation comparison, using both continuous and discrete backbones. In particular, compared with the same model trained without kNN, our model achieves significantly higher favorability in both text alignment and image quality. 4.2 APPLICATIONS: Text-only image manipulation. We demonstrate the manipulation capabilities of our model in Fig. 1, 4 and 18. Furthermore, we qualitatively compare our model with Text2LIVE (Bar-Tal et al., 2022) and Textual Inversion (Gal et al., 2022), using the authors\u2019 published code. Text2LIVE proposed generating an edit layer that is composed over the original input, using a generator trained for each training image. Textual Inversion utilized the pre-trained Latent Diffusion model to invert the input image into a token embedding. The embedding is then used to compose novel textual queries for the generative model. Fig. 4 shows representative results, and the rest are included in Fig. 19 and 20 in the supplement. In contrast to our model, baseline methods lack text correspondence or they do not preserve the identity of the object. Since Text2LIVE is optimized to perform local changes, it has the difficulty changing the structure of the object (e.g. the \"raising his hand\" example in Fig. 4). Textual Inversion baseline changes the identity of the object because it struggles reconstructing the textual representation of the source image. Our model, on the other hand, can perform challenging manipulations that are aligned with the text, while preserving the object identity. Out-of-distribution generation. Using the retrieval index as part of the generation process enables using different databases during inference, without fine-tuning. This allows the model to generate images from distributions that were not part of the training set, enabling out-of-distribution generation. This novel capability is demonstrated with the same model trained on PMD, using three different retrieval databases: (i) A stickers database presented in Sec. 4. (ii) Aesthetic database: This database is constructed by filtering images according to a classifier score. Let C be a classifier that for each image i \u2208 I outputs a score s = C(i). This classifier enables filtering the kNN using L \u2264 s < H , where L and H are low and high thresholds, respectively. We demonstrate this capability using an open source pre-trained aesthet- ics classifier A (Christoph Schuhmann, 2022): For each text input t \u2208 T , we apply A on the kNN, and then divide the kNN into five equal quantiles based on A score. As can be seen in Fig. 7, using kNN with higher aesthetics score result in generated images with higher aesthetics mean score. (iii) Image search engine: Generative models are stationary in the sense that they are unable to learn new concepts after being trained, hence fine-tuning is required to represent new styles and concepts. Here, we use an online image search engine, which allows the model to adapt to new data without additional fine-tuning. A qualitative comparison of all three methods is shown in Fig.8. 4.3 ABLATION STUDY We conclude our experiments with an ablation study, to quantify the contribution of our different components. The experiments are performed on the PMD dataset, and FID scores are reported on the MS-COCO dataset. Ablation analysis on index size and different kNN conditioning approaches are provided in Sec. 6.3 in the supplement. Number of nearest neighbors. The results in Fig. 9 demonstrate the importance of applying the retrieval mechanism during training and inference. Here, we evaluate our kNN-Diffusion model, trained on PMD dataset, with different numbers of kNN during inference - 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, 1000. Furthermore, we examined the baseline no-kNN, in which during inference, the model is conditioned only on the text input embedding ftxt(t), without using kNN. As can be seen, best performance is achieved using 10 neighbors. 5 CONCLUSION: \u201cWe shall always find, that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar impression\", Hume (1748). In this paper, we propose using a large-scale retrieval method in order to train a novel text-to-image model, without any text data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that using an external knowledge-base alleviates much of the model\u2019s burden of learning novel concepts, enabling the use of a relatively small model. In addition, it provides the model the capability of learning to adapt to new samples, which it only observes during test time. Lastly, we present a new technique utilizing the retrieval method for text-driven semantic manipulations without user-provided masks. As evaluated by human studies and automatic metrics, our method is significantly preferable to the baselines in terms of image quality and text alignment. 6 APPENDIX:  6.1 HUMAN EVALUATION PROTOCOL: For all of our human evaluation experiments, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each experiment, we used 600 samples, each scored by five different people. The preferred sample was determined according to majority opinion. For each baseline comparison, we asked two questions (in different experiments): \"Which image is of a higher quality?\" and \"Which image best matches the text?\". 6.2 DATASETS: The modified PMD dataset is composed of the following set of publicly available text-image datasets: SBU Captions (Ordonez et al., 2011), Localized Narratives (Pont-Tuset et al., 2020), Conceptual Captions (Sharma et al., 2018), Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016), Wikipedia Image Text (Srinivasan et al., 2021), Conceptual Captions 12M (Changpinyo et al., 2021), Red Caps (Desai et al., 2021), and a filtered version of YFCC100M (Thomee et al., 2015). In total, the dataset contains 69 million text-image pairs. 6.3 ABLATION STUDY: Index size As one can expect, increasing the index size at inference time improves performance. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we evaluated our model with an index containing 10%, 30%, 50% and 70% images of PMD dataset, and obtained FID scores of 13.92, 13.85, 13.72, and 13.65 respectively. kNN conditioning We examined several different approaches to kNN input conditioning: (i) forwarding the kNN embeddings and the single image embedding through a self-attention layer before feeding the contextualized K +1 embeddings to the model, (ii) feeding the model with one embedding, computed using cross-attention between the image embedding and the kNN embeddings, and, (iii) feeding the model with the image embedding concatenated with a learned linear projection of the kNN embeddings. These variants received FID scores of 18.3, 22.4, 34.1 respectively. 6.4 RETRIEVAL MODEL: The retrieval model is implemented using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019). FAISS is an efficient database, capable of storing billions of elements and finding their nearest neighbors in milliseconds. In the pre-process phase we store the image index and its corresponding CLIP image embedding. Then, during training we search for the nearest neighbors using the image index. The photo-realistic dataset contains 69M samples, and the sticker dataset contains 400M samples. For an efficient search during training and inference, we use an inverted file index. As in Babenko & Lempitsky (2014), we define Voronoi cells in the d-dimensional space (where d = 512 is the CLIP embedding dimensional space), s.t each database vector falls in one of the cells. When searching for an image I , the nearest neighbors are retrieved only from the cluster that I falls in, and from the 19 other neighboring clusters. In order to fit the index of our large-scale datasets on a 128GB RAM server, we compress the code size from 4d = 2048 to 256 using optimized product quantization (Ge et al., 2013; Jegou et al., 2010). 6.5 DISCRETE KNN MODEL: We provide additional implementation details for the discrete diffusion model. Vector Quantization For token quantization, we use VQ-VAE and adapt the publicly available VQGAN(Esser et al., 2021) model, trained on the OpenImages(Krasin et al., 2016) dataset. The encoder downsamples images to 32\u00d732 tokens and uses a codebook vocabulary with 2887 elements. Image Tokenization In our discrete generative model we model images as a sequence of discrete tokens. To this end, we utilize a vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) (Van Den Oord et al., 2017) as image tokenizer. VQ-VAE consists of three components: (i) an encoder, (ii) a learned codebook, and, (iii) a decoder. Given an image, the encoder extracts a latent representation. The codebook then maps each latent vector representation to its nearest vector in the codebook. Finally, the decoder reconstructs the image from the codebook representation. VQ-VAE is trained with the objectives of reconstruction and codebook learning. VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021) adds an adversarial loss term that tries to determine whether the generated image is fake or real. This added term was shown to improve reconstruction quality. Transformer We follow Gu et al. (2021) and train a decoder-only Transformer. The decoder module contains 24 transformer blocks, each containing full attention, cross-attention for the concatenated conditioner, and a feed-forward network. The timestamp n is injected using Adaptive Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016). The decoder contains 400 million parameters, which is merely a tenth of baseline models such as CogView, DALL\u00b7E, and GLIDE. We use the same architecture for both sticker and photo-realistic image generation. Classifier-free guidance We sample our diffusion models using classifier-free guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2021; Nichol et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022). CFG is performed by extrapolating an unconditional sample in the direction of a conditional sample. To support unconditional sampling, previous work had to fine-tune (Nichol et al., 2021) their models with 20% of the conditional features nullified. This enabled them to sample unconditional images from the model using the null condition, y\u2032 = \u2212\u2192 0 , the null vector. We found that we can generate unconditional samples from our model using null conditioning without fine-tuning it. We hypothesize that by conditioning the model on a null vector, the cross-attention component is also nullified, resulting in no contribution to the diffusion process. During inference, in each step of the diffusion process we generate two images: conditional image logits, p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y), conditioned on the desired multi-modal embedding y, and the unconditional image logits, p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y\u2032), conditioned on the null embedding. Then, the final image for a diffusion step n is sampled from p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y) =p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y\u2032)+ \u03bb(p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y)\u2212 p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y\u2032)) where \u03bb is a scale coefficient. In all of our experiments, we set \u03bb = 8, which was found to yield the highest FID scores on the validation set. Note that the above extrapolation occurs directly on the logits output by p\u03b8, in contrast to GLIDE (Nichol et al., 2021), which extrapolates the pixel values. Training Objective For completeness we are adding the training objective of the discrete model. The network is trained to minimize the variational lower bound (VLB): Lvlb = L0 + L1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ LN\u22121 + LN , L0 = \u2212 log p\u03b8(x0|x1,y), Ln\u22121 = q(xn\u22121|xn,x0)p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn,y), LN = q(xN |x0)p(xN ). (1) Where p(xN ) is the prior distribution of timestep N . In all of our experiments N = 1000. The full details can be found in Gu et al. (2021). Algorithms We provide the training algorithm 1 and the inference algorithm 2 for the discrete diffusion model.

Note that both CogView and VQ-Diffusion have been trained on an ImageText paired dataset, whereas our model was not trained on the COCO dataset, nor used it in the retrieval model. Sticker generation In Fig. 13 we present a visual comparison of our discrete model, trained on the stickers dataset with (1) the kNN extracted during inference, (2) the same model without using kNN in inference. As can be seen, the stickers generated by our model are better aligned to the corresponding text compared to the baselines. While the baselines fail with challenging prompts, our model produces high-quality images that align with the text, and composes multiple concepts correctly. 6.6 CONTINUOUS KNN MODEL: Decoder. We followed (Nichol et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Ramesh et al., 2022) and re-implemented a diffusion U-net model. Specifically, we modify the architecture described in (Ramesh et al., 2022) by allowing multiple CLIP embeddings as the condition to the model. Since we do not have a paired text-image dataset, we removed the text transformer, and thus the text embedding. Similarly to our discrete model, we trained two models (1) a no-kNN conditioned only on CLIP image embedding during training, (2) a kNN conditioned on CLIP image embedding and its kNN. Finally, we enable classifier-free guidance by randomly setting the CLIP embeddings to zero 10% of the time. As demonstrated in Tab. 2, we find that humans prefer our model over no-kNN 66.8% of the time for image quality and 69.4% of the time for text alignment. Super-Resolution. As the decoder generates images with 64 \u00d7 64 resolution, we up-sampled the images to 256\u00d7 256 using the open-source super resolution of (Nichol et al., 2021). To further upsample the images to 512\u00d7512 and 1024\u00d71024 we used the open-source super resolution provided by (Wang et al., 2021). Training Objectives For completeness we are addding the training objective of our continous model. Following Ho et al. (2020); Nichol et al. (2021) we are using mean-squared error loss to predict the noise: L := En\u223c[1,N ],x0\u223cq(x0),\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)[||\u03f5\u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xn, n, y)|| 2] where \u03f5\u03b8 is a U \u2212 net model and y is the condition for the model. In all of our experiments N = 1000. 6.7 TEXT-ONLY IMAGE MANIPULATION: Our approach is illustrated in Fig. 11. Additional manipulation examples are provided in Figs. 18. The full comparison with the baselines is provided in Fig. 19 and 20. We also provide in Fig. 12 several examples for the process of the manipulated images construction. 6.8 ADDITIONAL SAMPLES: Additional samples generated from challenging text inputs are provided in Figs.

The paper title is: kNN-Diffusion: Image Generation via Large-Scale Retrieval\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Large-scale generative models have been applied successfully to image generation tasks (Gafni et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2021; Nichol et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022), and have shown outstanding capabilities in extending human creativity using editing and user control. However, these models face several significant challenges: (i) Large-scale paired data requirement. To achieve high-quality results, text-to-image models rely heavily on large-scale datasets of (text, image) pairs collected from the internet. Due to the requirement of paired data, these models cannot be applied to new or customized domains with only unannotated images. (ii) Computational cost and efficiency. Training these models on highly complex distributions of natural images usually requires scaling the size of the model, data, batch-size, and training time, which makes them challenging to train and less accessible to the community. Recently, several works proposed text-to-image models trained without paired text-image datasets. Liu et al. (2021) performed a direct optimization to a pretrained model based on a CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021). Such approaches are time-consuming, since they require optimization for each input. Zhou et al. (2021) proposed training with CLIP image embedding perturbed with Gaussian noise. However, to achieve high-quality results, an additional model needs to be trained with an annotated text-image pairs dataset. In this work, we introduce a novel generative model, kNN-Diffusion, which tackles these issues and progresses towards more accessible models for the research community and other users. Our model leverages a large-scale retrieval method, k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) search, in order to train the model without any text data. Specifically, our diffusion model is conditioned on two inputs: (1) image embedding (at training time) or text embedding (at inference), extracted using the multimodal CLIP encoder, and (2) kNN embeddings, representing the k most similar images in the CLIP latent space. During training, we assume that no paired text is available, hence condition only on CLIP image embedding and on k additional image embeddings, selected using the retrieval model. At inference, only text inputs are given, so instead of image embeddings, we use the text embedding that shares a joint embedding space with the image embeddings. Here, the kNN image embeddings are retrieved using the text embeddings. The additional kNN image embeddings have three main benefits: (1) they extend the distribution of conditioning embeddings and ensure the distribution is similar in train and inference, thus helping to bridge the gap between the image and text embedding distributions; (2) they teach the model to learn to generate images from a target distribution by using samples from that distribution. This capability allows generalizing to different distributions at test time and generating out-of-distribution samples; (3) they hold information that does not need to be present in the model, which allows it to be substantially smaller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our kNN approach in Sec. 4. To assess the performance of our method, we train our model on two large-scale datasets: the Public Multimodal Dataset (Singh et al., 2021) and an image-only stickers dataset collected from the Internet. We show state-of-the-art zero-shot capabilities on MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014), LNCOCO (Pont-Tuset et al., 2020) and CUB (Wah et al., 2011). To further demonstrate the advantage of using retrieval methods in text-to-image generation, we train two diffusion backbones using our kNN approach: continuous (Ramesh et al., 2022) and discrete (Gu et al., 2021). In both cases we outperform the model that is trained without kNN. In comparison to alternative methods presented in Sec. 4, we achieve state-of-the-art results in both human evaluations and FID score, with 400 million parameters and 7 second inference time. Lastly, we introduce a new approach for local and semantic manipulations that is based on CLIP and kNN, without relying on user-provided masks. Specifically, we fine-tune our model to perform local and complex modifications that satisfies a given target text prompt. For example, given the teddy bear\u2019s image in Fig. 4, and the target text \"holds a heart\", our method automatically locates the local region that should be modified and synthesizes a high-resolution manipulated image in which (1) the teddy bear\u2019s identity is accurately preserved and (2) the manipulation is aligned with the target text. We demonstrate our qualitative advantage by comparing our results with two state-of-the-art models, Text2Live (Bar-Tal et al., 2022) and Textual Inversion (Gal et al., 2022), that perform image manipulations without masks (Fig. 4, 19 and 20). We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: (1) We propose kNN-Diffusion, a novel and efficient model that utilizes a large-scale retrieval method for training a text-to-image model without using text. (2) We demonstrate efficient out-of-distribution generation, which is achieved by substituting retrieval databases. (3) We present a new approach for local and semantic image manipulation, without utilizing masks. (4) We evaluate our method on two diffusion backbones, discrete and continuous, as well as on several datasets, and present state-of-the-art results compared to baselines trained using image-only datasets. 2 RELATED WORK: Text-to-image models. Text-to-image generation is a well-studied task that focuses on generating images from text descriptions. While GANs (Xu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021) and VQ-VAE Transformer-based methods (Ramesh et al., 2021; Gafni et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2021) have shown remarkable results, recently impressive results have been attained with discrete (Gu et al., 2021) and continuous (Nichol et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022) diffusion models. Most recent works trained diffusion models conditioned on text embeddings extracted using a pre-trained text encoder (Saharia et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022) or image embedding extracted using CLIP (Ramesh et al., 2022). While producing impressive results, all previous works described above are supervised and trained with paired textimage datasets. Several works have proposed training text-to-image models without text data. FuseDream (Liu et al., 2021) proposed a direct optimization to a pre-trained generative model based on CLIP loss. This method relies on a pre-trained GAN and requires a time-consuming optimization process for each image. LAFITE (Zhou et al., 2021) recently demonstrated text-to-image generation results without requiring paired text-image datasets. Here, the embeddings of CLIP are used interchangeably at train and test time to condition a GAN-based model. The joint text-image embedding enables inference given a text input, whereas in training the model is fed with the visual embedding only. However, the gap between the text and image distributions in the joint embeddings space leads to results with substantially lower quality, as we show in our experiments. To overcome this gap, LAFITE added noise to the image embeddings during training. Our remedy to this gap in distributions is to condition the model on the retrieval of an actual image embeddings, using a text-image joint space. Retrieval for generation. The Information Retrieval (IR) literature tackles the challenge of retrieving a small amount of information from a large database, given a user\u2019s query. While it has been shown that adding more training data improves performance, this comes at a cost, as it requires collecting and training on more data. A simple, yet efficient retrieval mechanism is to retrieve the K nearest neighbors (kNN) between the query and the entities in the database in some pre-calculated embedding space (Bijalwan et al., 2014). The database allows the model to leverage extensive world-knowledge for its specific task Borgeaud et al. (2021). Recently, language models were augmented with a memory component, allowing them to store representations of past inputs (Wu et al., 2022). The latter were then queried using a lookup operation, improving performance in various benchmarks and tasks. Retrieval models have been used for various tasks in learning problems, for example, language modeling (Borgeaud et al., 2021), machine translation (Gu et al., 2018), question answering (Lee et al., 2019) and image generation (Tseng et al., 2020). RetrieveGAN (Tseng et al., 2020) uses a differentiable retrieval module for image generation from a scene description, RetrievalFuse (Siddiqui et al., 2021) proposed a neural 3D scene reconstruction based on a retrieval system. In this work we utilize the kNN retrieval mechanism over the shared text-image embedding space, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). Using extensive ablation studies, we show the importance of the retrieval model both for training and inference, and demonstrate its large impact on performance. Multi-modal feature learning. Learning a joint and aligned feature space for several modalities is challenging, as it requires alignment between the modalities (paired datasets), whose distributions may vary. Specifically, the joint feature space of vision-and-language has been a long-standing problem in artificial intelligence. CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) is a method that successfully tackled this challenge, by leveraging contrastive learning over a large dataset of aligned text-image pairs. Several works, such as BLIP (Li et al., 2022), (Mu et al., 2021) and FLAVA (Singh et al., 2021), followed this idea and further improved the joint representation. The joint representation was shown to hold a strong semantic alignment between the two modalities, enabling image generation (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), image manipulation (Patashnik et al., 2021; Avrahami et al., 2022b), and image captioning (Mokady et al., 2021). In this work we leverage the joint representation in two ways: (i) enabling textless training with only visual data, while using text at inference time, and (ii) creating an efficient embedding space for the use of the retrieval model. 3 METHOD: Our main goal is to facilitate language-guided generation of user-specified concepts while using an images-only dataset (without paired text data) during training. A possible way to achieve this goal is to use a shared text-image encoder that will map text-image pairs into the same latent space, thus allowing training with an image embedding, and inferring from text embedding. A candidate for this encoder is CLIP, which has been trained with a contrastive loss on a large-scale dataset of textimage pairs. However, as we show quantitatively in Tab. 1, 2 and qualitatively in Fig. 5, 13, CLIP embeddings alone cannot accurately bridge the gap between the text and image distributions. In order to reduce this gap, several methods have been proposed. The closest work to ours is LAFITE, which perturbs the CLIP image embedding with adaptive Gaussian noise. As a result, the model is expected to be more robust to differences in the distributions. Under the assumption that there is a large paired text-image dataset, Ramesh et al. (2022) have proposed a prior that is used during inference, and is trained to generate possible CLIP image embeddings from a given text caption. In this regard, we propose using a large-scale and non-trainable image embedding index as an integral part of the diffusion process. Our proposed method, kNN-Diffusion, assumes that only image data is provided during training. As shown in Fig. 3, our model is comprised of three main components: (1) A multi-modal text-image encoder (CLIP); (2) A retrieval model - A data structure containing image embeddings, which is indexed for a fast kNN search; (3) An image generation network - A trainable diffusion-based image generation model, conditioned on the projected retrievals. For both training and inference, the image generation network is conditioned on K additional image embeddings, chosen using the retrieval model to ensure a similar distribution of the condition in training and inference. The following sections describe these components, and additional details can be found in Sec. 6.6 and 6.5 in the supplement. Retrieval model. Our retrieval model has three non-trainable modules: a pre-trained text encoder ftxt, a pre-trained image encoder fimg and an index H. The encoders map text descriptions and image samples to a joint multi-modal d-dimensional feature space Rd. The index stores an efficient representation of the images database -H := {fimg(i) \u2208 Rd|i \u2208 I} where I denotes the dataset of images. During training, we use the index to efficiently extract the k nearest neighbors in the feature space of the image embedding fimg(I) \u2208 Rd - knnimg(I, k) := argminkh\u2208H s(fimg(I), h) where s is a distance function and argmink output the minimal k elements. The set {fimg(I), knnimg(I, k)} is used as the condition to the generative model. During inference, given a query text t, an embedding ftxt(t) is extracted. The generative model is conditioned on this embedding and its k nearest neighbors from the database - knntxt(t, k) := argminkh\u2208H s(ftxt(t), h). During training, we add embeddings of real images, by applying the retrieval method to the input image embedding. The extracted kNN should have a large enough distribution to cover the potential text embedding. During inference, the kNN are retrieved using the text embedding (See Fig. 10). In all of our experiments we use CLIP as the encoders ftxt and fimg , and the cosine similarity metric as the distance function s. Implementation details can be found in Sec.6.4 of the supplement. Image generation network. In order to demonstrate the robustness of our method, we apply our kNN approach on two different diffusion backbones: Discrete (Gu et al., 2021) and Continuous (Nichol et al., 2021; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). Although very different in practice, these models share the same theoretical idea. Let x0 \u223c q(x0) be a sample from our images distribution. A forward process of a diffusion model q(xn|xn\u22121) is a Markov chain that adds noise at each step. The reverse process, p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, x0), is a denoising process that removes noise from an initialized noise state. At inference time, the model can generate an output, starting with noise and gradually removing it using p\u03b8. In the discrete diffusion model, q(xn|xn\u22121) := vT (xn)Qnv(xn\u22121) and p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y) :=\u2211k x\u03020=1 q(xn\u22121|xn, x\u03020)p\u03b8(x\u03020|xn, x0, y), where v(xn) is a one-hot vector with entry 1 at xn, and Qn is a transition matrix, modeling the probability to move from state xn\u22121 to xn, using uniform probability over the vocabulary and a pre-defined probability for additional special [MASK] token. x0 is a discrete vector, tokenized by the VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021) encoder. For modeling p\u03b8 we have followed (Gu et al., 2021) and used a conditional Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). In the continuous diffusion model, q(xn|xn\u22121) := N (xn; \u221a \u03b1txn\u22121, (1 \u2212 \u03b1n)x0) and p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn) := N (\u00b5\u03b8(xn),\u03a3\u03b8(xn)). Here, the noise function is Gaussian noise. For modeling p\u03b8 we have followed (Ramesh et al., 2022) and used a U-net architecture. We sample both our models using Classifier Free Guidance (CFG) (Nichol et al., 2021; Ho & Salimans, 2021). Since CFG was originally proposed for continuous models, we propose a method for using it with discrete models as well. The full details can be found in Sec. 6.5 of the supplement. 3.1 TEXT-ONLY IMAGE MANIPULATION: The majority of previous works in the task of image manipulation either rely on user-provided masks (Nichol et al., 2021; Avrahami et al., 2022b;a), or are limited to global editing (Crowson et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022). Recently, several works (Bar-Tal et al., 2022; Hertz et al., 2022; Gal et al., 2022) have made progress with local manipulations without relying on user edited masks. Nevertheless, most of the techniques suffer from several shortcomings: (1) They enable local texture changes, yet cannot modify complex structures, (2) they struggle to preserve the identity of the object, for example, when manipulating humans, (3) they require optimization for each input. We address these issues by extending kNN-Diffusion to perform local and semantic-aware image manipulations without any provided mask. Illustration of the approach is provided in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 in the supplement. For this task, the model is trained to predict the original image from a manipulated version. Specifically, we create a manipulated version of the image, which differs from the original image only in some local area. Given a random local area M in the image I, the manipulated image Imanip is constructed by replacing the area with the corresponding nearest neighbor: Imanip = I \u00b7 (1 \u2212M) + nnimg(I, 1) \u00b7M , where nnimg(I, 1) is the the nearest neighbor obtained after aligning it with I using the ECC alignment algorithm (Evangelidis & Psarakis, 2008). The model then receives as input the manipulated image, together with the CLIP embedding of the original image only in the local area: fimg(I \u00b7M). This CLIP embedding represents the required modification that should be applied to the manipulated image in order to predict the original image. During inference, instead of using the CLIP embedding of the local area, the desired modification is represented using the CLIP embedding of the user text query. We modified the model to be capable of receiving as a condition both the manipulated image and the CLIP embedding of the local area. 4 EXPERIMENTS: First, we conduct qualitative and quantitative comparisons on MS-COCO, LN-COCO and CUB datasets to compare with previous work. To further demonstrate the advantage of our method, we provide comparison on an image-only stickers dataset, where we apply our approach on two diffusion backbones. Next, we demonstrate image manipulation and out-of-distribution capabilities. Finally, to better assess the effect of each contribution, an ablation study is provided. Datasets and Metrics. For photo-realistic experiments, our model was trained only on the images (omitting the text) of a modified version of the Public Multimodal Dataset (PMD) used by FLAVA (Singh et al., 2021). More information about the dataset is available in Sec. 6.2 of the supplement. To further demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we collected 400 million sticker images from the web, containing combinations of concepts such as objects, characters/avatars and text. The collected stickers do not have paired text, and are substantially different from photorealistic data. Furthermore, since they have no paired text, they were not part of CLIP\u2019s training data, which makes the text-to-image generation task more challenging. Evaluation metrics are based on objective and subjective metrics: (i) FID (Heusel et al., 2017) is an objective metric used to assess the quality of synthesized images, (ii) human evaluation - we ask human raters for their preference, comparing two methods based on image quality and text alignment. We used 600 image pairs; five raters rated each pair. The results are shown as a percentage of majority votes in favor of our method over the baselines. We report the full human evaluation protocol in the supplement. We chose to omit Inception-Score, since it is shown by Barratt & Sharma (2018) to be a misleading metric for models that were not trained on Imagenet. 4.1 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESULTS: We begin by comparing our model, trained on the PMD dataset, with the previous works LAFITE and FuseDream, that trained on image-only datasets. To demonstrate the advantage of using a retrieval method in text-to-image generation, we trained a model variant, no-kNN . This baseline was trained solely on image embeddings (omitting the kNN), while during inference, the images were generated using the text embedding. Tab. 1 displays zero-shot results on three different datasets: MSCOCO, CUB and LN-COCO. We follow the evaluation protocol of LAFITE, reporting our results on MS-COCO without training, nor using it\u2019s training partition in the kNN index. Similarly, we follow LAFITE for CUB and LN-COCO evaluation. As can be seen, our model achieves the lowest FID score in all scenarios. In addition, human evaluations rate our method as better aligned to text and with the highest images quality. In Fig. 2, 5 and 15 we present a qualitative comparison between the methods. One can observe that while the simple retrieval baseline outputs non-generated images with high-quality, the images generated by our method are more faithful to the input text. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we present in Fig. 6 a comparison of our model with the latest text-to-image models trained on paired text-image datasets: DALL\u00b7E, CogView, VQ-Diffusion, GLIDE, Latent Diffusion(LDM), Make-A-Scene, DALL\u00b7E2, Parti and Imagen. As can be seen, our model achieves comparable results to recent models trained with full text-image pairs (e.g LDM, GLIDE), despite being trained on an image-only dataset, with significantly lower computational costs. The results demonstrate that leveraging an external retrieval database allows our method to compensate for different trade-offs, in particular, reducing the number of parameters in the model. Additional samples are provided in Fig. 14 in the supplement. Text-to-sticker generation. As the sticker dataset does not have paired text, and is substantially different from photo-realistic data, it allows us to illustrate the advantage of our model on an imageonly dataset. A selection of stickers generated by our model is presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 17, 16. To demonstrate the importance of using kNN on image-only datasets, we evaluate our approach on two diffusion backbones. To this end, we trained a continuous diffusion model (Ramesh et al., 2022) and a discrete diffusion model (Gu et al., 2021), both conditioned on the kNN image embeddings. For each backbone, we compare our method with the following baselines: (1) no-kNN - this baseline was trained using both the continuous and the discrete methods conditioned only on image CLIP embedding, without using kNN. In the discrete case, we trained a VQ-diffusion model, while in the continuous case, we trained a re-implementation of DALL\u00b7E2\u2019s decoder (without prior). (2) DALL\u00b7E2+ClipCap baseline - here, we first captioned the entire sticker dataset using ClipCap (Mokady et al., 2021), then trained DALL\u00b7E2 decoder on the captioned dataset. (3) LAFITE - we trained LAFITE language-free model on our stickers dataset using the authors\u2019 published code. We present the results in Tab. 2. The FID is calculated over a subset of 3, 000 stickers, generated from the ClipCap captioned dataset. As can be seen, our model achieves the lowest FID score. In addition, it outperforms all baselines in human evaluation comparison, using both continuous and discrete backbones. In particular, compared with the same model trained without kNN, our model achieves significantly higher favorability in both text alignment and image quality. 4.2 APPLICATIONS: Text-only image manipulation. We demonstrate the manipulation capabilities of our model in Fig. 1, 4 and 18. Furthermore, we qualitatively compare our model with Text2LIVE (Bar-Tal et al., 2022) and Textual Inversion (Gal et al., 2022), using the authors\u2019 published code. Text2LIVE proposed generating an edit layer that is composed over the original input, using a generator trained for each training image. Textual Inversion utilized the pre-trained Latent Diffusion model to invert the input image into a token embedding. The embedding is then used to compose novel textual queries for the generative model. Fig. 4 shows representative results, and the rest are included in Fig. 19 and 20 in the supplement. In contrast to our model, baseline methods lack text correspondence or they do not preserve the identity of the object. Since Text2LIVE is optimized to perform local changes, it has the difficulty changing the structure of the object (e.g. the \"raising his hand\" example in Fig. 4). Textual Inversion baseline changes the identity of the object because it struggles reconstructing the textual representation of the source image. Our model, on the other hand, can perform challenging manipulations that are aligned with the text, while preserving the object identity. Out-of-distribution generation. Using the retrieval index as part of the generation process enables using different databases during inference, without fine-tuning. This allows the model to generate images from distributions that were not part of the training set, enabling out-of-distribution generation. This novel capability is demonstrated with the same model trained on PMD, using three different retrieval databases: (i) A stickers database presented in Sec. 4. (ii) Aesthetic database: This database is constructed by filtering images according to a classifier score. Let C be a classifier that for each image i \u2208 I outputs a score s = C(i). This classifier enables filtering the kNN using L \u2264 s < H , where L and H are low and high thresholds, respectively. We demonstrate this capability using an open source pre-trained aesthet- ics classifier A (Christoph Schuhmann, 2022): For each text input t \u2208 T , we apply A on the kNN, and then divide the kNN into five equal quantiles based on A score. As can be seen in Fig. 7, using kNN with higher aesthetics score result in generated images with higher aesthetics mean score. (iii) Image search engine: Generative models are stationary in the sense that they are unable to learn new concepts after being trained, hence fine-tuning is required to represent new styles and concepts. Here, we use an online image search engine, which allows the model to adapt to new data without additional fine-tuning. A qualitative comparison of all three methods is shown in Fig.8. 4.3 ABLATION STUDY We conclude our experiments with an ablation study, to quantify the contribution of our different components. The experiments are performed on the PMD dataset, and FID scores are reported on the MS-COCO dataset. Ablation analysis on index size and different kNN conditioning approaches are provided in Sec. 6.3 in the supplement. Number of nearest neighbors. The results in Fig. 9 demonstrate the importance of applying the retrieval mechanism during training and inference. Here, we evaluate our kNN-Diffusion model, trained on PMD dataset, with different numbers of kNN during inference - 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, 1000. Furthermore, we examined the baseline no-kNN, in which during inference, the model is conditioned only on the text input embedding ftxt(t), without using kNN. As can be seen, best performance is achieved using 10 neighbors. 5 CONCLUSION: \u201cWe shall always find, that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar impression\", Hume (1748). In this paper, we propose using a large-scale retrieval method in order to train a novel text-to-image model, without any text data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that using an external knowledge-base alleviates much of the model\u2019s burden of learning novel concepts, enabling the use of a relatively small model. In addition, it provides the model the capability of learning to adapt to new samples, which it only observes during test time. Lastly, we present a new technique utilizing the retrieval method for text-driven semantic manipulations without user-provided masks. As evaluated by human studies and automatic metrics, our method is significantly preferable to the baselines in terms of image quality and text alignment. 6 APPENDIX:  6.1 HUMAN EVALUATION PROTOCOL: For all of our human evaluation experiments, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each experiment, we used 600 samples, each scored by five different people. The preferred sample was determined according to majority opinion. For each baseline comparison, we asked two questions (in different experiments): \"Which image is of a higher quality?\" and \"Which image best matches the text?\". 6.2 DATASETS: The modified PMD dataset is composed of the following set of publicly available text-image datasets: SBU Captions (Ordonez et al., 2011), Localized Narratives (Pont-Tuset et al., 2020), Conceptual Captions (Sharma et al., 2018), Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016), Wikipedia Image Text (Srinivasan et al., 2021), Conceptual Captions 12M (Changpinyo et al., 2021), Red Caps (Desai et al., 2021), and a filtered version of YFCC100M (Thomee et al., 2015). In total, the dataset contains 69 million text-image pairs. 6.3 ABLATION STUDY: Index size As one can expect, increasing the index size at inference time improves performance. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we evaluated our model with an index containing 10%, 30%, 50% and 70% images of PMD dataset, and obtained FID scores of 13.92, 13.85, 13.72, and 13.65 respectively. kNN conditioning We examined several different approaches to kNN input conditioning: (i) forwarding the kNN embeddings and the single image embedding through a self-attention layer before feeding the contextualized K +1 embeddings to the model, (ii) feeding the model with one embedding, computed using cross-attention between the image embedding and the kNN embeddings, and, (iii) feeding the model with the image embedding concatenated with a learned linear projection of the kNN embeddings. These variants received FID scores of 18.3, 22.4, 34.1 respectively. 6.4 RETRIEVAL MODEL: The retrieval model is implemented using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019). FAISS is an efficient database, capable of storing billions of elements and finding their nearest neighbors in milliseconds. In the pre-process phase we store the image index and its corresponding CLIP image embedding. Then, during training we search for the nearest neighbors using the image index. The photo-realistic dataset contains 69M samples, and the sticker dataset contains 400M samples. For an efficient search during training and inference, we use an inverted file index. As in Babenko & Lempitsky (2014), we define Voronoi cells in the d-dimensional space (where d = 512 is the CLIP embedding dimensional space), s.t each database vector falls in one of the cells. When searching for an image I , the nearest neighbors are retrieved only from the cluster that I falls in, and from the 19 other neighboring clusters. In order to fit the index of our large-scale datasets on a 128GB RAM server, we compress the code size from 4d = 2048 to 256 using optimized product quantization (Ge et al., 2013; Jegou et al., 2010). 6.5 DISCRETE KNN MODEL: We provide additional implementation details for the discrete diffusion model. Vector Quantization For token quantization, we use VQ-VAE and adapt the publicly available VQGAN(Esser et al., 2021) model, trained on the OpenImages(Krasin et al., 2016) dataset. The encoder downsamples images to 32\u00d732 tokens and uses a codebook vocabulary with 2887 elements. Image Tokenization In our discrete generative model we model images as a sequence of discrete tokens. To this end, we utilize a vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) (Van Den Oord et al., 2017) as image tokenizer. VQ-VAE consists of three components: (i) an encoder, (ii) a learned codebook, and, (iii) a decoder. Given an image, the encoder extracts a latent representation. The codebook then maps each latent vector representation to its nearest vector in the codebook. Finally, the decoder reconstructs the image from the codebook representation. VQ-VAE is trained with the objectives of reconstruction and codebook learning. VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021) adds an adversarial loss term that tries to determine whether the generated image is fake or real. This added term was shown to improve reconstruction quality. Transformer We follow Gu et al. (2021) and train a decoder-only Transformer. The decoder module contains 24 transformer blocks, each containing full attention, cross-attention for the concatenated conditioner, and a feed-forward network. The timestamp n is injected using Adaptive Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016). The decoder contains 400 million parameters, which is merely a tenth of baseline models such as CogView, DALL\u00b7E, and GLIDE. We use the same architecture for both sticker and photo-realistic image generation. Classifier-free guidance We sample our diffusion models using classifier-free guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2021; Nichol et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022). CFG is performed by extrapolating an unconditional sample in the direction of a conditional sample. To support unconditional sampling, previous work had to fine-tune (Nichol et al., 2021) their models with 20% of the conditional features nullified. This enabled them to sample unconditional images from the model using the null condition, y\u2032 = \u2212\u2192 0 , the null vector. We found that we can generate unconditional samples from our model using null conditioning without fine-tuning it. We hypothesize that by conditioning the model on a null vector, the cross-attention component is also nullified, resulting in no contribution to the diffusion process. During inference, in each step of the diffusion process we generate two images: conditional image logits, p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y), conditioned on the desired multi-modal embedding y, and the unconditional image logits, p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y\u2032), conditioned on the null embedding. Then, the final image for a diffusion step n is sampled from p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y) =p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y\u2032)+ \u03bb(p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y)\u2212 p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn, y\u2032)) where \u03bb is a scale coefficient. In all of our experiments, we set \u03bb = 8, which was found to yield the highest FID scores on the validation set. Note that the above extrapolation occurs directly on the logits output by p\u03b8, in contrast to GLIDE (Nichol et al., 2021), which extrapolates the pixel values. Training Objective For completeness we are adding the training objective of the discrete model. The network is trained to minimize the variational lower bound (VLB): Lvlb = L0 + L1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ LN\u22121 + LN , L0 = \u2212 log p\u03b8(x0|x1,y), Ln\u22121 = q(xn\u22121|xn,x0)p\u03b8(xn\u22121|xn,y), LN = q(xN |x0)p(xN ). (1) Where p(xN ) is the prior distribution of timestep N . In all of our experiments N = 1000. The full details can be found in Gu et al. (2021). Algorithms We provide the training algorithm 1 and the inference algorithm 2 for the discrete diffusion model.

Note that both CogView and VQ-Diffusion have been trained on an ImageText paired dataset, whereas our model was not trained on the COCO dataset, nor used it in the retrieval model. Sticker generation In Fig. 13 we present a visual comparison of our discrete model, trained on the stickers dataset with (1) the kNN extracted during inference, (2) the same model without using kNN in inference. As can be seen, the stickers generated by our model are better aligned to the corresponding text compared to the baselines. While the baselines fail with challenging prompts, our model produces high-quality images that align with the text, and composes multiple concepts correctly. 6.6 CONTINUOUS KNN MODEL: Decoder. We followed (Nichol et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Ramesh et al., 2022) and re-implemented a diffusion U-net model. Specifically, we modify the architecture described in (Ramesh et al., 2022) by allowing multiple CLIP embeddings as the condition to the model. Since we do not have a paired text-image dataset, we removed the text transformer, and thus the text embedding. Similarly to our discrete model, we trained two models (1) a no-kNN conditioned only on CLIP image embedding during training, (2) a kNN conditioned on CLIP image embedding and its kNN. Finally, we enable classifier-free guidance by randomly setting the CLIP embeddings to zero 10% of the time. As demonstrated in Tab. 2, we find that humans prefer our model over no-kNN 66.8% of the time for image quality and 69.4% of the time for text alignment. Super-Resolution. As the decoder generates images with 64 \u00d7 64 resolution, we up-sampled the images to 256\u00d7 256 using the open-source super resolution of (Nichol et al., 2021). To further upsample the images to 512\u00d7512 and 1024\u00d71024 we used the open-source super resolution provided by (Wang et al., 2021). Training Objectives For completeness we are addding the training objective of our continous model. Following Ho et al. (2020); Nichol et al. (2021) we are using mean-squared error loss to predict the noise: L := En\u223c[1,N ],x0\u223cq(x0),\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)[||\u03f5\u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xn, n, y)|| 2] where \u03f5\u03b8 is a U \u2212 net model and y is the condition for the model. In all of our experiments N = 1000. 6.7 TEXT-ONLY IMAGE MANIPULATION: Our approach is illustrated in Fig. 11. Additional manipulation examples are provided in Figs. 18. The full comparison with the baselines is provided in Fig. 19 and 20. We also provide in Fig. 12 several examples for the process of the manipulated images construction. 6.8 ADDITIONAL SAMPLES: Additional samples generated from challenging text inputs are provided in Figs.

This approach has distinct strengths but also inherent limitations that manifest as specific visual artifacts.\\n\\nAssuming kNN-Diffusion aims to produce high-fidelity images, here's a detailed evaluation of common issues and how to address them:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Impression\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion models often demonstrate promising capabilities in capturing broad stylistic elements and sometimes intricate local textures. They can be particularly good at texture synthesis when the source dataset provides good matches. However, they frequently struggle with global coherence, fine detail preservation, and seamless integration, leading to a distinct \\\"patched-together\\\" or \\\"unnatural\\\" look compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models without explicit kNN components for synthesis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Strengths (Potential)\\n\\n1.  **Texture Synthesis:** Can reproduce convincing local textures if the kNN search space is rich and relevant.\\n2.  **Novel Combinations:** Ability to create images that combine elements in ways not directly present in any single training image.\\n3.  **Local Detail:** Sometimes excels at very specific, localized details where a good nearest neighbor match is found.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Areas for Improvement: Visual Fidelity & Artifact Presence\\n\\n**1. Visual Fidelity & Detail Preservation:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** Images often lack crispness and fine detail, especially in complex areas like faces, hands, text, or intricate patterns. High-frequency information is frequently lost or smoothed out.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Blurriness/Softness:** General lack of sharpness, making objects appear out of focus.\\n    *   **Loss of Micro-Details:** Hair strands, individual pores, fabric textures, or tiny elements are often smeared or non-existent.\\n    *   **\\\"Melted\\\" or \\\"Smudged\\\" Appearance:** Particularly noticeable in organic forms, where features seem to blend unnaturally.\\n\\n**2. Texture & Local Coherence:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** This is a hallmark challenge for kNN-based methods. Textures, while sometimes locally convincing, often exhibit inconsistencies over larger areas.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Patch Artifacts/Seams:** Visible boundaries or abrupt transitions where different kNN patches have been stitched together, resembling a collage.\\n    *   **Repetitive Patterns:** Due to the limited diversity of selected nearest neighbors, certain texture elements or patterns might repeat unnaturally.\\n    *   **Inconsistent Texture Scale/Orientation:** A brick wall might have different brick sizes or alignments in different sections.\\n    *   **\\\"Gibberish\\\" Textures:** When no good match is found, the model might synthesize a chaotic, meaningless texture.\\n\\n**3. Global Structure & Plausibility:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** The primary weakness of patch-based or local-neighbor synthesis. While local elements might look fine, the overall composition, anatomical correctness, and logical consistency suffer.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Anatomical Distortions:** Malformed hands, disproportionate limbs, strange facial features (e.g., extra eyes, misplaced noses).\\n    *   **Object Disintegration/Merging:** Objects can appear to break apart or blend into the background/other objects unnaturally.\\n    *   **Inconsistent Perspective/Proportions:** Different parts of the scene may appear to be rendered from different viewpoints or with incorrect relative sizes.\\n    *   **Illogical Scene Composition:** Elements may be placed randomly or defy gravity/physical laws.\\n\\n**4. Color & Tonal Accuracy:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** Color palettes can be inconsistent, leading to unnatural variations in lighting or hue across an image. Tonal ranges might be compressed or exaggerated.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Color Shifts/Splotches:** Patches of noticeably different color or brightness that don't correspond to natural lighting or material properties.\\n    *   **Desaturation/Over-saturation:** Areas might appear washed out or overly vibrant without cause.\\n    *   **Inconsistent Lighting/Shadows:** Shadows may fall illogically or contradict the apparent light source.\\n\\n**5. Noise & Other Artifacts:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** Varying levels of noise, from general graininess to more structured pixel artifacts.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Graininess/Pixel Noise:** Random, noisy pixels, especially in uniform areas or shadows.\\n    *   **Aliasing/Jagged Edges:** Stair-stepping on diagonal lines, though less common in modern diffusion models, can be reintroduced by naive kNN applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Specific Feedback & Recommendations for Improvement\\n\\nTo address the identified issues, improvements can be focused on the model architecture, training methodology, and inference procedures:\\n\\n**1. Enhance Visual Fidelity & Detail:**\\n\\n*   **Model Architecture:**\\n    *   **High-Resolution Training:** Train on larger, higher-resolution datasets.\\n    *   **Multi-Scale Architectures:** Employ U-Net or similar architectures with skip connections that preserve high-frequency information across different scales.\\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Integrate global and local attention mechanisms to better capture dependencies and maintain fine details.\\n    *   **Upsampling Refinement:** Use more sophisticated upsampling methods (e.g., sub-pixel convolution, learnable upsampling) rather than simple interpolation.\\n*   **Loss Functions:**\\n    *   **Perceptual Loss (VGG Loss):** Encourage the model to produce images that are perceptually similar to real images, not just pixel-wise.\\n    *   **Adversarial Loss (GAN component):** If applicable, a discriminator can push the generator towards more realistic, detailed outputs.\\n\\n**2. Improve Texture & Local Coherence:**\\n\\n*   **Context-Aware kNN:**\\n    *   **Semantic-Aware Nearest Neighbors:** Instead of just low-level features, incorporate higher-level semantic information (e.g., object types, boundaries) into the kNN search to find more contextually appropriate patches.\\n    *   **Global Conditioning:** Condition the kNN selection and blending on global image features or a latent representation of the entire scene.\\n*   **Advanced Blending Techniques:**\\n    *   **Content-Aware Blending:** Implement techniques like Poisson blending, multi-band blending, or learned blending networks to seamlessly stitch kNN patches together, minimizing visible seams.\\n    *   **Overlap & Feathering:** Ensure significant overlap between neighboring patches and apply smooth feathering functions.\\n*   **Recurrent/Iterative Refinement:**\\n    *   Allow the model to iteratively refine generated regions, using subsequent passes to improve local consistency based on the broader context.\\n\\n**3. Strengthen Global Structure & Plausibility:**\\n\\n*   **Hierarchical Generation:**\\n    *   **Coarse-to-Fine Approach:** Generate a low-resolution, globally coherent image first, then use kNN-Diffusion to progressively add finer details and textures at higher resolutions, guided by the initial coarse structure.\\n    *   **Layout/Semantic Map Conditioning:** Condition the generation on input layout maps or semantic segmentation masks to ensure objects are placed logically and have correct proportions.\\n*   **Stronger Global Feature Extractors:**\\n    *   Integrate components (e.g., transformer blocks) that can effectively model long-range dependencies and global scene understanding *before* or *during* the kNN-Diffusion process.\\n*   **Larger & Diverse Datasets:**\\n    *   Exposure to a wider variety of globally consistent images will help the model learn more robust structural patterns.\\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** For applications where some manual intervention is acceptable, allow for selective re-generation or manipulation of problematic areas.\\n\\n**4. Enhance Color & Tonal Accuracy:**\\n\\n*   **Robust Normalization:** Implement better color normalization and standardization during training.\\n*   **Color Space Awareness:** Train the model with awareness of color spaces (e.g., CIE Lab, HSV) rather than just RGB, which can sometimes lead to more perceptually uniform results.\\n*   **Lighting/Shadow Modeling:** Integrate components that explicitly model light sources and shadow propagation for more consistent illumination.\\n*   **Color Transfer Techniques:** Consider a post-processing step for color grading or style transfer if the base model struggles with color consistency.\\n\\n**5. Reduce Noise & Other Artifacts:**\\n\\n*   **Improved Denoising Steps:** Refine the denoising network within the diffusion process to more effectively remove noise while preserving detail.\\n*   **Regularization:** Apply stronger regularization during training to prevent overfitting and the generation of noisy patterns.\\n*   **Sampling Schedule Optimization:** Experiment with different noise schedules and sampling steps during inference to find a balance between speed and artifact reduction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy systematically addressing these points, kNN-Diffusion models can significantly improve their image quality, reduce visual artifacts, and achieve higher levels of visual fidelity and naturalness.

During the iterative denoising process, it retrieves neighbors from this dataset based on the current noisy latent state, and uses these neighbors to guide or correct the diffusion model's prediction.\\n\\nLet's break down the relevance and impact of this retrieval mechanism:\\n\\n### 1. Relevance of Retrieved Images\\n\\nThe relevance of retrieved images is paramount to the success of kNN-Diffusion.\\n\\n*   **What defines relevance?** In kNN-Diffusion, relevance is primarily defined by the proximity in the *latent space* of the diffusion model at a given noise level. A \\\"relevant\\\" neighbor is one whose noisy latent representation is close to the current noisy latent representation of the image being generated. The assumption is that if the noisy latents are similar, their corresponding denoised counterparts should also be similar or provide useful guidance.\\n*   **Challenges to Relevance:**\\n    *   **Semantic vs. Perceptual Similarity:** Proximity in latent space doesn't always guarantee semantic alignment, especially in high-dimensional spaces or at very high noise levels where distinct semantic concepts might appear structurally similar.\\n    *   **Noise Level Dependence:** A neighbor that's relevant at a high noise level (e.g., capturing overall structure) might not be the most relevant at a low noise level (where fine details matter). The kNN search is typically performed on the *noisy* latent.\\n    *   **Dataset Content:** The quality and diversity of the external kNN dataset directly dictate the relevance of potential neighbors. If the dataset lacks relevant examples for a particular generation task, the retrieved neighbors will be suboptimal.\\n    *   **Curse of Dimensionality:** In very high-dimensional latent spaces, all points can appear \\\"far\\\" from each other, making true nearest neighbors elusive or less meaningful. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithms are crucial here but can introduce errors.\\n\\n### 2. Impact on the Generation Process\\n\\nThe kNN retrieval mechanism fundamentally alters the diffusion process from a purely generative one to a data-conditioned generative one.\\n\\n*   **Guidance and Correction:** The retrieved neighbors provide a strong inductive bias. The denoising step, instead of solely relying on the U-Net's learned score function, is *pulled* towards the predicted clean versions of the retrieved neighbors. This acts as a powerful correction signal, especially when the U-Net is uncertain or prone to hallucination.\\n*   **Grounding in Real Data:** By continuously referencing real data points, kNN-Diffusion anchors the generation process to actual examples, reducing the likelihood of generating artifacts, anatomically incorrect features, or outputs that deviate significantly from real-world distributions.\\n*   **Knowledge Transfer:** It implicitly transfers knowledge from the vast kNN dataset to the generative process without explicitly fine-tuning the diffusion model on that data. This is particularly useful for rare or long-tail concepts that might not be well-represented in the original training data of the diffusion model.\\n*   **Fidelity at Different Scales:** The impact can vary across denoising steps. At higher noise levels (early steps), neighbors might guide global structure. At lower noise levels (later steps), they can refine fine-grained details and textures.\\n\\n### 3. Effect on Quality of Generated Images\\n\\nThe impact on quality is generally positive but comes with caveats.\\n\\n*   **Positive Impacts:**\\n    *   **Increased Realism and Fidelity:** By leveraging real-world examples, kNN-Diffusion significantly improves the photo-realism and perceptual quality of generated images. Features like textures, lighting, and object coherence are often enhanced.\\n    *   **Reduced Hallucination/Artifacts:** The strong pull towards existing data points helps to suppress common generative model issues like \\\"blobby\\\" shapes, incoherent textures, or physically impossible structures.\\n    *   **Improved Handling of Niche/Rare Concepts:** If the external dataset contains examples of concepts underrepresented in the original training data, kNN-Diffusion can generate higher-quality images for those concepts.\\n    *   **Sharpness and Detail:** Neighbors can provide detailed high-frequency information that the U-Net might struggle to reconstruct on its own, leading to sharper and more intricate results.\\n\\n*   **Negative Impacts (if retrieval is suboptimal):**\\n    *   **Introduction of Artifacts:** If *irrelevant* or *misleading* neighbors are retrieved, they can introduce noise, unwanted features, or \\\"stitching\\\" artifacts where elements from disparate neighbors are combined incoherently.\\n    *   **Over-regularization:** An overly strong kNN influence can sometimes smooth out legitimate variations or overly regularize the output, leading to a \\\"canned\\\" or \\\"averaged\\\" look.\\n    *   **Reliance on Database Quality:** The output quality is inherently limited by the quality of the kNN database. If the database contains low-quality or mislabeled data, these flaws can propagate.\\n\\n### 4. Effect on Diversity of Generated Images\\n\\nThe impact on diversity is a critical trade-off and often a negative consequence.\\n\\n*   **Negative Impacts:**\\n    *   **Reduced Diversity (Mode Collapse Tendency):** This is the most significant concern. By constantly pulling the generation towards existing data points, kNN-Diffusion inherently discourages exploration of the latent space *between* data points. The generated images tend to cluster around the modes represented in the external kNN dataset, leading to less novel or varied outputs.\\n    *   **\\\"Database Look\\\":** Generated images might start to look \\\"too similar\\\" to specific examples in the database, reducing the sense of truly novel creation.\\n    *   **Difficulty in Interpolation:** Interpolating between distinct concepts or styles might become harder if the kNN guidance pulls too strongly towards specific examples rather than allowing the diffusion model to explore the latent space.\\n\\n*   **Potential for Positive (but less common) Impacts:**\\n    *   In a *highly diverse* kNN database, and with careful balancing of the kNN influence, it's *theoretically* possible for the model to synthesize novel combinations of features observed in different neighbors, thereby contributing to diversity. However, in practice, the bias towards existing modes often dominates.\\n\\n### 5. Optimizing the Retrieval Strategy for Improved Performance\\n\\nOptimizing the kNN retrieval strategy is crucial for balancing quality and diversity, and for maximizing the benefits of kNN-Diffusion.\\n\\n1.  **Database Content and Size:**\\n    *   **Quality:** Use a clean, high-resolution, and well-curated external dataset. Noise or poor quality in the database directly translates to degradation in generated images.\\n    *   **Diversity:** Ensure the database is as diverse as possible across relevant dimensions (styles, content, lighting, composition) to support a wider range of generations and mitigate mode collapse. A larger database generally allows for more relevant neighbors, but increases retrieval time.\\n    *   **Relevance:** The database should be relevant to the expected generation tasks.\\n\\n2.  **Distance Metric and Feature Space:**\\n    *   **Latent Space Proximity:** The kNN search should occur in a meaningful feature space. kNN-Diffusion typically uses the noisy latent space of the diffusion model itself, as this space is directly relevant to the U-Net's operation.\\n    *   **Beyond L2:** Explore other distance metrics or learned similarity functions that better capture semantic or perceptual similarity (e.g., using features from a pre-trained vision model like CLIP or DINO for initial filtering, or a weighted L2).\\n\\n3.  **Number of Neighbors (k):**\\n    *   **Balancing Act:** `k` is a hyperparameter that directly controls the trade-off.\\n        *   **Small `k`:** Stronger pull from specific examples, potentially leading to higher fidelity if neighbors are perfect, but higher risk of artifacts from irrelevant neighbors and reduced diversity.\\n        *   **Large `k`:** Smoother guidance from an \\\"average\\\" of neighbors, potentially more robust to individual bad neighbors, but can dilute unique features and still lead to mode collapse around dense regions.\\n    *   **Dynamic `k`:** Vary `k` based on the noise level or generation step. For example, use a larger `k` at early, high-noise steps for global structure, and a smaller `k` at later, low-noise steps for fine details.\\n\\n4.  **Integration Method (How kNN Influences U-Net):**\\n    *   **Weighting:** Adjust the weighting of the kNN guidance term relative to the U-Net's prediction. A higher weight means stronger guidance from the neighbors, potentially higher fidelity but lower diversity.\\n    *   **Adaptive Weighting:** Make the weighting dynamic based on factors like the distance to the nearest neighbor (closer means higher confidence/weight), or the current noise level.\\n    *   **Beyond Simple Interpolation:** Explore more sophisticated fusion mechanisms, such as using attention, gradient-based guidance, or learning a fusion network.\\n\\n5.  **Retrieval Frequency and Time Steps:**\\n    *   **Per-Step Retrieval:** The standard kNN-Diffusion retrieves neighbors at every denoising step. This is computationally intensive but provides continuous guidance.\\n    *   **Sparse Retrieval:** Experiment with retrieving neighbors only at certain key steps, or less frequently, to reduce computational overhead while still providing some guidance.\\n\\n6.  **Indexing and Search Efficiency:**\\n    *   **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):** Utilize efficient ANN search libraries (e.g., Faiss, HNSW, Annoy) to perform quick searches in large databases. This is critical for practical deployment.\\n\\n7.  **Filtering and Refinement:**\\n    *   **Pre-filtering:** Before using neighbors, apply filters based on additional metadata or semantic similarity checks to discard clearly irrelevant ones.\\n    *   **Neighbor Consensus:** If `k` is large, consider statistical properties of the neighbors (e.g., standard deviation of their predicted clean values) to assess their coherence and adjust guidance strength.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the kNN retrieval mechanism in kNN-Diffusion offers a powerful way to inject real-world knowledge into generative models, significantly boosting realism and fidelity. However, it introduces a strong bias towards the kNN database, posing a considerable challenge to diversity. Optimizing the retrieval strategy involves careful curation of the external dataset, intelligent selection of k, adaptive integration of the kNN signal, and efficient search algorithms, all aimed at finding the sweet spot between high-quality, grounded generations and novel, diverse outputs.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.8829283\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"RetrievalRelevanceAnalyst\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Analyze the relevance and impact of the kNN retrieval mechanism on the image generation process in kNN-Diffusion.

This design has distinct implications for semantic alignment, leading to particular strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment:**\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion generally excels at producing **high-fidelity, realistic images** that accurately ground common objects and scenes present in its retrieval database. It struggles, however, with **novel compositions, abstract concepts, precise relational understanding, and subtle semantic nuances** that are not well-represented or derivable from direct nearest neighbors. Its alignment tends to be strong for \\\"what\\\" an object is, but weaker for \\\"how\\\" it interacts or \\\"what kind\\\" of nuanced attribute it possesses, especially for concepts not directly found in the kNN database.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Successful Alignments (Strengths)\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion's strength lies in its ability to retrieve and integrate real-world visual information, leading to:\\n\\n1.  **High Fidelity and Realism:** Because it directly incorporates visual features from real images, the generated outputs often possess a photographic quality and fine-grained detail that can be superior for common objects.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \\\"A majestic golden retriever playing fetch in a sunlit park.\\\"\\n    *   **Expected Success:** The model would likely generate a highly realistic golden retriever, with accurate fur texture and proportions, in a convincingly rendered park setting with appropriate lighting. The dog would probably be holding or chasing a ball.\\n    *   **Reason for Success:** Both \\\"golden retriever,\\\" \\\"fetch,\\\" \\\"park,\\\" and \\\"sunlit\\\" are concepts with abundant, high-quality visual representations in large datasets. The kNN retrieval can pull relevant examples that guide the diffusion process toward realism and detail for these common elements.\\n\\n2.  **Grounding of Common Objects and Scenes:** If a concept is well-represented in the kNN database, the model can accurately depict its visual characteristics.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \\\"The Eiffel Tower at sunset with a few tourists around.\\\"\\n    *   **Expected Success:** A clearly recognizable Eiffel Tower, accurate proportions, realistic lighting for sunset, and believable figures of tourists.\\n    *   **Reason for Success:** The Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark with countless images. The kNN component can directly inject visual cues for the tower's structure, the lighting of a sunset, and the appearance of tourists, leading to strong semantic alignment for these primary elements.\\n\\n3.  **Capturing Specific Instance Details (if in database):** For very specific, well-documented entities, the retrieval mechanism can aid in accurate representation.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \\\"A red 1965 Ford Mustang parked on a suburban street.\\\"\\n    *   **Expected Success:** A very accurate depiction of a 1965 Ford Mustang, distinguishable from other car models, in a plausible street environment.\\n    *   **Reason for Success:** If the kNN database contains numerous images of this specific car model, the retrieval step significantly constrains the output towards that correct visual identity, leading to strong alignment with the vehicle type.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Unsuccessful Alignments (Weaknesses)\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion's reliance on retrieval can hinder performance when prompts demand:\\n\\n1.  **Abstract Concepts and Metaphors:** Ideas that don't have a direct, tangible visual equivalent in the database will be difficult to represent accurately.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \\\"The silence screamed in the empty room.\\\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** The image might show an empty room, perhaps even one that feels silent. However, it's highly unlikely to visually convey \\\"silence screamed\\\" in a meaningful or semantically aligned way. The model would struggle to visualize a metaphor.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** \\\"Silence screaming\\\" is an abstract, metaphorical concept. There are no direct visual nearest neighbors for this. The model's diffusion process, guided by kNN, lacks the inherent generative capacity for such a conceptual leap without explicit visual training data.\\n\\n2.  **Complex Relational Understanding (Verbs, Prepositions):** While individual objects might be present, the precise spatial or action-based relationships between them can be weak or misinterpreted.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \\\"A cat chasing a mouse under a kitchen table.\\\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** The image might show a cat, a mouse, and a kitchen table. However, the \\\"chasing\\\" action might be static or unclear, and the \\\"under the table\\\" relationship might be poorly executed (e.g., mouse next to table, or cat on table).\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** While \\\"cat,\\\" \\\"mouse,\\\" and \\\"kitchen table\\\" are common, the precise dynamics of \\\"chasing\\\" and the spatial \\\"under\\\" are harder to infer solely from retrieving static images.

However, the \\\"steampunk griffin\\\" might look generic or like a normal griffin, and the act of \\\"delivering pizza\\\" might be absent or just implied, lacking semantic cohesion for the novel concept.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** While individual components like \\\"griffin,\\\" \\\"steampunk,\\\" \\\"pizza,\\\" and \\\"moon\\\" might have visual representations, the specific, novel combination of a \\\"steampunk griffin delivering pizza\\\" is highly unlikely to have direct nearest neighbors. The kNN system might retrieve disparate parts that are then imperfectly blended by the diffusion process, leading to weak alignment for the overall novel concept.\\n\\n5.  **Subtle Attributes and Emotional Nuances:** Expressing delicate variations or emotions is hard without direct visual examples.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \\\"A subtly melancholic robot contemplating its existence.\\\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** It might generate a robot. \\\"Contemplating its existence\\\" is abstract and hard to visualize. \\\"Subtly melancholic\\\" is an emotional nuance that is extremely difficult to convey purely through visual form, especially if the kNN retrieval leans towards generic robot poses.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** Emotional and highly nuanced attributes often require an understanding of context, body language, or facial expressions that are not easily captured or synthesized purely from retrieving similar-looking objects.\\n\\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\\n\\nTo enhance text-to-image semantic alignment in kNN-Diffusion and similar models:\\n\\n1.  **Prompt-Aware Retrieval:** Instead of just finding nearest image neighbors in embedding space, develop retrieval mechanisms that understand the *intent* of the prompt more deeply. This could involve:\\n    *   **Scene Graph Parsing:** Decompose the prompt into objects, attributes, and relationships (e.g., \\\"cat\\\" (object), \\\"chasing\\\" (action), \\\"mouse\\\" (object), \\\"under\\\" (relation), \\\"table\\\" (object)). Retrieve images not just for individual components but also for the specified relationships.\\n    *   **Multi-Modal Reasoning:** Integrate additional modalities (e.g., video clips for actions, textual descriptions for abstract concepts) during retrieval to better inform the generation.\\n    *   **Hierarchical Retrieval:** Retrieve at multiple levels of abstraction \u2013 overall scene, main subjects, and then fine-grained details/attributes.\\n\\n2.  **Finer-Grained Control over Integration:** Improve how the retrieved images guide the diffusion process:\\n    *   **Adaptive Blending:** Instead of a fixed influence, allow the model to dynamically decide how much to rely on retrieved images versus its own generative capacity, especially for novel parts of the prompt.\\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Use attention mechanisms to ensure specific parts of the retrieved images influence corresponding parts of the generated image, respecting object boundaries and semantic regions.\\n    *   **Semantic Segmentation Guidance:** Use semantic maps derived from the prompt or retrieved images to guide the placement and rendering of objects and their interactions more accurately.\\n\\n3.  **Enhanced Generative Capacity for Novelty:** While kNN excels at realism, the diffusion model itself needs to be robust enough to \\\"hallucinate\\\" or synthesize novel elements when direct retrieval isn't sufficient. This involves:\\n    *   **More Diverse and Conceptually Rich Training Data:** Training the base diffusion model on an even wider array of concepts, including abstract ones, or synthetic data specifically designed to teach relational understanding.\\n    *   **Compositional Learning:** Explicitly training the model to compose disparate elements into coherent scenes, rather than relying solely on nearest neighbors.\\n\\n4.  **Feedback Loops and Reinforcement Learning:** Incorporate human feedback (RLHF) to refine the model's understanding of semantic alignment, particularly for complex or subjective prompts. Users could rate how well images match their intent, guiding the model's future generations.\\n\\n5.  **Hybrid Architectures:** Explore combining kNN-Diffusion with other techniques, such as:\\n    *   **Text-to-3D Integration:** Generate rough 3D scene compositions from prompts, then use kNN-Diffusion to texture and refine the scene.\\n    *   **ControlNet-like Conditioning:** Allow users or an internal module to provide additional spatial or structural guidance (e.g., depth maps, pose estimation) based on prompt understanding.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, kNN-Diffusion and similar retrieval-augmented generative models can move beyond simply depicting \\\"what is common\\\" to accurately reflecting the full meaning and intent of highly complex and novel text prompts.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.88201135\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"TextAlignmentEvaluator\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the alignment between the generated images and the input text prompts in kNN-Diffusion.

They can be particularly good at texture synthesis when the source dataset provides good matches. However, they frequently struggle with global coherence, fine detail preservation, and seamless integration, leading to a distinct \"patched-together\" or \"unnatural\" look compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models without explicit kNN components for synthesis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Strengths (Potential)\\n\\n1.  **Texture Synthesis:** Can reproduce convincing local textures if the kNN search space is rich and relevant.\\n2.  **Novel Combinations:** Ability to create images that combine elements in ways not directly present in any single training image.\\n3.  **Local Detail:** Sometimes excels at very specific, localized details where a good nearest neighbor match is found.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Areas for Improvement: Visual Fidelity & Artifact Presence\\n\\n**1. Visual Fidelity & Detail Preservation:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** Images often lack crispness and fine detail, especially in complex areas like faces, hands, text, or intricate patterns. High-frequency information is frequently lost or smoothed out.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Blurriness/Softness:** General lack of sharpness, making objects appear out of focus.\\n    *   **Loss of Micro-Details:** Hair strands, individual pores, fabric textures, or tiny elements are often smeared or non-existent.\\n    *   **\"Melted\" or \"Smudged\" Appearance:** Particularly noticeable in organic forms, where features seem to blend unnaturally.\\n\\n**2. Texture & Local Coherence:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** This is a hallmark challenge for kNN-based methods. Textures, while sometimes locally convincing, often exhibit inconsistencies over larger areas.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Patch Artifacts/Seams:** Visible boundaries or abrupt transitions where different kNN patches have been stitched together, resembling a collage.\\n    *   **Repetitive Patterns:** Due to the limited diversity of selected nearest neighbors, certain texture elements or patterns might repeat unnaturally.\\n    *   **Inconsistent Texture Scale/Orientation:** A brick wall might have different brick sizes or alignments in different sections.\\n    *   **\"Gibberish\" Textures:** When no good match is found, the model might synthesize a chaotic, meaningless texture.\\n\\n**3. Global Structure & Plausibility:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** The primary weakness of patch-based or local-neighbor synthesis. While local elements might look fine, the overall composition, anatomical correctness, and logical consistency suffer.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Anatomical Distortions:** Malformed hands, disproportionate limbs, strange facial features (e.g., extra eyes, misplaced noses).\\n    *   **Object Disintegration/Merging:** Objects can appear to break apart or blend into the background/other objects unnaturally.\\n    *   **Inconsistent Perspective/Proportions:** Different parts of the scene may appear to be rendered from different viewpoints or with incorrect relative sizes.\\n    *   **Illogical Scene Composition:** Elements may be placed randomly or defy gravity/physical laws.\\n\\n**4. Color & Tonal Accuracy:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** Color palettes can be inconsistent, leading to unnatural variations in lighting or hue across an image. Tonal ranges might be compressed or exaggerated.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Color Shifts/Splotches:** Patches of noticeably different color or brightness that don\\'t correspond to natural lighting or material properties.\\n    *   **Desaturation/Over-saturation:** Areas might appear washed out or overly vibrant without cause.\\n    *   **Inconsistent Lighting/Shadows:** Shadows may fall illogically or contradict the apparent light source.\\n\\n**5. Noise & Other Artifacts:**\\n\\n*   **Observation:** Varying levels of noise, from general graininess to more structured pixel artifacts.\\n*   **Artifacts:**\\n    *   **Graininess/Pixel Noise:** Random, noisy pixels, especially in uniform areas or shadows.\\n    *   **Aliasing/Jagged Edges:** Stair-stepping on diagonal lines, though less common in modern diffusion models, can be reintroduced by naive kNN applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Specific Feedback & Recommendations for Improvement\\n\\nTo address the identified issues, improvements can be focused on the model architecture, training methodology, and inference procedures:\\n\\n**1. Enhance Visual Fidelity & Detail:**\\n\\n*   **Model Architecture:**\\n    *   **High-Resolution Training:** Train on larger, higher-resolution datasets.\\n    *   **Multi-Scale Architectures:** Employ U-Net or similar architectures with skip connections that preserve high-frequency information across different scales.\\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Integrate global and local attention mechanisms to better capture dependencies and maintain fine details.\\n    *   **Upsampling Refinement:** Use more sophisticated upsampling methods (e.g., sub-pixel convolution, learnable upsampling) rather than simple interpolation.\\n*   **Loss Functions:**\\n    *   **Perceptual Loss (VGG Loss):** Encourage the model to produce images that are perceptually similar to real images, not just pixel-wise.\\n    *   **Adversarial Loss (GAN component):** If applicable, a discriminator can push the generator towards more realistic, detailed outputs.\\n\\n**2. Improve Texture & Local Coherence:**\\n\\n*   **Context-Aware kNN:**\\n    *   **Semantic-Aware Nearest Neighbors:** Instead of just low-level features, incorporate higher-level semantic information (e.g., object types, boundaries) into the kNN search to find more contextually appropriate patches.\\n    *   **Global Conditioning:** Condition the kNN selection and blending on global image features or a latent representation of the entire scene.\\n*   **Advanced Blending Techniques:**\\n    *   **Content-Aware Blending:** Implement techniques like Poisson blending, multi-band blending, or learned blending networks to seamlessly stitch kNN patches together, minimizing visible seams.\\n    *   **Overlap & Feathering:** Ensure significant overlap between neighboring patches and apply smooth feathering functions.\\n*   **Recurrent/Iterative Refinement:**\\n    *   Allow the model to iteratively refine generated regions, using subsequent passes to improve local consistency based on the broader context.\\n\\n**3. Strengthen Global Structure & Plausibility:**\\n\\n*   **Hierarchical Generation:**\\n    *   **Coarse-to-Fine Approach:** Generate a low-resolution, globally coherent image first, then use kNN-Diffusion to progressively add finer details and textures at higher resolutions, guided by the initial coarse structure.\\n    *   **Layout/Semantic Map Conditioning:** Condition the generation on input layout maps or semantic segmentation masks to ensure objects are placed logically and have correct proportions.\\n*   **Stronger Global Feature Extractors:**\\n    *   Integrate components (e.g., transformer blocks) that can effectively model long-range dependencies and global scene understanding *before* or *during* the kNN-Diffusion process.\\n*   **Larger & Diverse Datasets:**\\n    *   Exposure to a wider variety of globally consistent images will help the model learn more robust structural patterns.\\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** For applications where some manual intervention is acceptable, allow for selective re-generation or manipulation of problematic areas.\\n\\n**4. Enhance Color & Tonal Accuracy:**\\n\\n*   **Robust Normalization:** Implement better color normalization and standardization during training.\\n*   **Color Space Awareness:** Train the model with awareness of color spaces (e.g., CIE Lab, HSV) rather than just RGB, which can sometimes lead to more perceptually uniform results.\\n*   **Lighting/Shadow Modeling:** Integrate components that explicitly model light sources and shadow propagation for more consistent illumination.\\n*   **Color Transfer Techniques:** Consider a post-processing step for color grading or style transfer if the base model struggles with color consistency.\\n\\n**5. Reduce Noise & Other Artifacts:**\\n\\n*   **Improved Denoising Steps:** Refine the denoising network within the diffusion process to more effectively remove noise while preserving detail.\\n*   **Regularization:** Apply stronger regularization during training to prevent overfitting and the generation of noisy patterns.\\n*   **Sampling Schedule Optimization:** Experiment with different noise schedules and sampling steps during inference to find a balance between speed and artifact reduction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy systematically addressing these points, kNN-Diffusion models can significantly improve their image quality, reduce visual artifacts, and achieve higher levels of visual fidelity and naturalness. The key lies in balancing the local strength of kNN (for texture/detail) with robust global coherence mechanisms.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.88384375}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'kNN-Diffusion is an innovative approach that augments the generative capabilities of diffusion models by incorporating information from a large, external dataset through k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) retrieval. During the iterative denoising process, it retrieves neighbors from this dataset based on the current noisy latent state, and uses these neighbors to guide or correct the diffusion model\\'s prediction.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the relevance and impact of this retrieval mechanism:\\n\\n### 1. Relevance of Retrieved Images\\n\\nThe relevance of retrieved images is paramount to the success of kNN-Diffusion.\\n\\n*   **What defines relevance?** In kNN-Diffusion, relevance is primarily defined by the proximity in the *latent space* of the diffusion model at a given noise level. A \"relevant\" neighbor is one whose noisy latent representation is close to the current noisy latent representation of the image being generated. The assumption is that if the noisy latents are similar, their corresponding denoised counterparts should also be similar or provide useful guidance.\\n*   **Challenges to Relevance:**\\n    *   **Semantic vs. Perceptual Similarity:** Proximity in latent space doesn\\'t always guarantee semantic alignment, especially in high-dimensional spaces or at very high noise levels where distinct semantic concepts might appear structurally similar.\\n    *   **Noise Level Dependence:** A neighbor that\\'s relevant at a high noise level (e.g., capturing overall structure) might not be the most relevant at a low noise level (where fine details matter). The kNN search is typically performed on the *noisy* latent.\\n    *   **Dataset Content:** The quality and diversity of the external kNN dataset directly dictate the relevance of potential neighbors. If the dataset lacks relevant examples for a particular generation task, the retrieved neighbors will be suboptimal.\\n    *   **Curse of Dimensionality:** In very high-dimensional latent spaces, all points can appear \"far\" from each other, making true nearest neighbors elusive or less meaningful. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithms are crucial here but can introduce errors.\\n\\n### 2. Impact on the Generation Process\\n\\nThe kNN retrieval mechanism fundamentally alters the diffusion process from a purely generative one to a data-conditioned generative one.\\n\\n*   **Guidance and Correction:** The retrieved neighbors provide a strong inductive bias. The denoising step, instead of solely relying on the U-Net\\'s learned score function, is *pulled* towards the predicted clean versions of the retrieved neighbors. This acts as a powerful correction signal, especially when the U-Net is uncertain or prone to hallucination.\\n*   **Grounding in Real Data:** By continuously referencing real data points, kNN-Diffusion anchors the generation process to actual examples, reducing the likelihood of generating artifacts, anatomically incorrect features, or outputs that deviate significantly from real-world distributions.\\n*   **Knowledge Transfer:** It implicitly transfers knowledge from the vast kNN dataset to the generative process without explicitly fine-tuning the diffusion model on that data. This is particularly useful for rare or long-tail concepts that might not be well-represented in the original training data of the diffusion model.\\n*   **Fidelity at Different Scales:** The impact can vary across denoising steps. At higher noise levels (early steps), neighbors might guide global structure. At lower noise levels (later steps), they can refine fine-grained details and textures.\\n\\n### 3. Effect on Quality of Generated Images\\n\\nThe impact on quality is generally positive but comes with caveats.\\n\\n*   **Positive Impacts:**\\n    *   **Increased Realism and Fidelity:** By leveraging real-world examples, kNN-Diffusion significantly improves the photo-realism and perceptual quality of generated images. Features like textures, lighting, and object coherence are often enhanced.\\n    *   **Reduced Hallucination/Artifacts:** The strong pull towards existing data points helps to suppress common generative model issues like \"blobby\" shapes, incoherent textures, or physically impossible structures.\\n    *   **Improved Handling of Niche/Rare Concepts:** If the external dataset contains examples of concepts underrepresented in the original training data, kNN-Diffusion can generate higher-quality images for those concepts.\\n    *   **Sharpness and Detail:** Neighbors can provide detailed high-frequency information that the U-Net might struggle to reconstruct on its own, leading to sharper and more intricate results.\\n\\n*   **Negative Impacts (if retrieval is suboptimal):**\\n    *   **Introduction of Artifacts:** If *irrelevant* or *misleading* neighbors are retrieved, they can introduce noise, unwanted features, or \"stitching\" artifacts where elements from disparate neighbors are combined incoherently.\\n    *   **Over-regularization:** An overly strong kNN influence can sometimes smooth out legitimate variations or overly regularize the output, leading to a \"canned\" or \"averaged\" look.\\n    *   **Reliance on Database Quality:** The output quality is inherently limited by the quality of the kNN database. If the database contains low-quality or mislabeled data, these flaws can propagate.\\n\\n### 4. Effect on Diversity of Generated Images\\n\\nThe impact on diversity is a critical trade-off and often a negative consequence.\\n\\n*   **Negative Impacts:**\\n    *   **Reduced Diversity (Mode Collapse Tendency):** This is the most significant concern. By constantly pulling the generation towards existing data points, kNN-Diffusion inherently discourages exploration of the latent space *between* data points. The generated images tend to cluster around the modes represented in the external kNN dataset, leading to less novel or varied outputs.\\n    *   **\"Database Look\":** Generated images might start to look \"too similar\" to specific examples in the database, reducing the sense of truly novel creation.\\n    *   **Difficulty in Interpolation:** Interpolating between distinct concepts or styles might become harder if the kNN guidance pulls too strongly towards specific examples rather than allowing the diffusion model to explore the latent space.\\n\\n*   **Potential for Positive (but less common) Impacts:**\\n    *   In a *highly diverse* kNN database, and with careful balancing of the kNN influence, it\\'s *theoretically* possible for the model to synthesize novel combinations of features observed in different neighbors, thereby contributing to diversity. However, in practice, the bias towards existing modes often dominates.\\n\\n### 5. Optimizing the Retrieval Strategy for Improved Performance\\n\\nOptimizing the kNN retrieval strategy is crucial for balancing quality and diversity, and for maximizing the benefits of kNN-Diffusion.\\n\\n1.  **Database Content and Size:**\\n    *   **Quality:** Use a clean, high-resolution, and well-curated external dataset. Noise or poor quality in the database directly translates to degradation in generated images.\\n    *   **Diversity:** Ensure the database is as diverse as possible across relevant dimensions (styles, content, lighting, composition) to support a wider range of generations and mitigate mode collapse. A larger database generally allows for more relevant neighbors, but increases retrieval time.\\n    *   **Relevance:** The database should be relevant to the expected generation tasks.\\n\\n2.  **Distance Metric and Feature Space:**\\n    *   **Latent Space Proximity:** The kNN search should occur in a meaningful feature space. kNN-Diffusion typically uses the noisy latent space of the diffusion model itself, as this space is directly relevant to the U-Net\\'s operation.\\n    *   **Beyond L2:** Explore other distance metrics or learned similarity functions that better capture semantic or perceptual similarity (e.g., using features from a pre-trained vision model like CLIP or DINO for initial filtering, or a weighted L2).\\n\\n3.  **Number of Neighbors (k):**\\n    *   **Balancing Act:** `k` is a hyperparameter that directly controls the trade-off.\\n        *   **Small `k`:** Stronger pull from specific examples, potentially leading to higher fidelity if neighbors are perfect, but higher risk of artifacts from irrelevant neighbors and reduced diversity.\\n        *   **Large `k`:** Smoother guidance from an \"average\" of neighbors, potentially more robust to individual bad neighbors, but can dilute unique features and still lead to mode collapse around dense regions.\\n    *   **Dynamic `k`:** Vary `k` based on the noise level or generation step. For example, use a larger `k` at early, high-noise steps for global structure, and a smaller `k` at later, low-noise steps for fine details.\\n\\n4.  **Integration Method (How kNN Influences U-Net):**\\n    *   **Weighting:** Adjust the weighting of the kNN guidance term relative to the U-Net\\'s prediction. A higher weight means stronger guidance from the neighbors, potentially higher fidelity but lower diversity.\\n    *   **Adaptive Weighting:** Make the weighting dynamic based on factors like the distance to the nearest neighbor (closer means higher confidence/weight), or the current noise level.\\n    *   **Beyond Simple Interpolation:** Explore more sophisticated fusion mechanisms, such as using attention, gradient-based guidance, or learning a fusion network.\\n\\n5.  **Retrieval Frequency and Time Steps:**\\n    *   **Per-Step Retrieval:** The standard kNN-Diffusion retrieves neighbors at every denoising step. This is computationally intensive but provides continuous guidance.\\n    *   **Sparse Retrieval:** Experiment with retrieving neighbors only at certain key steps, or less frequently, to reduce computational overhead while still providing some guidance.\\n\\n6.  **Indexing and Search Efficiency:**\\n    *   **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):** Utilize efficient ANN search libraries (e.g., Faiss, HNSW, Annoy) to perform quick searches in large databases. This is critical for practical deployment.\\n\\n7.  **Filtering and Refinement:**\\n    *   **Pre-filtering:** Before using neighbors, apply filters based on additional metadata or semantic similarity checks to discard clearly irrelevant ones.\\n    *   **Neighbor Consensus:** If `k` is large, consider statistical properties of the neighbors (e.g., standard deviation of their predicted clean values) to assess their coherence and adjust guidance strength.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the kNN retrieval mechanism in kNN-Diffusion offers a powerful way to inject real-world knowledge into generative models, significantly boosting realism and fidelity. However, it introduces a strong bias towards the kNN database, posing a considerable challenge to diversity. Optimizing the retrieval strategy involves careful curation of the external dataset, intelligent selection of k, adaptive integration of the kNN signal, and efficient search algorithms, all aimed at finding the sweet spot between high-quality, grounded generations and novel, diverse outputs.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.8829283}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'kNN-Diffusion is a fascinating approach that leverages a nearest-neighbor lookup in a pre-existing image dataset (like LAION-5B or ImageNet) during the diffusion process. This design has distinct implications for semantic alignment, leading to particular strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment:**\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion generally excels at producing **high-fidelity, realistic images** that accurately ground common objects and scenes present in its retrieval database. It struggles, however, with **novel compositions, abstract concepts, precise relational understanding, and subtle semantic nuances** that are not well-represented or derivable from direct nearest neighbors. Its alignment tends to be strong for \"what\" an object is, but weaker for \"how\" it interacts or \"what kind\" of nuanced attribute it possesses, especially for concepts not directly found in the kNN database.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Successful Alignments (Strengths)\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion\\'s strength lies in its ability to retrieve and integrate real-world visual information, leading to:\\n\\n1.  **High Fidelity and Realism:** Because it directly incorporates visual features from real images, the generated outputs often possess a photographic quality and fine-grained detail that can be superior for common objects.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"A majestic golden retriever playing fetch in a sunlit park.\"\\n    *   **Expected Success:** The model would likely generate a highly realistic golden retriever, with accurate fur texture and proportions, in a convincingly rendered park setting with appropriate lighting. The dog would probably be holding or chasing a ball.\\n    *   **Reason for Success:** Both \"golden retriever,\" \"fetch,\" \"park,\" and \"sunlit\" are concepts with abundant, high-quality visual representations in large datasets. The kNN retrieval can pull relevant examples that guide the diffusion process toward realism and detail for these common elements.\\n\\n2.  **Grounding of Common Objects and Scenes:** If a concept is well-represented in the kNN database, the model can accurately depict its visual characteristics.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"The Eiffel Tower at sunset with a few tourists around.\"\\n    *   **Expected Success:** A clearly recognizable Eiffel Tower, accurate proportions, realistic lighting for sunset, and believable figures of tourists.\\n    *   **Reason for Success:** The Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark with countless images. The kNN component can directly inject visual cues for the tower\\'s structure, the lighting of a sunset, and the appearance of tourists, leading to strong semantic alignment for these primary elements.\\n\\n3.  **Capturing Specific Instance Details (if in database):** For very specific, well-documented entities, the retrieval mechanism can aid in accurate representation.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"A red 1965 Ford Mustang parked on a suburban street.\"\\n    *   **Expected Success:** A very accurate depiction of a 1965 Ford Mustang, distinguishable from other car models, in a plausible street environment.\\n    *   **Reason for Success:** If the kNN database contains numerous images of this specific car model, the retrieval step significantly constrains the output towards that correct visual identity, leading to strong alignment with the vehicle type.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Unsuccessful Alignments (Weaknesses)\\n\\nkNN-Diffusion\\'s reliance on retrieval can hinder performance when prompts demand:\\n\\n1.  **Abstract Concepts and Metaphors:** Ideas that don\\'t have a direct, tangible visual equivalent in the database will be difficult to represent accurately.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"The silence screamed in the empty room.\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** The image might show an empty room, perhaps even one that feels silent. However, it\\'s highly unlikely to visually convey \"silence screamed\" in a meaningful or semantically aligned way. The model would struggle to visualize a metaphor.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** \"Silence screaming\" is an abstract, metaphorical concept. There are no direct visual nearest neighbors for this. The model\\'s diffusion process, guided by kNN, lacks the inherent generative capacity for such a conceptual leap without explicit visual training data.\\n\\n2.  **Complex Relational Understanding (Verbs, Prepositions):** While individual objects might be present, the precise spatial or action-based relationships between them can be weak or misinterpreted.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"A cat chasing a mouse under a kitchen table.\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** The image might show a cat, a mouse, and a kitchen table. However, the \"chasing\" action might be static or unclear, and the \"under the table\" relationship might be poorly executed (e.g., mouse next to table, or cat on table).\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** While \"cat,\" \"mouse,\" and \"kitchen table\" are common, the precise dynamics of \"chasing\" and the spatial \"under\" are harder to infer solely from retrieving static images. The kNN component helps ground the objects but doesn\\'t inherently encode complex actions or multi-object spatial relationships unless those exact scenarios are abundant in the database and retrieved precisely.\\n\\n3.  **Precise Counting and Spatial Arrangement:** Generating exact numbers of objects or very specific geometric layouts can be challenging.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"Three red spheres neatly stacked on a blue cube.\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** The image might show red spheres and a blue cube, but the count of \"three\" spheres might be off (e.g., two, four, or a cluster), and the \"neatly stacked\" arrangement might be disorganized or incorrect.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** Counting and precise spatial arrangements require a strong understanding of object instances and geometric transformations, which are difficult to infer from a kNN retrieval that primarily provides visual *features* rather than a scene graph or explicit layout instructions.\\n\\n4.  **Novel Compositions and Out-of-Distribution Concepts:** When the prompt describes something truly unique, fantastic, or a combination not prevalent in the training data/retrieval database, the model can struggle.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"A steampunk griffin delivering pizza on the moon.\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** It might generate elements like a griffin, some steampunk aesthetics, a pizza, and a moon-like background. However, the \"steampunk griffin\" might look generic or like a normal griffin, and the act of \"delivering pizza\" might be absent or just implied, lacking semantic cohesion for the novel concept.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** While individual components like \"griffin,\" \"steampunk,\" \"pizza,\" and \"moon\" might have visual representations, the specific, novel combination of a \"steampunk griffin delivering pizza\" is highly unlikely to have direct nearest neighbors. The kNN system might retrieve disparate parts that are then imperfectly blended by the diffusion process, leading to weak alignment for the overall novel concept.\\n\\n5.  **Subtle Attributes and Emotional Nuances:** Expressing delicate variations or emotions is hard without direct visual examples.\\n    *   **Example Prompt:** \"A subtly melancholic robot contemplating its existence.\"\\n    *   **Expected Failure:** It might generate a robot. \"Contemplating its existence\" is abstract and hard to visualize. \"Subtly melancholic\" is an emotional nuance that is extremely difficult to convey purely through visual form, especially if the kNN retrieval leans towards generic robot poses.\\n    *   **Reason for Failure:** Emotional and highly nuanced attributes often require an understanding of context, body language, or facial expressions that are not easily captured or synthesized purely from retrieving similar-looking objects.\\n\\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\\n\\nTo enhance text-to-image semantic alignment in kNN-Diffusion and similar models:\\n\\n1.  **Prompt-Aware Retrieval:** Instead of just finding nearest image neighbors in embedding space, develop retrieval mechanisms that understand the *intent* of the prompt more deeply. This could involve:\\n    *   **Scene Graph Parsing:** Decompose the prompt into objects, attributes, and relationships (e.g., \"cat\" (object), \"chasing\" (action), \"mouse\" (object), \"under\" (relation), \"table\" (object)). Retrieve images not just for individual components but also for the specified relationships.\\n    *   **Multi-Modal Reasoning:** Integrate additional modalities (e.g., video clips for actions, textual descriptions for abstract concepts) during retrieval to better inform the generation.\\n    *   **Hierarchical Retrieval:** Retrieve at multiple levels of abstraction \u2013 overall scene, main subjects, and then fine-grained details/attributes.\\n\\n2.  **Finer-Grained Control over Integration:** Improve how the retrieved images guide the diffusion process:\\n    *   **Adaptive Blending:** Instead of a fixed influence, allow the model to dynamically decide how much to rely on retrieved images versus its own generative capacity, especially for novel parts of the prompt.\\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Use attention mechanisms to ensure specific parts of the retrieved images influence corresponding parts of the generated image, respecting object boundaries and semantic regions.\\n    *   **Semantic Segmentation Guidance:** Use semantic maps derived from the prompt or retrieved images to guide the placement and rendering of objects and their interactions more accurately.\\n\\n3.  **Enhanced Generative Capacity for Novelty:** While kNN excels at realism, the diffusion model itself needs to be robust enough to \"hallucinate\" or synthesize novel elements when direct retrieval isn\\'t sufficient. This involves:\\n    *   **More Diverse and Conceptually Rich Training Data:** Training the base diffusion model on an even wider array of concepts, including abstract ones, or synthetic data specifically designed to teach relational understanding.\\n    *   **Compositional Learning:** Explicitly training the model to compose disparate elements into coherent scenes, rather than relying solely on nearest neighbors.\\n\\n4.  **Feedback Loops and Reinforcement Learning:** Incorporate human feedback (RLHF) to refine the model\\'s understanding of semantic alignment, particularly for complex or subjective prompts. Users could rate how well images match their intent, guiding the model\\'s future generations.\\n\\n5.  **Hybrid Architectures:** Explore combining kNN-Diffusion with other techniques, such as:\\n    *   **Text-to-3D Integration:** Generate rough 3D scene compositions from prompts, then use kNN-Diffusion to texture and refine the scene.\\n    *   **ControlNet-like Conditioning:** Allow users or an internal module to provide additional spatial or structural guidance (e.g., depth maps, pose estimation) based on prompt understanding.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, kNN-Diffusion and similar retrieval-augmented generative models can move beyond simply depicting \"what is common\" to accurately reflecting the full meaning and intent of highly complex and novel text prompts.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.88201135}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the agent reviews, here's a summary of the paper's strengths and weaknesses:\n\n*   **Image Quality:** The ImageQualityReviewer noted that the generated images often lack crispness and fine detail, with potential artifacts like patchiness and inconsistent textures.\n*   **Retrieval Relevance:** The RetrievalRelevanceAnalyst highlighted the importance of the kNN retrieval mechanism in grounding the generation process in real data, improving realism and fidelity.
