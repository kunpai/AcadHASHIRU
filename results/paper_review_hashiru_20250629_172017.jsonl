The paper title is: Variational Pseudo Labels for Meta Test-time Adaptation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Deep neural networks start to exhibit generalizability problems and suffer from performance degradation as soon as test data distributions differ from the ones experienced during training, (Geirhos et al., 2018; Recht et al., 2019). To deal with the distribution shift, domain adaptation, e.g., (Saenko et al., 2010; Long et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021) and domain generalization, e.g., (Muandet et al., 2013; Motiian et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; 2020) have proven effective tactics. However, these two settings either require a large number of (unlabeled) target data during training or do not consider any target information during generalization at all. Both of which are not necessarily valid assumptions in realistic scenarios. Test-time adaptation, e.g., (Sun et al., 2020; Varsavsky et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) goes beyond these two setting and introduces a new learning paradigm, which trains a model on source data and further optimizes it using the unlabeled target data at test time to adapt to the target domain. One widely applied strategy for test-time adaptation updates model parameters by self-supervision (Liang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Iwasawa & Matsuo, 2021; Niu et al., 2022). However, due to domain shifts, the source-model predictions on the target samples can be uncertain and inaccurate. As self-supervision-based test-time adaptation is often achieved by optimization with pseudo labels or entropy minimization based on the source-trained model predictions, the overconfident in some mispredictions. As a result, the adapted model becomes unreliable and misspecified (Wilson & Izmailov, 2020) to the target data. In this paper we make three contributions. First, we address test-time adaptation in a probabilistic framework by formulating it as a variational inference problem. We define pseudo labels as stochastic variables and estimate a distribution over them by variational inference. By doing so, the uncertainty in source-trained model predictions is incorporated into the adaptation to the target data at test time. Second, thanks to the proposed probabilistic formalism, it is natural and convenient to utilize variational distributions to leverage extra information. By hinging on this benefit, we design the variational pseudo labels to explore the neighboring information of target samples into the inference of the pseudo label distributions. By doing so, the variational pseudo labels are more accurate, which enables the source-trained model to be better specified to target data and therefore conducive to model adaptation. Third, we adopt a meta-learning paradigm for optimization to simulate test-time adaptation on source domains. More specifically, the model is exposed to domain shifts iteratively and optimized to learn the ability of adapting to unseen domains. We conduct experiments on three widely-used benchmarks to demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of our method for test-time adaptation. 2 METHODOLOGY:  2.1 PRELIMINARY: We were given data from different domains defined on the joint space X \u00d7Y , where X and Y denote the data space and label space, respectively. The domains are split into several source domains Ds= { (xs,ys) i }Ns i=1 and target domains Dt= { (xt,yt) i }Nt i=1 . The goal is to train a model on source domains that is expected to generalize well on the (unseen) target domains. To this end, test-time adaptation methods, e.g., (Wang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2022), have recently been proposed. These methods adapt the source-trained model by optimization to target domains at test time. A common strategy in these methods is that the model \u03b8 is first trained on source data Ds by minimizing a supervised loss Ltrain(\u03b8)=E(xs,ys)i\u2208Ds [LCE(xs,ys;\u03b8)]; and then at test time they adapt the model \u03b8s to the target domain by optimization with certain surrogate losses, e.g., entropy minimization, based on unlabeled test data, which is formulated as: Ltest(\u03b8) = Ext\u2208Dt [LE(xt;\u03b8s)], (1) where the entropy is calculated on the source model predictions. However, test samples from the target domain could be largely misclassified by the source model due to the domain shift, resulting in large uncertainty in the predictions. Moreover, the entropy minimization tends to update the model with high confidence even for the wrong predictions, which would cause a misspecified model for the target domain. To solve those problems, in this work we address test-time model adaptation from a probabilistic perspective. We propose a probabilistic inference framework that models the uncertainty of the source-model predictions by defining distributions over pseudo labels. Moreover, under the probabilistic formalism, we propose designing variational pseudo labels, which enables the model to incorporate the neighboring information in test samples to combat domain shifts. We adopt a metalearning paradigm for optimization, which simulates the domain shifts and adaptation procedure. By doing so, the model learns to acquire the ability to further adapt itself with pseudo labels to unseen target domains. We provide a graphical illustration to highlight the differences between common test-time adaptation and our proposals in Figure 1. 2.2 PROBABILISTIC TEST-TIME ADAPTATION WITH LATENT PSEUDO LABELS: We first provide a probabilistic formulation for test-time adaptation based on pseudo labels. Given the target sample xt and the source-trained model \u03b8s, we would like to make predictions on the target sample. To this end, we formulate the predictive likelihood as follows: p(yt|xt,\u03b8s) = \u222b p(yt|xt,\u03b8t)p(\u03b8t|xt,\u03b8s)d\u03b8t \u2248 p(yt|xt,\u03b8\u2217t ), (2) where we use the value \u03b8\u2217t obtained by the maximum a posterior (MAP) to approximate the integration (Finn et al., 2018). Intuitively, the MAP approximation is interpreted as inferring the posterior over \u03b8t: p(\u03b8t|xt,\u03b8s) \u2248 \u03b4(\u03b8t = \u03b8\u2217t ), which we obtain by adapting \u03b8s using the target data xt. To model the uncertainty of predictions for more robust test-time adaptation, we treat pseudo labels as stochastic variables in the probabilistic framework as shown in Figure 1 (b). The pseudo labels are obtained from the source model predictions, which follows categorical distributions. Then we reformulate eq. (2) as follows: p(yt|xt,\u03b8s) = \u222b p(yt|xt,\u03b8t) [ \u222b p(\u03b8t|y\u0302t,xt,\u03b8s)p(y\u0302t|xt,\u03b8s)dy\u0302t ] d\u03b8t \u2248 Ep(y\u0302t|xt,\u03b8s)[p(yt|xt,\u03b8 \u2217 t )], (3) where \u03b8\u2217t is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t|y\u0302t,xt,\u03b8s), which is obtained via gradient descent on the data xt and the corresponding pseudo labels y\u0302t starting from \u03b8s. The formulation allows us to sample different pseudo labels from the categorical distribution p(y\u0302t) to adapt the model \u03b8\u2217t , which takes into account the uncertainty of predictions by the source-trained model. By approximating the expectation of p(y\u0302t) with the argmax function on p(y\u0302t), \u03b8\u2217t is obtained by gradient descent based on only a point estimation of the pseudo label p(y\u0302t). However, due to domain shifts, the argmax value of p(y\u0302t) is not guaranteed to be always correct. The adaptation then is similar to entropy minimization (eq. 1), where the adapted model can achieve high confidence but wrong predictions of some target samples due to domain shifts. For example, consider a toy binary classification task, where the predicted probability is [0.4, 0.6] with the ground-truth label [1, 0]. The pseudo label generated by selecting the maximum probability is [0, 1], which is inaccurate. Optimization based on these labels would give rise to a model misspecified to target data, failing to adapt to the target domain. In contrast, our probabilistic formulation allows us to sample pseudo labels from the categorical distribution p(y\u0302t|xt,\u03b8s), which incorporates the uncertainty of the pseudo label y\u0302t in a principled way. Again using the above example, the pseudo label sampled from the predicted distribution has a probability of 40% to be the ground-truth label, which leads to the adaptation of the model in the correct direction. Therefore, our formulation achieves better adaptation by accessing accurate pseudo labels from the inaccurate prediction distributions. 2.3 VARIATIONAL PSEUDO LABELS: Under the probabilistic formalism, we derive variational inference of pseudo labels. To train the ability of the model to generate better variational pseudo labels and to fully utilize the pseudo label distributions for better adaptation, we adopt the meta-learning paradigm to simulate domain shifts and test-time adaptation procedures (Finn et al., 2017; Dou et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2022). We split the source domains Ds into meta-source domains Ds\u2032 and a meta-target domain Dt\u2032 during training. The meta-target domain is selected randomly in each iteration to mimic diverse domain shifts. To simulate the test-time adaptation and estimation procedure, we maximize the log-likelihood of the meta-target samples after model adaptation on the meta-target data: log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032) = log \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8t\u2032) [ \u222b p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032 ] d\u03b8t\u2032 \u2248 log \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2217t\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032 \u2265 Ep(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 )[log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8 \u2217 t\u2032)], (4) where p(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032) denotes the distribution of pseudo labels generated by the meta-source model \u03b8s\u2032 on the meta-target data xt\u2032 . \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032) similar to eq. (3), which is learned to mimic the test-time adaptation procedure. Under the meta-learning setting, the actual labels yt\u2032 of the meta-target data is accessible since source data are fully labeled as shown in Figure 1 (c). We then simulate the test evaluation procedure and further supervise the adapted model \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 on its meta-target predictions by the actual labels. The maximization of the log-likelihood of p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2217t\u2032) is realised by a cross-entropy loss on the meta-target predictions and the actual meta-target labels. Intuitively, the pseudo-label adapted model is supervised to achieve good performance on the adapted data. Thus, it learns the ability to generate better pseudo labels and achieve better adaptation across domain shifts with these pseudo labels on new unseen domains. Variational pseudo labels. Moreover, we also propose variational pseudo labels that incorporate information of the neighboring target samples to estimate pseudo label distributions that are more robust against domain shifts. The variational pseudo labels is natural and convenient to deployed under the probabilistic formulation. Assume that we have a batch of meta-target data Xt\u2032= { xit\u2032 }M i=1 , we reformulate eq. (4) as: log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) = log \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8t\u2032) [ \u222b \u222b p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032dwt\u2032 ] d\u03b8t\u2032 = log \u222b \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2217t\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032dwt\u2032d\u03b8t\u2032 , (5) where \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032). We introduce the latent variable wt\u2032 to integrate the information of the neighboring target samples Xt\u2032 as shown in Figure 1. To approximate the true posterior of the joint distribution p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032), we introduce a variational posterior q(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032), where Yt\u2032= { yit\u2032 }M i=1 denotes the actual labels of the metatarget data Xt\u2032 . To facilitate the estimation of pseudo labels, we set the prior distribution as: p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) = p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032)p\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) (6) where p\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) is generated by the features of Xt\u2032 together with their output values based on \u03b8s\u2032 . Similarly, we define the variational posterior distribution as: q(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032)=p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032)q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032). (7) where q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032) is obtained by the features of Xt\u2032 and the actual labels Yt\u2032based on \u03b8s\u2032 . By introducing eqs. (6) and (7) into (5), we derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the loglikelihood in eq. (5) as follows: log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) \u2265 Eq\u03d5(wt\u2032 )Ep(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032 )[log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8 \u2217 t\u2032)] \u2212DKL[q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032)||p\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032)]. (8) Rather than directly using the meta-source model \u03b8s\u2032 , we estimate the pseudo labels yt\u2032 from the latent variable wt\u2032 , which integrates the features of neighboring target samples. By considering the actual labels Yt\u2032 , the variational distribution utilizes both the target information and categorical information of the neighboring samples. Thus, the variational posterior models the distribution of different categories in the target domain more reliably and produces more accurate pseudo labels to improve model adaptation. 2.4 META TEST-TIME ADAPTATION: TRAINING AND INFERENCE: To mimic domain shifts during training, we split each iteration into meta-source, meta-adaptation, and meta-target to simulate the training stage on source domains, test-time adaptation, and test stage on target data, respectively. Under the meta-learning paradigm, the model is iteratively exposed to domain shifts and learns the capability to adapt the meta-source model \u03b8s\u2032 to meta-target MAP \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 with the variational pseudo labels. The parameters in the variational inference model \u03d5 are jointly optimized in order to generate better pseudo labels against domain shifts. Meta-source. We first train and optimize the model on meta-source domains by minimizing the supervised loss: \u03b8s\u2032 = min \u03b8 E(xs\u2032 ,ys\u2032 ))\u2208Ds\u2032 [LCE(xs\u2032 ,ys\u2032 ;\u03b8)], (9) where (xs\u2032 ,ys\u2032) denotes the input-label pairs of samples on meta-source domains. \u03b8s\u2032 are the model parameters trained on the meta-source data. Meta-adaptation. Once the meta-source-trained model \u03b8s\u2032 is obtained, we generate the pseudo labels p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ) of the meta-target data with the variational posterior q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032). The test-time adaptation procedure is simulated by obtaining \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 : \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 = \u03b8s\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb1\u2207\u03b8LCE(xt\u2032 , y\u0302t\u2032 ;\u03b8s\u2032) y\u0302t\u2032 \u223c p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032), (10) where \u03bb1 denotes the learning rate of the optimization in the meta-adaptation stage. Meta-target. Since our final goal is to obtain good performance on the target data after optimization with pseudo labels, we further mimic the test-time inference on the meta-target domain and supervise the meta-target prediction on \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 by maximizing the log-likelihood, which is equal to minimizing: Lmeta = E(xt\u2032 ,yt\u2032 )\u2208Dt\u2032 [Eq\u03d5(wt\u2032 )Ep(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032 )LCE(xt\u2032 ,yt\u2032 ;\u03b8 \u2217 t\u2032)]+DKL[q\u03d5(wt\u2032)||p\u03d5(wt\u2032)], (11) where yt\u2032 denotes the ground truth label of xt\u2032 . The parameters \u03b8 are finally updated by \u03b8 = \u03b8s\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb2\u2207\u03b8Lmeta, (12) where \u03bb2 denotes the learning rate for the meta-target stage. Note that the loss in eq. (11) is computed on the parameters \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 obtained by eq. (10), while the optimization is performed over the meta-sourcetrained parameters \u03b8s\u2032 in eq. (12). Intuitively, the parameters are optimized to learn the ability to handle domain shifts, such that adaptation with variational pseudo labels of data from new domains improves the predictions on the new domain. The parameters in the variational inference model \u03d5 are jointly trained with \u03b8. To guarantee that the variational pseudo labels do extract the neighboring information for discrimination, we add a cross-entropy loss Lc\u0302e on the variational pseudo labels and the corresponding actual labels during training. Thus, \u03d5 is updated by: \u03d5 = \u03d5\u2212 \u03bb3(\u2207\u03d5Lc\u0302e \u2212\u2207\u03d5Lmeta), (13) where \u03bb3 denotes the learning rates. Test-time adaptation and prediction. At test time, the model trained on the source domains with the above meta-learning strategy \u03b8s is adapted by further optimization using eq. (10). The adapted model is then evaluated on the (unseen) target data Dt. The prediction is formulated as: p(yt|xt,\u03b8s,Xt) = \u222b p(yt|xt,\u03b8t) [ \u222b p(\u03b8t|y\u0302t,xt,\u03b8s)p(y\u0302t,wt|xt,\u03b8s,Xt)dy\u0302tdwt ] d\u03b8t = Ep\u03d5(wt)Ep(y\u0302t|wt,xt)[log p(yt|xt,\u03b8 \u2217 t )], (14) where \u03b8\u2217t is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t|xt, y\u0302t,\u03b8s). p\u03d5(wt)=p\u03d5(wt|\u03b8s,Xt) is generated by the features of Xt according to the outputs or common pseudo labels based on \u03b8s. 3 RELATED WORK: Test-time adaptation. By combining the advantages of both domain adaptation (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Long et al., 2015; Hoffman et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2020; Tzeng et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2022) and domain generalization (Muandet et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; 2019; Du et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; 2022), test-time adaptation (Sun et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Zhou & Levine, 2021; Chen et al., 2022) and source-free adaptation (Liang et al., 2020; Eastwood et al., 2021) are proposed to train a model only on source domains while adapting it to unlabeled target data at test time. Several methods update normalization statistics of the model to handle domain shifts (Schneider et al., 2020; Du et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021). Sun et al. (2020) proposed to fine-tune the model parameters by a self-supervised loss at test time. Liu et al. (2021) further enhanced the method by introducing a test-time feature alignment strategy. Instead of using an extra self-supervised loss, Wang et al. (2021) proposed fully test-time adaptation by entropy minimization, which is followed in several recent works (Zhang et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2022; Jang & Chung, 2022). Zhang et al. (2021) minimized the entropy of the marginal output distribution averaged over multiple augmentations of a single target sample. Niu et al. (2022) proposed an efficient test-time adaptation method without forgetting by adapting with low entropy samples with Fisher regularization. Different from these methods, Iwasawa & Matsuo (2021) tried to adjust the classifier with pseudo labels of the target data, without fine-tuning the model parameters. Different from these methods, we propose a probabilistic formulation of test-time adaptation, which models the uncertainty of pseudo labels for better adaptation. We also introduce variational pseudo labels with meta-adaptation to further learn the ability to improve the pseudo labels and adaptations. Meta-learning. Meta-learning-based methods (Alet et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2022) have been studied for test-time adaptation before. Alet et al. (2021) learned to adapt with a contrastive loss. Goyal et al. (2022) meta-learned the loss functions of the test-time adaptation for better adaptation. Xiao et al. (2022) proposed a single sample generalization, which adapts the model to each individual target sample through mimicking domain shifts during training. Our method also learns the adaptation ability under the meta-learning setting. We design meta-adaptation to simulate the test-time adaptation procedure and supervise it based on our probabilistic formulation. We further supervise the meta-adapted model in the meta-target stage to learn the variational pseudo label generation and adaptation ability. Pseudo label learning. In pseudo label learning, the motive is to use a model\u2019s best predictions, e.g., high confidence predictions, and use the corresponding samples and their predictions for retraining the model on a given downstream task. Tasks examples include classification (Yalniz et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020), segmentation (Zou et al., 2020), and object detection (Li et al., 2022). Pham et al. (2021) addresses the problem of confirmation bias in pseudo labeling and utilize a teacher-student network for the task of image classification. For domain generalization and offline adaptation, Abdo et al. (2009) utilize pseudo labels from network extracting features and depth features. For online adaptation, Chen et al. (2022) utilize a contrastive method and utilize pseudo labels to ensure that same class negative samples are not used in contrastive loss optimization. For semi-supervised domain generalization. Zhou et al. (2021) utilize pseudo labels and use confidence as a criteria. In contrast to existing works, our method uses meta learning and is probabilistic in nature for test-time adaptation. 4 EXPERIMENTS:  4.1 SETTINGS: Three datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on image classification and domain generalization settings. We evaluate our method on three widely used datasets in domain generalization. PACS (Li et al., 2017) consists of 7 classes and 4 domains: Photo, Art painting, Cartoon, and Sketch with 9991 samples. We follow the training and validation split in (Li et al., 2017) and evaluate the model according to the \u201cleave-one-out\u201d protocol (Li et al., 2019; Carlucci et al., 2019). We also evaluate our method on the Rotated MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets following Piratla et al. (2020), where the images are rotated by different angles as different domains. We use the subsets with rotation angles from 15\u25e6 to 75\u25e6 in intervals of 15\u25e6 as five source domains, and images rotated by 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 as the target domains. Two adaptation settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate on both offline and online test-time adaptation settings. Offline test-time adaptation assumes there are already unlabeled target data available for adaptation. To be close to real-world application where it is difficult to access the whole target set, we use different amounts of target data for offline adapta- tion. We adapt the model on the available target data and evaluate it on the entire target set without continuously fine-tuning on the entire target set. We also evaluate our method for online test-time adaptation (Iwasawa & Matsuo, 2021). In real-world application, as aforementioned, instead of accessing the entire target set, we usually obtain unlabeled target data in an online manner. To achieve continuous adaptation and improvement of the model on target data, we increment the target data iteratively and keep adapting and evaluating the model on the online target data. Implementation details We make use of ResNet-18 for all our experiments and ablation studies and report the accuracies on ResNet-50 for comparison as well. The backbones are pretrained on ImageNet same as the previous methods. During training, we use a varied learning rate throughout the model. We set the learning rate for the pretrained ResNet to 5e-5 and the learning rate of the variational module and classifiers as 1e-4 for all datasets. During test-time adaptation, we utilize a learning rate of 1e-4 for all layers. 4.2 ABLATION STUDIES: Benefits of our probabilistic test-time adaptation We first investigate the effectiveness of our probabilistic formulation of test-time adaptation and its meta-learned variational pseudo labels. To demonstrate the benefits of the probabilistic formulation, we conduct test-time adaptation with eq. (3) and compare it with a common test-time adaptation tactic (Wang et al., 2021), as in eq. (1). As shown in Table 1, both adaptation with and without probabilistic formulation achieve good improvements over the ERM baseline. Our probabilistic test-time adaptation performs better than the common one on most target domains for both the online and offline adaptation settings, which demonstrates the benefits of modeling uncertainty during adaptation at test time. Moreover, we incorporate the distribution of pseudo labels into the probabilistic formulation, and further propose the variational pseudo labels with meta-adaptation based on the pseudo label distributions. As shown in the fourth and last row in Table 1, our method further improves the performance of both online and offline adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the variational pseudo labels with meta-adaptation. With the probabilistic formulation, it is natural and simple to define the problem as a variational inference problem and solve the problem under the meta-learning framework. The results further demonstrate the benefits and importance of our probabilistic formulations of test-time adaptation. Benefits of variational pseudo-labels Based on the probabilistic formulation, we introduce variational pseudo labels to incorporate the target information of the neighboring target data for each target sample. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our variational pseudo label, we compare it with the normal pseudo labels drawn directly from the prediction distributions of source-trained models. We evaluate the methods in offline adaptation settings with different amounts of target data. As shown in Figure 2 (left), adaptation with our variational pseudo labels achieves better overall results than the normal pseudo labels consistently. We also provide the adaptation results along with adaptation steps in Figure 2 (right). Starting from the same baseline accuracy, the variational pseudo labels achieve faster adaptation than the normal pseudo labels. Adaptation with variational pseudo labels is less prone to saturating in performance, leading to better final accuracy. Offline adaptation with less target data In real applications, it is difficult to access the entire target set at once for adaptation. Therefore, we estimate our method under the offline test-time adaptation settings with different amounts of target data. As shown in Figure 3, the accuracy increases obviously with small numbers of target samples, e.g., 10% and 25%. However, the overall accuracy tends to saturate when keeping increasing the number of target data for adaptation. This indicates that our method is able to achieve good adaptation under the offline adaptation setting with even small amounts of target data, showing the applicability of the proposed method in practice. 4.3 COMPARISONS: To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare our method with some state-ofthe-art test-time adaptation methods in both online and offline adaptation settings. We also compare our method with some domain generalization methods. Table 2 shows the results on PACS based on both ResNet-18 and ResNet-50. Compared with the other state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, our method performs better in both online and offline adaptation settings, especially based on the ResNet-18 backbone. We also conduct experiments on rotated MNIST and rotated Fashion-MNIST for comparison as shown in Table 3. We follow the settings in Piratla et al. (2020) and use ResNet-18 as the backbone. The conclusion is similar to that in PACS. Our method achieves better performance than both the non-adaptive domain generalization methods and adaptation methods. 5 CONCLUSION: We propose to cast test-time adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem and model pseudolabels as distributions in the formulation. By modeling the uncertainty into the pseudo label distributions, the probabilistic formulation mitigates adaptation with inaccurate pseudo labels or predictions, which arises due to domain shifts and lead to misspecified models after adaptation. Based on the probabilistic formulation, we further propose variational pseudo labels under the meta-adaptation paradigm, which exposes the model to domain shifts and learns the ability to adapt with pseudo labels incorporating target information of the neighboring target samples.

The paper title is: Variational Pseudo Labels for Meta Test-time Adaptation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Deep neural networks start to exhibit generalizability problems and suffer from performance degradation as soon as test data distributions differ from the ones experienced during training, (Geirhos et al., 2018; Recht et al., 2019). To deal with the distribution shift, domain adaptation, e.g., (Saenko et al., 2010; Long et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021) and domain generalization, e.g., (Muandet et al., 2013; Motiian et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; 2020) have proven effective tactics. However, these two settings either require a large number of (unlabeled) target data during training or do not consider any target information during generalization at all. Both of which are not necessarily valid assumptions in realistic scenarios. Test-time adaptation, e.g., (Sun et al., 2020; Varsavsky et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) goes beyond these two setting and introduces a new learning paradigm, which trains a model on source data and further optimizes it using the unlabeled target data at test time to adapt to the target domain. One widely applied strategy for test-time adaptation updates model parameters by self-supervision (Liang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Iwasawa & Matsuo, 2021; Niu et al., 2022). However, due to domain shifts, the source-model predictions on the target samples can be uncertain and inaccurate. As self-supervision-based test-time adaptation is often achieved by optimization with pseudo labels or entropy minimization based on the source-trained model predictions, the overconfident in some mispredictions. As a result, the adapted model becomes unreliable and misspecified (Wilson & Izmailov, 2020) to the target data. In this paper we make three contributions. First, we address test-time adaptation in a probabilistic framework by formulating it as a variational inference problem. We define pseudo labels as stochastic variables and estimate a distribution over them by variational inference. By doing so, the uncertainty in source-trained model predictions is incorporated into the adaptation to the target data at test time. Second, thanks to the proposed probabilistic formalism, it is natural and convenient to utilize variational distributions to leverage extra information. By hinging on this benefit, we design the variational pseudo labels to explore the neighboring information of target samples into the inference of the pseudo label distributions. By doing so, the variational pseudo labels are more accurate, which enables the source-trained model to be better specified to target data and therefore conducive to model adaptation. Third, we adopt a meta-learning paradigm for optimization to simulate test-time adaptation on source domains. More specifically, the model is exposed to domain shifts iteratively and optimized to learn the ability of adapting to unseen domains. We conduct experiments on three widely-used benchmarks to demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of our method for test-time adaptation. 2 METHODOLOGY:  2.1 PRELIMINARY: We were given data from different domains defined on the joint space X \u00d7Y , where X and Y denote the data space and label space, respectively. The domains are split into several source domains Ds= { (xs,ys) i }Ns i=1 and target domains Dt= { (xt,yt) i }Nt i=1 . The goal is to train a model on source domains that is expected to generalize well on the (unseen) target domains. To this end, test-time adaptation methods, e.g., (Wang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2022), have recently been proposed. These methods adapt the source-trained model by optimization to target domains at test time. A common strategy in these methods is that the model \u03b8 is first trained on source data Ds by minimizing a supervised loss Ltrain(\u03b8)=E(xs,ys)i\u2208Ds [LCE(xs,ys;\u03b8)]; and then at test time they adapt the model \u03b8s to the target domain by optimization with certain surrogate losses, e.g., entropy minimization, based on unlabeled test data, which is formulated as: Ltest(\u03b8) = Ext\u2208Dt [LE(xt;\u03b8s)], (1) where the entropy is calculated on the source model predictions. However, test samples from the target domain could be largely misclassified by the source model due to the domain shift, resulting in large uncertainty in the predictions. Moreover, the entropy minimization tends to update the model with high confidence even for the wrong predictions, which would cause a misspecified model for the target domain. To solve those problems, in this work we address test-time model adaptation from a probabilistic perspective. We propose a probabilistic inference framework that models the uncertainty of the source-model predictions by defining distributions over pseudo labels. Moreover, under the probabilistic formalism, we propose designing variational pseudo labels, which enables the model to incorporate the neighboring information in test samples to combat domain shifts. We adopt a metalearning paradigm for optimization, which simulates the domain shifts and adaptation procedure. By doing so, the model learns to acquire the ability to further adapt itself with pseudo labels to unseen target domains. We provide a graphical illustration to highlight the differences between common test-time adaptation and our proposals in Figure 1. 2.2 PROBABILISTIC TEST-TIME ADAPTATION WITH LATENT PSEUDO LABELS: We first provide a probabilistic formulation for test-time adaptation based on pseudo labels. Given the target sample xt and the source-trained model \u03b8s, we would like to make predictions on the target sample. To this end, we formulate the predictive likelihood as follows: p(yt|xt,\u03b8s) = \u222b p(yt|xt,\u03b8t)p(\u03b8t|xt,\u03b8s)d\u03b8t \u2248 p(yt|xt,\u03b8\u2217t ), (2) where we use the value \u03b8\u2217t obtained by the maximum a posterior (MAP) to approximate the integration (Finn et al., 2018). Intuitively, the MAP approximation is interpreted as inferring the posterior over \u03b8t: p(\u03b8t|xt,\u03b8s) \u2248 \u03b4(\u03b8t = \u03b8\u2217t ), which we obtain by adapting \u03b8s using the target data xt. To model the uncertainty of predictions for more robust test-time adaptation, we treat pseudo labels as stochastic variables in the probabilistic framework as shown in Figure 1 (b). The pseudo labels are obtained from the source model predictions, which follows categorical distributions. Then we reformulate eq. (2) as follows: p(yt|xt,\u03b8s) = \u222b p(yt|xt,\u03b8t) [ \u222b p(\u03b8t|y\u0302t,xt,\u03b8s)p(y\u0302t|xt,\u03b8s)dy\u0302t ] d\u03b8t \u2248 Ep(y\u0302t|xt,\u03b8s)[p(yt|xt,\u03b8 \u2217 t )], (3) where \u03b8\u2217t is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t|y\u0302t,xt,\u03b8s), which is obtained via gradient descent on the data xt and the corresponding pseudo labels y\u0302t starting from \u03b8s. The formulation allows us to sample different pseudo labels from the categorical distribution p(y\u0302t) to adapt the model \u03b8\u2217t , which takes into account the uncertainty of predictions by the source-trained model. By approximating the expectation of p(y\u0302t) with the argmax function on p(y\u0302t), \u03b8\u2217t is obtained by gradient descent based on only a point estimation of the pseudo label p(y\u0302t). However, due to domain shifts, the argmax value of p(y\u0302t) is not guaranteed to be always correct. The adaptation then is similar to entropy minimization (eq. 1), where the adapted model can achieve high confidence but wrong predictions of some target samples due to domain shifts. For example, consider a toy binary classification task, where the predicted probability is [0.4, 0.6] with the ground-truth label [1, 0]. The pseudo label generated by selecting the maximum probability is [0, 1], which is inaccurate. Optimization based on these labels would give rise to a model misspecified to target data, failing to adapt to the target domain. In contrast, our probabilistic formulation allows us to sample pseudo labels from the categorical distribution p(y\u0302t|xt,\u03b8s), which incorporates the uncertainty of the pseudo label y\u0302t in a principled way. Again using the above example, the pseudo label sampled from the predicted distribution has a probability of 40% to be the ground-truth label, which leads to the adaptation of the model in the correct direction. Therefore, our formulation achieves better adaptation by accessing accurate pseudo labels from the inaccurate prediction distributions. 2.3 VARIATIONAL PSEUDO LABELS: Under the probabilistic formalism, we derive variational inference of pseudo labels. To train the ability of the model to generate better variational pseudo labels and to fully utilize the pseudo label distributions for better adaptation, we adopt the meta-learning paradigm to simulate domain shifts and test-time adaptation procedures (Finn et al., 2017; Dou et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2022). We split the source domains Ds into meta-source domains Ds\u2032 and a meta-target domain Dt\u2032 during training. The meta-target domain is selected randomly in each iteration to mimic diverse domain shifts. To simulate the test-time adaptation and estimation procedure, we maximize the log-likelihood of the meta-target samples after model adaptation on the meta-target data: log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032) = log \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8t\u2032) [ \u222b p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032 ] d\u03b8t\u2032 \u2248 log \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2217t\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032 \u2265 Ep(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 )[log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8 \u2217 t\u2032)], (4) where p(y\u0302t\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032) denotes the distribution of pseudo labels generated by the meta-source model \u03b8s\u2032 on the meta-target data xt\u2032 . \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032) similar to eq. (3), which is learned to mimic the test-time adaptation procedure. Under the meta-learning setting, the actual labels yt\u2032 of the meta-target data is accessible since source data are fully labeled as shown in Figure 1 (c). We then simulate the test evaluation procedure and further supervise the adapted model \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 on its meta-target predictions by the actual labels. The maximization of the log-likelihood of p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2217t\u2032) is realised by a cross-entropy loss on the meta-target predictions and the actual meta-target labels. Intuitively, the pseudo-label adapted model is supervised to achieve good performance on the adapted data. Thus, it learns the ability to generate better pseudo labels and achieve better adaptation across domain shifts with these pseudo labels on new unseen domains. Variational pseudo labels. Moreover, we also propose variational pseudo labels that incorporate information of the neighboring target samples to estimate pseudo label distributions that are more robust against domain shifts. The variational pseudo labels is natural and convenient to deployed under the probabilistic formulation. Assume that we have a batch of meta-target data Xt\u2032= { xit\u2032 }M i=1 , we reformulate eq. (4) as: log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) = log \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8t\u2032) [ \u222b \u222b p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032dwt\u2032 ] d\u03b8t\u2032 = log \u222b \u222b p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2217t\u2032)p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032)dy\u0302t\u2032dwt\u2032d\u03b8t\u2032 , (5) where \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t\u2032 |y\u0302t\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032). We introduce the latent variable wt\u2032 to integrate the information of the neighboring target samples Xt\u2032 as shown in Figure 1. To approximate the true posterior of the joint distribution p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032), we introduce a variational posterior q(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032), where Yt\u2032= { yit\u2032 }M i=1 denotes the actual labels of the metatarget data Xt\u2032 . To facilitate the estimation of pseudo labels, we set the prior distribution as: p(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) = p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032)p\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) (6) where p\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) is generated by the features of Xt\u2032 together with their output values based on \u03b8s\u2032 . Similarly, we define the variational posterior distribution as: q(y\u0302t\u2032 ,wt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032)=p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032)q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032). (7) where q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032) is obtained by the features of Xt\u2032 and the actual labels Yt\u2032based on \u03b8s\u2032 . By introducing eqs. (6) and (7) into (5), we derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the loglikelihood in eq. (5) as follows: log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032) \u2265 Eq\u03d5(wt\u2032 )Ep(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032 )[log p(yt\u2032 |xt\u2032 ,\u03b8 \u2217 t\u2032)] \u2212DKL[q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032)||p\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032)]. (8) Rather than directly using the meta-source model \u03b8s\u2032 , we estimate the pseudo labels yt\u2032 from the latent variable wt\u2032 , which integrates the features of neighboring target samples. By considering the actual labels Yt\u2032 , the variational distribution utilizes both the target information and categorical information of the neighboring samples. Thus, the variational posterior models the distribution of different categories in the target domain more reliably and produces more accurate pseudo labels to improve model adaptation. 2.4 META TEST-TIME ADAPTATION: TRAINING AND INFERENCE: To mimic domain shifts during training, we split each iteration into meta-source, meta-adaptation, and meta-target to simulate the training stage on source domains, test-time adaptation, and test stage on target data, respectively. Under the meta-learning paradigm, the model is iteratively exposed to domain shifts and learns the capability to adapt the meta-source model \u03b8s\u2032 to meta-target MAP \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 with the variational pseudo labels. The parameters in the variational inference model \u03d5 are jointly optimized in order to generate better pseudo labels against domain shifts. Meta-source. We first train and optimize the model on meta-source domains by minimizing the supervised loss: \u03b8s\u2032 = min \u03b8 E(xs\u2032 ,ys\u2032 ))\u2208Ds\u2032 [LCE(xs\u2032 ,ys\u2032 ;\u03b8)], (9) where (xs\u2032 ,ys\u2032) denotes the input-label pairs of samples on meta-source domains. \u03b8s\u2032 are the model parameters trained on the meta-source data. Meta-adaptation. Once the meta-source-trained model \u03b8s\u2032 is obtained, we generate the pseudo labels p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032 ) of the meta-target data with the variational posterior q\u03d5(wt\u2032 |\u03b8s\u2032 ,Xt\u2032 ,Yt\u2032). The test-time adaptation procedure is simulated by obtaining \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 : \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 = \u03b8s\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb1\u2207\u03b8LCE(xt\u2032 , y\u0302t\u2032 ;\u03b8s\u2032) y\u0302t\u2032 \u223c p(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032), (10) where \u03bb1 denotes the learning rate of the optimization in the meta-adaptation stage. Meta-target. Since our final goal is to obtain good performance on the target data after optimization with pseudo labels, we further mimic the test-time inference on the meta-target domain and supervise the meta-target prediction on \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 by maximizing the log-likelihood, which is equal to minimizing: Lmeta = E(xt\u2032 ,yt\u2032 )\u2208Dt\u2032 [Eq\u03d5(wt\u2032 )Ep(y\u0302t\u2032 |wt\u2032 ,xt\u2032 )LCE(xt\u2032 ,yt\u2032 ;\u03b8 \u2217 t\u2032)]+DKL[q\u03d5(wt\u2032)||p\u03d5(wt\u2032)], (11) where yt\u2032 denotes the ground truth label of xt\u2032 . The parameters \u03b8 are finally updated by \u03b8 = \u03b8s\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb2\u2207\u03b8Lmeta, (12) where \u03bb2 denotes the learning rate for the meta-target stage. Note that the loss in eq. (11) is computed on the parameters \u03b8\u2217t\u2032 obtained by eq. (10), while the optimization is performed over the meta-sourcetrained parameters \u03b8s\u2032 in eq. (12). Intuitively, the parameters are optimized to learn the ability to handle domain shifts, such that adaptation with variational pseudo labels of data from new domains improves the predictions on the new domain. The parameters in the variational inference model \u03d5 are jointly trained with \u03b8. To guarantee that the variational pseudo labels do extract the neighboring information for discrimination, we add a cross-entropy loss Lc\u0302e on the variational pseudo labels and the corresponding actual labels during training. Thus, \u03d5 is updated by: \u03d5 = \u03d5\u2212 \u03bb3(\u2207\u03d5Lc\u0302e \u2212\u2207\u03d5Lmeta), (13) where \u03bb3 denotes the learning rates. Test-time adaptation and prediction. At test time, the model trained on the source domains with the above meta-learning strategy \u03b8s is adapted by further optimization using eq. (10). The adapted model is then evaluated on the (unseen) target data Dt. The prediction is formulated as: p(yt|xt,\u03b8s,Xt) = \u222b p(yt|xt,\u03b8t) [ \u222b p(\u03b8t|y\u0302t,xt,\u03b8s)p(y\u0302t,wt|xt,\u03b8s,Xt)dy\u0302tdwt ] d\u03b8t = Ep\u03d5(wt)Ep(y\u0302t|wt,xt)[log p(yt|xt,\u03b8 \u2217 t )], (14) where \u03b8\u2217t is the MAP value of p(\u03b8t|xt, y\u0302t,\u03b8s). p\u03d5(wt)=p\u03d5(wt|\u03b8s,Xt) is generated by the features of Xt according to the outputs or common pseudo labels based on \u03b8s. 3 RELATED WORK: Test-time adaptation. By combining the advantages of both domain adaptation (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Long et al., 2015; Hoffman et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2020; Tzeng et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2022) and domain generalization (Muandet et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; 2019; Du et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; 2022), test-time adaptation (Sun et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Zhou & Levine, 2021; Chen et al., 2022) and source-free adaptation (Liang et al., 2020; Eastwood et al., 2021) are proposed to train a model only on source domains while adapting it to unlabeled target data at test time. Several methods update normalization statistics of the model to handle domain shifts (Schneider et al., 2020; Du et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021). Sun et al. (2020) proposed to fine-tune the model parameters by a self-supervised loss at test time. Liu et al. (2021) further enhanced the method by introducing a test-time feature alignment strategy. Instead of using an extra self-supervised loss, Wang et al. (2021) proposed fully test-time adaptation by entropy minimization, which is followed in several recent works (Zhang et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2022; Jang & Chung, 2022). Zhang et al. (2021) minimized the entropy of the marginal output distribution averaged over multiple augmentations of a single target sample. Niu et al. (2022) proposed an efficient test-time adaptation method without forgetting by adapting with low entropy samples with Fisher regularization. Different from these methods, Iwasawa & Matsuo (2021) tried to adjust the classifier with pseudo labels of the target data, without fine-tuning the model parameters. Different from these methods, we propose a probabilistic formulation of test-time adaptation, which models the uncertainty of pseudo labels for better adaptation. We also introduce variational pseudo labels with meta-adaptation to further learn the ability to improve the pseudo labels and adaptations. Meta-learning. Meta-learning-based methods (Alet et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2022) have been studied for test-time adaptation before. Alet et al. (2021) learned to adapt with a contrastive loss. Goyal et al. (2022) meta-learned the loss functions of the test-time adaptation for better adaptation. Xiao et al. (2022) proposed a single sample generalization, which adapts the model to each individual target sample through mimicking domain shifts during training. Our method also learns the adaptation ability under the meta-learning setting. We design meta-adaptation to simulate the test-time adaptation procedure and supervise it based on our probabilistic formulation. We further supervise the meta-adapted model in the meta-target stage to learn the variational pseudo label generation and adaptation ability. Pseudo label learning. In pseudo label learning, the motive is to use a model\u2019s best predictions, e.g., high confidence predictions, and use the corresponding samples and their predictions for retraining the model on a given downstream task. Tasks examples include classification (Yalniz et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020), segmentation (Zou et al., 2020), and object detection (Li et al., 2022). Pham et al. (2021) addresses the problem of confirmation bias in pseudo labeling and utilize a teacher-student network for the task of image classification. For domain generalization and offline adaptation, Abdo et al. (2009) utilize pseudo labels from network extracting features and depth features. For online adaptation, Chen et al. (2022) utilize a contrastive method and utilize pseudo labels to ensure that same class negative samples are not used in contrastive loss optimization. For semi-supervised domain generalization. Zhou et al. (2021) utilize pseudo labels and use confidence as a criteria. In contrast to existing works, our method uses meta learning and is probabilistic in nature for test-time adaptation. 4 EXPERIMENTS:  4.1 SETTINGS: Three datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on image classification and domain generalization settings. We evaluate our method on three widely used datasets in domain generalization. PACS (Li et al., 2017) consists of 7 classes and 4 domains: Photo, Art painting, Cartoon, and Sketch with 9991 samples. We follow the training and validation split in (Li et al., 2017) and evaluate the model according to the \u201cleave-one-out\u201d protocol (Li et al., 2019; Carlucci et al., 2019). We also evaluate our method on the Rotated MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets following Piratla et al. (2020), where the images are rotated by different angles as different domains. We use the subsets with rotation angles from 15\u25e6 to 75\u25e6 in intervals of 15\u25e6 as five source domains, and images rotated by 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 as the target domains. Two adaptation settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate on both offline and online test-time adaptation settings. Offline test-time adaptation assumes there are already unlabeled target data available for adaptation. To be close to real-world application where it is difficult to access the whole target set, we use different amounts of target data for offline adapta- tion. We adapt the model on the available target data and evaluate it on the entire target set without continuously fine-tuning on the entire target set. We also evaluate our method for online test-time adaptation (Iwasawa & Matsuo, 2021). In real-world application, as aforementioned, instead of accessing the entire target set, we usually obtain unlabeled target data in an online manner. To achieve continuous adaptation and improvement of the model on target data, we increment the target data iteratively and keep adapting and evaluating the model on the online target data. Implementation details We make use of ResNet-18 for all our experiments and ablation studies and report the accuracies on ResNet-50 for comparison as well. The backbones are pretrained on ImageNet same as the previous methods. During training, we use a varied learning rate throughout the model. We set the learning rate for the pretrained ResNet to 5e-5 and the learning rate of the variational module and classifiers as 1e-4 for all datasets. During test-time adaptation, we utilize a learning rate of 1e-4 for all layers. 4.2 ABLATION STUDIES: Benefits of our probabilistic test-time adaptation We first investigate the effectiveness of our probabilistic formulation of test-time adaptation and its meta-learned variational pseudo labels. To demonstrate the benefits of the probabilistic formulation, we conduct test-time adaptation with eq. (3) and compare it with a common test-time adaptation tactic (Wang et al., 2021), as in eq. (1). As shown in Table 1, both adaptation with and without probabilistic formulation achieve good improvements over the ERM baseline. Our probabilistic test-time adaptation performs better than the common one on most target domains for both the online and offline adaptation settings, which demonstrates the benefits of modeling uncertainty during adaptation at test time. Moreover, we incorporate the distribution of pseudo labels into the probabilistic formulation, and further propose the variational pseudo labels with meta-adaptation based on the pseudo label distributions. As shown in the fourth and last row in Table 1, our method further improves the performance of both online and offline adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the variational pseudo labels with meta-adaptation. With the probabilistic formulation, it is natural and simple to define the problem as a variational inference problem and solve the problem under the meta-learning framework. The results further demonstrate the benefits and importance of our probabilistic formulations of test-time adaptation. Benefits of variational pseudo-labels Based on the probabilistic formulation, we introduce variational pseudo labels to incorporate the target information of the neighboring target data for each target sample. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our variational pseudo label, we compare it with the normal pseudo labels drawn directly from the prediction distributions of source-trained models. We evaluate the methods in offline adaptation settings with different amounts of target data. As shown in Figure 2 (left), adaptation with our variational pseudo labels achieves better overall results than the normal pseudo labels consistently. We also provide the adaptation results along with adaptation steps in Figure 2 (right). Starting from the same baseline accuracy, the variational pseudo labels achieve faster adaptation than the normal pseudo labels. Adaptation with variational pseudo labels is less prone to saturating in performance, leading to better final accuracy. Offline adaptation with less target data In real applications, it is difficult to access the entire target set at once for adaptation. Therefore, we estimate our method under the offline test-time adaptation settings with different amounts of target data. As shown in Figure 3, the accuracy increases obviously with small numbers of target samples, e.g., 10% and 25%. However, the overall accuracy tends to saturate when keeping increasing the number of target data for adaptation. This indicates that our method is able to achieve good adaptation under the offline adaptation setting with even small amounts of target data, showing the applicability of the proposed method in practice. 4.3 COMPARISONS: To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare our method with some state-ofthe-art test-time adaptation methods in both online and offline adaptation settings. We also compare our method with some domain generalization methods. Table 2 shows the results on PACS based on both ResNet-18 and ResNet-50. Compared with the other state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, our method performs better in both online and offline adaptation settings, especially based on the ResNet-18 backbone. We also conduct experiments on rotated MNIST and rotated Fashion-MNIST for comparison as shown in Table 3. We follow the settings in Piratla et al. (2020) and use ResNet-18 as the backbone. The conclusion is similar to that in PACS. Our method achieves better performance than both the non-adaptive domain generalization methods and adaptation methods. 5 CONCLUSION: We propose to cast test-time adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem and model pseudolabels as distributions in the formulation. By modeling the uncertainty into the pseudo label distributions, the probabilistic formulation mitigates adaptation with inaccurate pseudo labels or predictions, which arises due to domain shifts and lead to misspecified models after adaptation. Based on the probabilistic formulation, we further propose variational pseudo labels under the meta-adaptation paradigm, which exposes the model to domain shifts and learns the ability to adapt with pseudo labels incorporating target information of the neighboring target samples. Ablation studies and further comparisons show the effectiveness of our method."}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None,

Since no specific paper or algorithm is provided, I will interpret this as a *class* of methods that leverage principles of variational inference or probabilistic modeling to improve pseudo-labeling in the TTA setting.\\n\\n**Hypothesized \\\"Variational Pseudo Label (VPL) Approach\\\" for TTA:**\\n\\nLet's assume the proposed VPL approach operates as follows:\\n\\n1.  **Uncertainty Quantification:** Instead of just generating a hard pseudo-label (e.g., argmax of softmax), the method quantifies the uncertainty associated with each prediction on the target domain data. This could be achieved via:\\n    *   **Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout):** Performing multiple stochastic forward passes to estimate the predictive mean and variance/entropy.\\n    *   **Deep Ensembles:** Using an ensemble of models to estimate predictive uncertainty.\\n    *   **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs):** Explicitly modeling weight distributions to derive predictive posteriors.\\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) / Generative Models:** Learning a latent representation of the target data and generating labels from this robust representation, or using the VAE's reconstruction error/latent space properties as uncertainty. (Less common for direct pseudo-labeling, but \\\"variational\\\" could imply this).\\n2.  **Uncertainty-Weighted Pseudo-Labeling:** The self-training loss for TTA is then weighted by this estimated uncertainty. For example:\\n    *   Highly certain pseudo-labels contribute more to the loss (higher weight).\\n    *   Highly uncertain pseudo-labels contribute less or are filtered out (lower weight/discarded).\\n    *   The \\\"variational\\\" aspect might come from optimizing an objective that explicitly incorporates this uncertainty, perhaps by maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood of the true labels given the model and observed data, where the pseudo-labels are treated as latent variables.\\n3.  **Iterative Adaptation:** The model adapts by optimizing this uncertainty-weighted self-training loss on batches of incoming test data, updating its parameters to better align with the target domain while mitigating the noise of pseudo-labels.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of the Hypothesized Variational Pseudo Label (VPL) Approach\\n\\n**1. Novelty:**\\n\\n*   **Core Idea (Uncertainty-Weighted PL):** The concept of using uncertainty to improve pseudo-labeling is not entirely new. Standard pseudo-labeling methods often use confidence thresholds (e.g., only keeping predictions with softmax probabilities > 0.9). Entropy minimization (like TENT) implicitly seeks to reduce uncertainty.\\n*   **\\\"Variational\\\" Aspect:** The novelty significantly increases if the \\\"variational\\\" part implies:\\n    *   **Principled Uncertainty Estimation:** Moving beyond simple softmax thresholds to more robust, probabilistic uncertainty (MC-Dropout, BNNs).\\n    *   **Explicit Objective Formulation:** Integrating this uncertainty directly into a variational objective function (e.g., an ELBO for labels, or a loss function derived from a Bayesian perspective) that the model optimizes during adaptation. This is more sophisticated than just a heuristic confidence threshold.\\n*   **In the Context of TTA:** Applying these principled uncertainty quantification and weighting techniques *specifically* for *test-time adaptation*, where data arrives sequentially and the model must adapt online without source data access, does add novelty. Many existing TTA methods (e.g., TENT, EATA, SHOT) focus on specific normalization layers, entropy minimization, or feature alignment. A direct, principled improvement to pseudo-labeling through a variational lens would be a significant contribution.\\n*   **Conclusion on Novelty:** Moderate to High. While components (uncertainty, pseudo-labeling) exist, the *principled, variational integration* to robustly generate and leverage pseudo-labels for *online test-time adaptation* offers a valuable refinement over heuristic approaches.\\n\\n**2. Effectiveness:**\\n\\n*   **Addresses Key TTA Challenges:**\\n    *   **Noisy Pseudo-Labels:** This is the primary weakness of standard pseudo-labeling. By weighting or filtering based on principled uncertainty, VPL can significantly reduce the impact of incorrect pseudo-labels, leading to more stable and effective adaptation.\\n    *   **Confirmation Bias:** Uncertainty awareness helps mitigate confirmation bias. If the model is highly uncertain about its own prediction, it's less likely to reinforce a wrong prediction with high confidence.\\n    *   **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Samples:** Samples significantly different from the source or past adapted data would likely yield high uncertainty, allowing the model to handle them gracefully (e.g., by assigning them low weight) rather than mislabeling them confidently.\\n*   **Potential for Robustness:** By leveraging probabilistic estimates, VPL is inherently more robust to minor fluctuations or unexpected samples in the target stream compared to brittle thresholding methods.\\n*   **Improved Generalization:** A more robust self-training process leads to a model that generalizes better to the target domain's specific characteristics.\\n\\n**3. Advantages:**\\n\\n*   **Reduced Noise and Bias:** Directly tackles the biggest pain points of standard pseudo-labeling in TTA.\\n*   **Increased Robustness:** Less susceptible to poor initial pseudo-labels or sudden shifts in target data distribution.\\n*   **Principled Approach:** Offers a theoretically more sound way to incorporate label uncertainty compared to arbitrary confidence thresholds.\\n*   **Interpretability:** Uncertainty estimates can provide insights into where the model struggles or where the domain shift is most significant.\\n*   **Applicability:** Can be integrated with various backbone architectures and adapted to different TTA scenarios (classification, segmentation, etc.).\\n\\n**4. Disadvantages:**\\n\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Generating robust uncertainty estimates (e.g., MC-Dropout, Ensembles, BNNs) can significantly increase inference time and computational overhead, which is a critical concern in \\\"test-time\\\" scenarios where efficiency is paramount.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Determining the optimal weighting scheme or filtering thresholds for uncertainty, or calibrating the uncertainty estimates themselves, can introduce new hyperparameters to tune.\\n*   **Calibration of Uncertainty:** The quality of uncertainty estimates is crucial. If the model's uncertainty is poorly calibrated (e.g., overconfident in its wrong predictions), the VPL approach's effectiveness can diminish.\\n*   **Reliance on Initial Model Quality:** While mitigating noise, VPL still fundamentally relies on the initial pre-trained model being *reasonably* good on the target domain for it to generate any useful pseudo-labels at all. If the initial predictions are random, uncertainty estimation won't help.\\n*   **Complexity:** Integrating variational methods or BNNs can increase the overall complexity of the TTA pipeline.\\n\\n**5. Comparison to Existing Techniques:**\\n\\n*   **Standard Pseudo-Labeling:** VPL is a direct and significant improvement, replacing heuristic confidence filtering with a more principled, uncertainty-aware weighting or filtering mechanism.\\n*   **Entropy Minimization (e.g., TENT):** TENT implicitly seeks to reduce uncertainty by pushing predictions to low-entropy (high-confidence) states. VPL, especially with methods like MC-Dropout, *explicitly* models the uncertainty and uses it to weight the training signal, rather than just minimizing entropy of a single prediction. This provides a richer signal.\\n*   **BNNs/MC-Dropout for TTA:** Some TTA methods might *employ* BNNs or MC-Dropout, but VPL specifically integrates them into the *pseudo-labeling process*. It's a method *within* that paradigm, not necessarily an alternative to the BNN framework itself.\\n*   **Feature-Alignment Methods (e.g., SHOT):** These methods focus on aligning feature distributions between source and target. VPL focuses on robust label supervision. They are largely complementary; VPL could potentially be combined with feature-alignment for even better performance.\\n*   **Adaptive Normalization Methods (e.g., AdaBN, CoTTA):** These primarily adapt batch normalization layers. VPL focuses on the loss function and label generation, offering a complementary approach.\\n*   **Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) Methods (e.g., EATA):** EATA filters samples based on entropy and then uses an affinity-based loss. VPL's uncertainty quantification is more robust than simple entropy and can be used for more nuanced weighting. VPL and EATA share the goal of robust pseudo-labeling, but use different mechanisms.\\n\\n**6. Potential Impact:**\\n\\nThe VPL approach has the potential to significantly advance TTA by:\\n*   Establishing a new standard for robust pseudo-label generation in online adaptation settings.\\n*   Opening avenues for more theoretically grounded TTA algorithms.\\n*   Improving performance in safety-critical applications where misclassification or overconfident wrong predictions are costly.\\n*   Bridging the gap between general uncertainty quantification research and practical domain adaptation challenges.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept with Strong Reservations**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe proposed \\\"Variational Pseudo Label\\\" approach, as interpreted, represents a **highly promising and conceptually sound direction** for improving test-time adaptation. Its ability to directly address the fundamental limitations of noisy pseudo-labels and confirmation bias in a principled, uncertainty-aware manner makes it a significant step forward from simpler heuristic methods. The novelty lies not just in using uncertainty, but in a deeper, potentially variational formulation that leverages probabilistic methods for more robust self-supervision.\\n\\nHowever, the \\\"Strong Reservations\\\" come from the **practical challenges associated with its implementation**, particularly regarding:\\n\\n1.  **Computational Cost:** The core strength of TTA is online, real-time adaptation. Methods like MC-Dropout or BNNs, while providing excellent uncertainty estimates, significantly increase inference time, which might make the approach impractical for many real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving, robotics) unless highly optimized or specific low-cost uncertainty methods are employed.\\n2.  **Calibration and Complexity:** Ensuring well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and managing the increased complexity and hyperparameter tuning requirements (e.g., for weighting schemes) can be non-trivial.\\n\\n**For a research publication, this approach is highly valuable because it tackles a core problem with a theoretically robust solution.** It pushes the boundaries of TTA by integrating advanced probabilistic machine learning concepts. The paper should clearly demonstrate performance gains over state-of-the-art TTA methods, rigorously evaluate the computational trade-offs, and discuss strategies for mitigating the practical disadvantages.

The connection to $p(x_T)$ alone without $p(x_T|y_T)$ suggests using the pseudo-labels to guide the *adaptation* of the classifier, possibly by re-estimating $p(y_T | x_T, \\\\theta_T)$ or optimizing a self-supervised loss guided by $y_T$.\\n\\n**Critique of Formulation:**\\n\\n*   **Clarity of Model Components:** It's crucial that the paper clearly defines which parts of the model are being adapted ($\\\\theta_T$), what the latent variables are ($y_T$), and how the pre-trained source knowledge ($\\\\theta_S$) is incorporated (e.g., as initialization, as a regularizer, or directly contributing to the likelihood function).\\n*   **Generative vs. Discriminative Objective:** If the primary goal is classification, introducing a full generative model $p(x|y)$ can be overly complex and unstable for high-dimensional data like images. A formulation that focuses on adapting the discriminative boundary while using latent labels as guidance (e.g., through self-training or consistency regularization) is often more direct. If a generative component $p(x|y)$ is used, its fidelity and ability to model domain shift become critical.\\n*   **Assumptions on Latent Variables:** By treating labels as latent, the model implicitly assumes they exist and are discoverable from the data using the current model's capacity. This is a strong assumption, especially under significant domain shift.\\n*   **Handling Domain Shift:** How does the probabilistic model explicitly account for the domain shift between source and target? Is it implicitly handled by updating parameters on target data, or are there specific terms (e.g., KL divergence between source and target parameter distributions, or source and target latent distributions) that encourage alignment while adapting?\\n*   **Relationship to Source Classifier:** A critical aspect is how the initial pseudo-labels from the source model $p(y|x, \\\\theta_S)$ are leveraged. Are they simply used for initialization of the variational distribution $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$, or do they exert a continuous influence through the objective function (e.g., as a soft prior)?\\n\\n### Variational Inference (VI) Approach\\n\\n**Inferred Approach:**\\nGiven the intractability of summing/integrating over latent $y_T$ in $\\\\log p(x_T | \\\\theta_T)$, VI is a natural choice. The paper likely introduces a tractable variational distribution $q(y_T | x_T, \\\\phi)$ to approximate the true posterior $p(y_T | x_T, \\\\theta_T)$. The objective becomes maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):\\n\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta_T, \\\\phi) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)}[\\\\log p(x_T, y_T | \\\\theta_T)] - \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)}[\\\\log q(y_T | x_T, \\\\phi)]$\\nwhich can be rewritten as:\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta_T, \\\\phi) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)}[\\\\log p(x_T | y_T, \\\\theta_T)] - \\\\text{KL}[q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi) || p(y_T|\\\\theta_T)]$.\\n*Alternatively, if it's purely discriminative and adapts $p(y|x)$, the ELBO might be on a joint $p(x,y|\\\\theta)$ or a form of consistency loss.*\\n\\n**Critique of VI Approach:**\\n\\n*   **Approximation Quality:** VI finds the best approximation *within the family of $q$ distributions*. If $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ is chosen to be a simple distribution (e.g., categorical/softmax output of a network, potentially with a temperature parameter), it might not capture the true complexity of the posterior $p(y_T|x_T, \\\\theta_T)$, especially for deep neural networks.\\n*   **Mean-Field Assumption:** If $y_T$ is a vector of features, and a mean-field approximation is used (i.e., assuming independence between elements of $y_T$), this can be a strong and potentially invalid assumption, leading to an overly confident $q$. For classification labels, $y_T$ is typically a single categorical variable, so this isn't as much of an issue there.\\n*   **Optimization Challenges:**\\n    *   **Non-Convexity:** ELBO maximization is typically a non-convex optimization problem, prone to getting stuck in local optima. This can lead to suboptimal adapted models.\\n    *   **Mode Collapse:** If the generative part $p(x|y)$ is used, VI can be prone to mode collapse, where $q$ only focuses on a subset of the true posterior modes, or the generator collapses to produce only a few types of data. This is less an issue if only $p(y|x)$ is adapted.\\n    *   **Sensitivity to Initialization:** The quality of the initial $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ (likely from the source model $\\\\theta_S$) is critical. A poor initial approximation can lead to bad local optima or divergence.\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Training a deep network via VI can be computationally intensive due to sampling or reparameterization tricks within the training loop, especially compared to simpler TTA methods.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** VI objectives often introduce hyperparameters (e.g., weights for the KL divergence term, if it's treated as a regularization). Tuning these can be challenging and impact performance significantly.\\n*   **Overconfidence:** A common issue with VI is that it tends to output overly confident posterior approximations for $q$. This means the \\\"pseudo-labels\\\" from $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ might be assigned with high certainty even when they are incorrect, leading to error propagation during adaptation.\\n\\n### Validity of Assumptions\\n\\n*   **Shared Label Space:** Assumes the target domain uses the exact same set of labels as the source domain. This is fundamental for TTA.\\n*   **Domain Shift Type:** Typically, TTA methods implicitly assume a *covariate shift* ($p(x_T) \\\\neq p(x_S)$ but $p(y_T|x_T) \\\\approx p(y_S|x_S)$) or a *small concept shift* ($p(y_T|x_T)$ changes slightly). If the concept shift is large, the initial pseudo-labels generated by $\\\\theta_S$ will be highly unreliable, making adaptation difficult and prone to error propagation.\\n*   **Source Model Quality:** The method heavily relies on the source model $p(y|x, \\\\theta_S)$ being reasonably accurate on *target-domain-like* data, at least initially. If the source model performs poorly out-of-the-box on the target domain, the initial $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ will be poor, and the adaptation process might diverge or reinforce incorrect pseudo-labels.\\n*   **Sufficiency of Latent Labels:** Assumes that inferring labels $y_T$ is sufficient for adaptation. Other latent factors of variation (e.g., style, background) are not explicitly modeled, relying on the model to implicitly handle them through label inference.\\n*   **Smoothness of Adaptation:** Implicitly assumes that the adaptation process can smoothly converge to a better set of parameters. Sharp or pathological shifts might break this assumption.\\n*   **Data Distribution:** Assumes that the target data is not adversarial or highly noisy, which could mislead the pseudo-label generation and adaptation process.\\n\\n### Potential Weaknesses or Limitations\\n\\n1.  **Error Propagation (Reinforcement of Mistakes):** This is the most significant risk for any pseudo-labeling approach. If the initial pseudo-labels are incorrect, and the model becomes overconfident (a common VI artifact), it can reinforce these errors, leading to a degraded model rather than improvement.\\n2.  **Sensitivity to Domain Shift Magnitude:** The method's effectiveness will likely degrade significantly with larger domain shifts where the initial pseudo-labels are largely inaccurate.\\n3.  **Computational Overhead:** VI can be computationally expensive, making it slower than simpler TTA methods (e.g., batch norm adaptation, entropy minimization) especially for large models or datasets.\\n4.  **Complexity and Hyperparameter Tuning:** VI introduces more moving parts and potentially more hyperparameters (e.g., related to the $q$ distribution, KL term weighting) compared to simpler TTA strategies, increasing tuning burden.\\n5.  **Lack of Robustness Guarantees:** While probabilistically grounded, there are few theoretical guarantees that maximizing ELBO will lead to improved classification accuracy, especially when the true posterior is complex and the domain shift significant.\\n6.  **Scalability:** How well does the VI training scale to very large batches or streaming data in an online TTA scenario?\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (with Reservations)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe approach presents a **principled and theoretically appealing** method for TTA by treating pseudo-labels as latent variables and employing variational inference. This is a significant step beyond simplistic hard pseudo-labeling, offering the potential for more robust adaptation by accounting for uncertainty. The probabilistic framework allows for a more nuanced understanding of the TTA process.\\n\\nHowever, the \\\"reservations\\\" stem from the practical challenges and inherent limitations of variational inference and pseudo-labeling in general:\\n\\n*   **Practical Hurdles of VI:** The issues of local optima, potential mode collapse, overconfidence, and increased computational complexity are non-trivial. The paper needs to demonstrate that these issues are adequately managed in the context of TTA.\\n*   **Robustness to Shift:** The method's performance under large domain shifts, where initial pseudo-labels are highly unreliable, remains a major question.\\n*   **Error Propagation:** Despite being probabilistic, the risk of propagating and reinforcing initial misclassifications is still present, especially if the variational posterior becomes overly confident.\\n\\nTo warrant a stronger \\\"Accept\\\", the paper would need to thoroughly address these concerns, perhaps by:\\n*   Demonstrating superior empirical performance over state-of-the-art TTA methods, especially under various magnitudes of domain shift.\\n*   Providing ablation studies on the impact of different $q$ families, initialization strategies, and hyperparameters.\\n*   Discussing practical strategies to mitigate overconfidence and error propagation (e.g., regularization, annealing schedules for KL terms, confidence thresholds).\\n*   Analyzing the computational efficiency compared to alternatives.\\n\\nNonetheless, the foundational idea of bringing robust probabilistic inference to TTA's pseudo-label problem is valuable and merits exploration.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9998.5714859\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Critically analyze the probabilistic formulation of test-time adaptation with latent pseudo labels.

The effectiveness, however, hinges critically on the specific implementation details of the framework, the simulation of domain shifts, and the interaction between the meta-adaptation and meta-target stages.\\n\\n#### 1. Meta-Learning Framework Choice (Implicit Assumption)\\n\\nAssuming a framework that trains on a distribution of tasks (domains) to acquire an ability to rapidly adapt to new, unseen tasks (domains), this approach is highly appropriate for tackling domain shifts.\\n\\n*   **Rationale:** Meta-learning, by its nature, aims to find a meta-initialization or a meta-strategy that allows for quick and effective adaptation to new, related tasks. When each \\\"task\\\" represents a distinct domain, the framework learns to quickly bridge the gap from a generic starting point to a specialized model for that domain using minimal data.\\n\\n#### 2. Simulation of Domain Shifts\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most critical aspect and often the weakest link in many meta-learning applications aiming for real-world robustness.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Episodic Training:** If each meta-training episode effectively samples a new \\\"domain\\\" (or a task from a diverse distribution of tasks, each representing a domain), the framework is well-positioned to learn domain-agnostic features or meta-parameters that generalize across various shifts.\\n    *   **Learning to Adapt:** The explicit process of adapting within each episode forces the model to learn *how* to adapt to different domain characteristics, rather than just learning a single, static model.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Rigor and Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Nature of Domain Shifts:** The most crucial detail missing is *how* domain shifts are simulated.\\n        *   **Covariate Shift:** Are the input feature distributions changing (e.g., different lighting, viewpoints, noise levels)?\\n        *   **Concept Shift:** Are the relationships between inputs and outputs changing (e.g., the meaning of a class label varies)?\\n        *   **Prior Probability Shift:** Are the class distributions changing?\\n        *   **Mixture:** Are multiple types of shifts present?\\n        *   *Recommendation:* It is vital to clearly define and ideally quantify the nature and magnitude of these shifts. Randomly sampling tasks is a start, but if the shifts are too simple or uniform, the meta-learned adaptability might not translate to more complex real-world shifts.\\n    *   **Diversity of Simulated Domains:** Is the distribution of simulated domains during meta-training sufficiently rich and diverse to encompass the types of domain shifts expected in deployment? If the meta-training distribution is narrow, the model might only generalize well to shifts *within* that narrow distribution, failing on novel or extreme shifts.\\n    *   **Realism of Simulation:** Are the simulated shifts reflective of real-world phenomena? Synthetic shifts are useful for controlled experiments but should ideally be validated against or augmented with real-world domain discrepancies.\\n    *   **Domain Annotation/Grouping:** How are tasks grouped into \\\"domains\\\"? Is each class a domain? Is each dataset a domain? A clear definition is essential.\\n\\n#### 3. Effectiveness of Meta-Adaptation (Inner Loop / Support Stage)\\n\\nThis stage is where the model specializes to the current task/domain within an episode.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Rapid Specialization:** A well-designed meta-adaptation stage allows the model to quickly \\\"fine-tune\\\" or \\\"align\\\" its parameters to the specific characteristics of the current domain using only a few examples (the support set).\\n    *   **Learning Adaptable Features:** By repeatedly adapting, the meta-learner pushes the base model to learn features that are easily transferable or robust across domains, or to learn a good initial state from which adaptation is efficient.\\n    *   **Number of Steps & Learning Rate:** These hyperparameters are critical. If the inner-loop steps are too few, adaptation might be insufficient. If too many, it risks overfitting the small support set, potentially hindering the meta-gradient signal.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Rigor and Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Adaptation Mechanism:** What specific mechanism is used? (e.g., gradient descent on parameters, attention weights, hypernetworks generating parameters, learning a transformation function). The chosen mechanism must be powerful enough to handle the *degree* of domain shift.\\n    *   **Data Efficiency:** A hallmark of meta-learning is adaptation from very few shots. The number of support examples per domain is crucial. Too many diminishes the \\\"few-shot\\\" advantage; too few might make adaptation unstable.\\n    *   **Optimization Stability:** Is the inner-loop optimization stable? Are gradients well-behaved? Large domain shifts can lead to difficult optimization landscapes during adaptation.\\n\\n#### 4. Effectiveness of Meta-Target (Outer Loop / Query Stage)\\n\\nThis stage evaluates the adapted model and computes the meta-gradient to update the meta-parameters.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Generalization within Domain:** The query set measures the model's ability to generalize to *unseen data from the same specific domain* after adaptation. This is the primary measure of effective per-domain adaptation.\\n    *   **Learning Adaptability:** The meta-loss, computed on the query set after adaptation, guides the meta-learner to find a meta-initialization or meta-strategy that *facilitates* good adaptation across a variety of domains.\\n    *   **Robust Meta-Optimization:** The meta-optimizer aggregates signals from multiple adapted tasks (domains) to improve the meta-parameters, leading to better general adaptability.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Rigor and Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Query Set Size:** The query set must be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of performance on the specific task/domain and a stable meta-gradient.\\n    *   **Task/Domain Definition:** Ensure that the support and query sets within an episode truly belong to the *same* task/domain, with the query set representing unseen data within that specific domain. Misalignment here invalidates the meta-objective.\\n    *   **Meta-Loss Function:** Is the meta-loss function appropriate for the overall objective (e.g., classification accuracy, regression error, or a more complex metric for domain robustness)?\\n    *   **Meta-Optimization Strategy:** The choice of meta-optimizer (e.g., vanilla SGD, Adam, or more specialized meta-optimizers like FOMAML/Reptile's update rules) affects convergence and stability.\\n\\n#### 5. Overall Rigor and Appropriateness\\n\\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Meta-learning frameworks are often very sensitive to hyperparameters (inner/outer learning rates, number of steps, network architecture). Proper tuning and sensitivity analysis are essential.\\n*   **Baselines:** To prove effectiveness, the framework should be compared against:\\n    *   A model trained on pooled data without meta-learning (single static model).\\n    *   A model fine-tuned on new domains without a meta-learned initialization.\\n    *   Other state-of-the-art domain adaptation or generalization techniques.\\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Beyond standard accuracy/loss, consider metrics that directly reflect domain robustness (e.g., average performance across diverse test domains, performance on extreme shifts).\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Ensure results are statistically significant, especially given the variance often observed in episodic meta-learning.\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\nGiven the information provided, and assuming a well-implemented episodic meta-learning framework:\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (with Strong Justification and Required Clarifications)**\\n\\n#### Justification:\\n\\nThe proposed meta-learning framework is a **highly appropriate and principled approach** for addressing domain shifts. Its fundamental strength lies in explicitly training the model to *learn how to adapt* to new environments, which is precisely what is needed for domain generalization and adaptation. The separation into meta-adaptation and meta-target stages correctly captures the inner-loop specialization and outer-loop meta-learning objectives.\\n\\nHowever, the success and rigor of this approach are **critically dependent on specific details that are not fully elaborated upon in the prompt**:\\n\\n1.  **Nature and Diversity of Domain Shifts:** The most significant dependency is on *how* domain shifts are simulated during meta-training. If these simulations are not sufficiently diverse, realistic, and representative of the shifts expected in deployment, the meta-learned adaptability will be limited. Precise characterization and justification for the simulated shifts are paramount.\\n2.  **Implementation Details:** The specific meta-learning algorithm (e.g., MAML, Reptile), the architectural choices, and the hyperparameter settings for both inner and outer loops (e.g., number of inner steps, learning rates, meta-optimizer) profoundly impact effectiveness. Without these details, a definitive assessment of the framework's *practical* effectiveness is difficult.\\n3.  **Experimental Design:** Robust evaluation necessitates strong baselines, diverse test sets (including domains not seen during meta-training but within the expected distribution of shifts), and appropriate statistical analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, the conceptual framework is excellent, but its execution needs careful validation to ensure that the simulated domain shifts adequately prepare the model for real-world generalization challenges. If the *how* of domain shift simulation and the specific implementation details are robust, this framework has strong potential.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9998.57065835\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the meta-learning framework used for training the model, focusing on the simulation of domain shifts and the effectiveness of the meta-adaptation and meta-target stages.

Since no specific paper or algorithm is provided, I will interpret this as a *class* of methods that leverage principles of variational inference or probabilistic modeling to improve pseudo-labeling in the TTA setting.\\n\\n**Hypothesized \"Variational Pseudo Label (VPL) Approach\" for TTA:**\\n\\nLet\\'s assume the proposed VPL approach operates as follows:\\n\\n1.  **Uncertainty Quantification:** Instead of just generating a hard pseudo-label (e.g., argmax of softmax), the method quantifies the uncertainty associated with each prediction on the target domain data. This could be achieved via:\\n    *   **Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout):** Performing multiple stochastic forward passes to estimate the predictive mean and variance/entropy.\\n    *   **Deep Ensembles:** Using an ensemble of models to estimate predictive uncertainty.\\n    *   **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs):** Explicitly modeling weight distributions to derive predictive posteriors.\\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) / Generative Models:** Learning a latent representation of the target data and generating labels from this robust representation, or using the VAE\\'s reconstruction error/latent space properties as uncertainty. (Less common for direct pseudo-labeling, but \"variational\" could imply this).\\n2.  **Uncertainty-Weighted Pseudo-Labeling:** The self-training loss for TTA is then weighted by this estimated uncertainty. For example:\\n    *   Highly certain pseudo-labels contribute more to the loss (higher weight).\\n    *   Highly uncertain pseudo-labels contribute less or are filtered out (lower weight/discarded).\\n    *   The \"variational\" aspect might come from optimizing an objective that explicitly incorporates this uncertainty, perhaps by maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood of the true labels given the model and observed data, where the pseudo-labels are treated as latent variables.\\n3.  **Iterative Adaptation:** The model adapts by optimizing this uncertainty-weighted self-training loss on batches of incoming test data, updating its parameters to better align with the target domain while mitigating the noise of pseudo-labels.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of the Hypothesized Variational Pseudo Label (VPL) Approach\\n\\n**1. Novelty:**\\n\\n*   **Core Idea (Uncertainty-Weighted PL):** The concept of using uncertainty to improve pseudo-labeling is not entirely new. Standard pseudo-labeling methods often use confidence thresholds (e.g., only keeping predictions with softmax probabilities > 0.9). Entropy minimization (like TENT) implicitly seeks to reduce uncertainty.\\n*   **\"Variational\" Aspect:** The novelty significantly increases if the \"variational\" part implies:\\n    *   **Principled Uncertainty Estimation:** Moving beyond simple softmax thresholds to more robust, probabilistic uncertainty (MC-Dropout, BNNs).\\n    *   **Explicit Objective Formulation:** Integrating this uncertainty directly into a variational objective function (e.g., an ELBO for labels, or a loss function derived from a Bayesian perspective) that the model optimizes during adaptation. This is more sophisticated than just a heuristic confidence threshold.\\n*   **In the Context of TTA:** Applying these principled uncertainty quantification and weighting techniques *specifically* for *test-time adaptation*, where data arrives sequentially and the model must adapt online without source data access, does add novelty. Many existing TTA methods (e.g., TENT, EATA, SHOT) focus on specific normalization layers, entropy minimization, or feature alignment. A direct, principled improvement to pseudo-labeling through a variational lens would be a significant contribution.\\n*   **Conclusion on Novelty:** Moderate to High. While components (uncertainty, pseudo-labeling) exist, the *principled, variational integration* to robustly generate and leverage pseudo-labels for *online test-time adaptation* offers a valuable refinement over heuristic approaches.\\n\\n**2. Effectiveness:**\\n\\n*   **Addresses Key TTA Challenges:**\\n    *   **Noisy Pseudo-Labels:** This is the primary weakness of standard pseudo-labeling. By weighting or filtering based on principled uncertainty, VPL can significantly reduce the impact of incorrect pseudo-labels, leading to more stable and effective adaptation.\\n    *   **Confirmation Bias:** Uncertainty awareness helps mitigate confirmation bias. If the model is highly uncertain about its own prediction, it\\'s less likely to reinforce a wrong prediction with high confidence.\\n    *   **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Samples:** Samples significantly different from the source or past adapted data would likely yield high uncertainty, allowing the model to handle them gracefully (e.g., by assigning them low weight) rather than mislabeling them confidently.\\n*   **Potential for Robustness:** By leveraging probabilistic estimates, VPL is inherently more robust to minor fluctuations or unexpected samples in the target stream compared to brittle thresholding methods.\\n*   **Improved Generalization:** A more robust self-training process leads to a model that generalizes better to the target domain\\'s specific characteristics.\\n\\n**3. Advantages:**\\n\\n*   **Reduced Noise and Bias:** Directly tackles the biggest pain points of standard pseudo-labeling in TTA.\\n*   **Increased Robustness:** Less susceptible to poor initial pseudo-labels or sudden shifts in target data distribution.\\n*   **Principled Approach:** Offers a theoretically more sound way to incorporate label uncertainty compared to arbitrary confidence thresholds.\\n*   **Interpretability:** Uncertainty estimates can provide insights into where the model struggles or where the domain shift is most significant.\\n*   **Applicability:** Can be integrated with various backbone architectures and adapted to different TTA scenarios (classification, segmentation, etc.).\\n\\n**4. Disadvantages:**\\n\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Generating robust uncertainty estimates (e.g., MC-Dropout, Ensembles, BNNs) can significantly increase inference time and computational overhead, which is a critical concern in \"test-time\" scenarios where efficiency is paramount.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Determining the optimal weighting scheme or filtering thresholds for uncertainty, or calibrating the uncertainty estimates themselves, can introduce new hyperparameters to tune.\\n*   **Calibration of Uncertainty:** The quality of uncertainty estimates is crucial. If the model\\'s uncertainty is poorly calibrated (e.g., overconfident in its wrong predictions), the VPL approach\\'s effectiveness can diminish.\\n*   **Reliance on Initial Model Quality:** While mitigating noise, VPL still fundamentally relies on the initial pre-trained model being *reasonably* good on the target domain for it to generate any useful pseudo-labels at all. If the initial predictions are random, uncertainty estimation won\\'t help.\\n*   **Complexity:** Integrating variational methods or BNNs can increase the overall complexity of the TTA pipeline.\\n\\n**5. Comparison to Existing Techniques:**\\n\\n*   **Standard Pseudo-Labeling:** VPL is a direct and significant improvement, replacing heuristic confidence filtering with a more principled, uncertainty-aware weighting or filtering mechanism.\\n*   **Entropy Minimization (e.g., TENT):** TENT implicitly seeks to reduce uncertainty by pushing predictions to low-entropy (high-confidence) states. VPL, especially with methods like MC-Dropout, *explicitly* models the uncertainty and uses it to weight the training signal, rather than just minimizing entropy of a single prediction. This provides a richer signal.\\n*   **BNNs/MC-Dropout for TTA:** Some TTA methods might *employ* BNNs or MC-Dropout, but VPL specifically integrates them into the *pseudo-labeling process*. It\\'s a method *within* that paradigm, not necessarily an alternative to the BNN framework itself.\\n*   **Feature-Alignment Methods (e.g., SHOT):** These methods focus on aligning feature distributions between source and target. VPL focuses on robust label supervision. They are largely complementary; VPL could potentially be combined with feature-alignment for even better performance.\\n*   **Adaptive Normalization Methods (e.g., AdaBN, CoTTA):** These primarily adapt batch normalization layers. VPL focuses on the loss function and label generation, offering a complementary approach.\\n*   **Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) Methods (e.g., EATA):** EATA filters samples based on entropy and then uses an affinity-based loss. VPL\\'s uncertainty quantification is more robust than simple entropy and can be used for more nuanced weighting. VPL and EATA share the goal of robust pseudo-labeling, but use different mechanisms.\\n\\n**6. Potential Impact:**\\n\\nThe VPL approach has the potential to significantly advance TTA by:\\n*   Establishing a new standard for robust pseudo-label generation in online adaptation settings.\\n*   Opening avenues for more theoretically grounded TTA algorithms.\\n*   Improving performance in safety-critical applications where misclassification or overconfident wrong predictions are costly.\\n*   Bridging the gap between general uncertainty quantification research and practical domain adaptation challenges.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept with Strong Reservations**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe proposed \"Variational Pseudo Label\" approach, as interpreted, represents a **highly promising and conceptually sound direction** for improving test-time adaptation. Its ability to directly address the fundamental limitations of noisy pseudo-labels and confirmation bias in a principled, uncertainty-aware manner makes it a significant step forward from simpler heuristic methods. The novelty lies not just in using uncertainty, but in a deeper, potentially variational formulation that leverages probabilistic methods for more robust self-supervision.\\n\\nHowever, the \"Strong Reservations\" come from the **practical challenges associated with its implementation**, particularly regarding:\\n\\n1.  **Computational Cost:** The core strength of TTA is online, real-time adaptation. Methods like MC-Dropout or BNNs, while providing excellent uncertainty estimates, significantly increase inference time, which might make the approach impractical for many real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving, robotics) unless highly optimized or specific low-cost uncertainty methods are employed.\\n2.  **Calibration and Complexity:** Ensuring well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and managing the increased complexity and hyperparameter tuning requirements (e.g., for weighting schemes) can be non-trivial.\\n\\n**For a research publication, this approach is highly valuable because it tackles a core problem with a theoretically robust solution.** It pushes the boundaries of TTA by integrating advanced probabilistic machine learning concepts. The paper should clearly demonstrate performance gains over state-of-the-art TTA methods, rigorously evaluate the computational trade-offs, and discuss strategies for mitigating the practical disadvantages.

Since the specific paper is not provided, this analysis will draw upon common practices in probabilistic modeling, variational inference, and domain adaptation, inferring the likely structure based on the prompt\\'s keywords.\\n\\nThe core idea appears to be to leverage the robust framework of probabilistic modeling and variational inference to handle the uncertainty inherent in pseudo-labels during TTA, moving beyond simplistic hard assignments.\\n\\n### Probabilistic Formulation\\n\\n**Inferred Formulation:**\\nA common probabilistic formulation for such a problem would involve:\\n1.  **A Pre-trained Source Model:** A neural network classifier, $p(y|x, \\\\theta_S)$, trained on source data. $\\\\theta_S$ are fixed parameters.\\n2.  **Target Data:** Unlabeled instances $x_T$ from a target domain.\\n3.  **Latent Pseudo-Labels:** For each target instance $x_T$, there\\'s a corresponding latent variable $y_T$ representing its true (unknown) label.\\n4.  **Adapted Model:** The goal is to adapt the source model parameters $\\\\theta_S$ to $\\\\theta_T$, such that $p(y|x, \\\\theta_T)$ performs well on the target domain.\\n5.  **Objective:** The paper likely formulates the problem as maximizing the marginal likelihood of the target data, $p(x_T | \\\\theta_T) = \\\\sum_{y_T} p(x_T, y_T | \\\\theta_T)$, where $y_T$ are treated as latent variables.\\n    *   The joint $p(x_T, y_T | \\\\theta_T)$ could be decomposed in several ways:\\n        *   $p(x_T | y_T, \\\\theta_{T,gen}) p(y_T | \\\\theta_{T,prior})$ (Generative model)\\n        *   $p(y_T | x_T, \\\\theta_{T,disc}) p(x_T | \\\\theta_{T,prior})$ (Discriminative model with a generative prior on X)\\n        *   Most likely, it\\'s about adapting the *discriminative* component $p(y_T | x_T, \\\\theta_T)$ and inferring $y_T$ given $x_T$. The connection to $p(x_T)$ alone without $p(x_T|y_T)$ suggests using the pseudo-labels to guide the *adaptation* of the classifier, possibly by re-estimating $p(y_T | x_T, \\\\theta_T)$ or optimizing a self-supervised loss guided by $y_T$.\\n\\n**Critique of Formulation:**\\n\\n*   **Clarity of Model Components:** It\\'s crucial that the paper clearly defines which parts of the model are being adapted ($\\\\theta_T$), what the latent variables are ($y_T$), and how the pre-trained source knowledge ($\\\\theta_S$) is incorporated (e.g., as initialization, as a regularizer, or directly contributing to the likelihood function).\\n*   **Generative vs. Discriminative Objective:** If the primary goal is classification, introducing a full generative model $p(x|y)$ can be overly complex and unstable for high-dimensional data like images. A formulation that focuses on adapting the discriminative boundary while using latent labels as guidance (e.g., through self-training or consistency regularization) is often more direct. If a generative component $p(x|y)$ is used, its fidelity and ability to model domain shift become critical.\\n*   **Assumptions on Latent Variables:** By treating labels as latent, the model implicitly assumes they exist and are discoverable from the data using the current model\\'s capacity. This is a strong assumption, especially under significant domain shift.\\n*   **Handling Domain Shift:** How does the probabilistic model explicitly account for the domain shift between source and target? Is it implicitly handled by updating parameters on target data, or are there specific terms (e.g., KL divergence between source and target parameter distributions, or source and target latent distributions) that encourage alignment while adapting?\\n*   **Relationship to Source Classifier:** A critical aspect is how the initial pseudo-labels from the source model $p(y|x, \\\\theta_S)$ are leveraged. Are they simply used for initialization of the variational distribution $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$, or do they exert a continuous influence through the objective function (e.g., as a soft prior)?\\n\\n### Variational Inference (VI) Approach\\n\\n**Inferred Approach:**\\nGiven the intractability of summing/integrating over latent $y_T$ in $\\\\log p(x_T | \\\\theta_T)$, VI is a natural choice. The paper likely introduces a tractable variational distribution $q(y_T | x_T, \\\\phi)$ to approximate the true posterior $p(y_T | x_T, \\\\theta_T)$. The objective becomes maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):\\n\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta_T, \\\\phi) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)}[\\\\log p(x_T, y_T | \\\\theta_T)] - \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)}[\\\\log q(y_T | x_T, \\\\phi)]$\\nwhich can be rewritten as:\\n$\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta_T, \\\\phi) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)}[\\\\log p(x_T | y_T, \\\\theta_T)] - \\\\text{KL}[q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi) || p(y_T|\\\\theta_T)]$.\\n*Alternatively, if it\\'s purely discriminative and adapts $p(y|x)$, the ELBO might be on a joint $p(x,y|\\\\theta)$ or a form of consistency loss.*\\n\\n**Critique of VI Approach:**\\n\\n*   **Approximation Quality:** VI finds the best approximation *within the family of $q$ distributions*. If $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ is chosen to be a simple distribution (e.g., categorical/softmax output of a network, potentially with a temperature parameter), it might not capture the true complexity of the posterior $p(y_T|x_T, \\\\theta_T)$, especially for deep neural networks.\\n*   **Mean-Field Assumption:** If $y_T$ is a vector of features, and a mean-field approximation is used (i.e., assuming independence between elements of $y_T$), this can be a strong and potentially invalid assumption, leading to an overly confident $q$. For classification labels, $y_T$ is typically a single categorical variable, so this isn\\'t as much of an issue there.\\n*   **Optimization Challenges:**\\n    *   **Non-Convexity:** ELBO maximization is typically a non-convex optimization problem, prone to getting stuck in local optima. This can lead to suboptimal adapted models.\\n    *   **Mode Collapse:** If the generative part $p(x|y)$ is used, VI can be prone to mode collapse, where $q$ only focuses on a subset of the true posterior modes, or the generator collapses to produce only a few types of data. This is less an issue if only $p(y|x)$ is adapted.\\n    *   **Sensitivity to Initialization:** The quality of the initial $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ (likely from the source model $\\\\theta_S$) is critical. A poor initial approximation can lead to bad local optima or divergence.\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Training a deep network via VI can be computationally intensive due to sampling or reparameterization tricks within the training loop, especially compared to simpler TTA methods.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** VI objectives often introduce hyperparameters (e.g., weights for the KL divergence term, if it\\'s treated as a regularization). Tuning these can be challenging and impact performance significantly.\\n*   **Overconfidence:** A common issue with VI is that it tends to output overly confident posterior approximations for $q$. This means the \"pseudo-labels\" from $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ might be assigned with high certainty even when they are incorrect, leading to error propagation during adaptation.\\n\\n### Validity of Assumptions\\n\\n*   **Shared Label Space:** Assumes the target domain uses the exact same set of labels as the source domain. This is fundamental for TTA.\\n*   **Domain Shift Type:** Typically, TTA methods implicitly assume a *covariate shift* ($p(x_T) \\\\neq p(x_S)$ but $p(y_T|x_T) \\\\approx p(y_S|x_S)$) or a *small concept shift* ($p(y_T|x_T)$ changes slightly). If the concept shift is large, the initial pseudo-labels generated by $\\\\theta_S$ will be highly unreliable, making adaptation difficult and prone to error propagation.\\n*   **Source Model Quality:** The method heavily relies on the source model $p(y|x, \\\\theta_S)$ being reasonably accurate on *target-domain-like* data, at least initially. If the source model performs poorly out-of-the-box on the target domain, the initial $q(y_T|x_T, \\\\phi)$ will be poor, and the adaptation process might diverge or reinforce incorrect pseudo-labels.\\n*   **Sufficiency of Latent Labels:** Assumes that inferring labels $y_T$ is sufficient for adaptation. Other latent factors of variation (e.g., style, background) are not explicitly modeled, relying on the model to implicitly handle them through label inference.\\n*   **Smoothness of Adaptation:** Implicitly assumes that the adaptation process can smoothly converge to a better set of parameters. Sharp or pathological shifts might break this assumption.\\n*   **Data Distribution:** Assumes that the target data is not adversarial or highly noisy, which could mislead the pseudo-label generation and adaptation process.\\n\\n### Potential Weaknesses or Limitations\\n\\n1.  **Error Propagation (Reinforcement of Mistakes):** This is the most significant risk for any pseudo-labeling approach. If the initial pseudo-labels are incorrect, and the model becomes overconfident (a common VI artifact), it can reinforce these errors, leading to a degraded model rather than improvement.\\n2.  **Sensitivity to Domain Shift Magnitude:** The method\\'s effectiveness will likely degrade significantly with larger domain shifts where the initial pseudo-labels are largely inaccurate.\\n3.  **Computational Overhead:** VI can be computationally expensive, making it slower than simpler TTA methods (e.g., batch norm adaptation, entropy minimization) especially for large models or datasets.\\n4.  **Complexity and Hyperparameter Tuning:** VI introduces more moving parts and potentially more hyperparameters (e.g., related to the $q$ distribution, KL term weighting) compared to simpler TTA strategies, increasing tuning burden.\\n5.  **Lack of Robustness Guarantees:** While probabilistically grounded, there are few theoretical guarantees that maximizing ELBO will lead to improved classification accuracy, especially when the true posterior is complex and the domain shift significant.\\n6.  **Scalability:** How well does the VI training scale to very large batches or streaming data in an online TTA scenario?\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (with Reservations)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe approach presents a **principled and theoretically appealing** method for TTA by treating pseudo-labels as latent variables and employing variational inference. This is a significant step beyond simplistic hard pseudo-labeling, offering the potential for more robust adaptation by accounting for uncertainty. The probabilistic framework allows for a more nuanced understanding of the TTA process.\\n\\nHowever, the \"reservations\" stem from the practical challenges and inherent limitations of variational inference and pseudo-labeling in general:\\n\\n*   **Practical Hurdles of VI:** The issues of local optima, potential mode collapse, overconfidence, and increased computational complexity are non-trivial.

The effectiveness, however, hinges critically on the specific implementation details of the framework, the simulation of domain shifts, and the interaction between the meta-adaptation and meta-target stages.\\n\\n#### 1. Meta-Learning Framework Choice (Implicit Assumption)\\n\\nAssuming a framework that trains on a distribution of tasks (domains) to acquire an ability to rapidly adapt to new, unseen tasks (domains), this approach is highly appropriate for tackling domain shifts.\\n\\n*   **Rationale:** Meta-learning, by its nature, aims to find a meta-initialization or a meta-strategy that allows for quick and effective adaptation to new, related tasks. When each \"task\" represents a distinct domain, the framework learns to quickly bridge the gap from a generic starting point to a specialized model for that domain using minimal data.\\n\\n#### 2. Simulation of Domain Shifts\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most critical aspect and often the weakest link in many meta-learning applications aiming for real-world robustness.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Episodic Training:** If each meta-training episode effectively samples a new \"domain\" (or a task from a diverse distribution of tasks, each representing a domain), the framework is well-positioned to learn domain-agnostic features or meta-parameters that generalize across various shifts.\\n    *   **Learning to Adapt:** The explicit process of adapting within each episode forces the model to learn *how* to adapt to different domain characteristics, rather than just learning a single, static model.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Rigor and Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Nature of Domain Shifts:** The most crucial detail missing is *how* domain shifts are simulated.\\n        *   **Covariate Shift:** Are the input feature distributions changing (e.g., different lighting, viewpoints, noise levels)?\\n        *   **Concept Shift:** Are the relationships between inputs and outputs changing (e.g., the meaning of a class label varies)?\\n        *   **Prior Probability Shift:** Are the class distributions changing?\\n        *   **Mixture:** Are multiple types of shifts present?\\n        *   *Recommendation:* It is vital to clearly define and ideally quantify the nature and magnitude of these shifts. Randomly sampling tasks is a start, but if the shifts are too simple or uniform, the meta-learned adaptability might not translate to more complex real-world shifts.\\n    *   **Diversity of Simulated Domains:** Is the distribution of simulated domains during meta-training sufficiently rich and diverse to encompass the types of domain shifts expected in deployment? If the meta-training distribution is narrow, the model might only generalize well to shifts *within* that narrow distribution, failing on novel or extreme shifts.\\n    *   **Realism of Simulation:** Are the simulated shifts reflective of real-world phenomena? Synthetic shifts are useful for controlled experiments but should ideally be validated against or augmented with real-world domain discrepancies.\\n    *   **Domain Annotation/Grouping:** How are tasks grouped into \"domains\"? Is each class a domain? Is each dataset a domain? A clear definition is essential.\\n\\n#### 3. Effectiveness of Meta-Adaptation (Inner Loop / Support Stage)\\n\\nThis stage is where the model specializes to the current task/domain within an episode.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Rapid Specialization:** A well-designed meta-adaptation stage allows the model to quickly \"fine-tune\" or \"align\" its parameters to the specific characteristics of the current domain using only a few examples (the support set).\\n    *   **Learning Adaptable Features:** By repeatedly adapting, the meta-learner pushes the base model to learn features that are easily transferable or robust across domains, or to learn a good initial state from which adaptation is efficient.\\n    *   **Number of Steps & Learning Rate:** These hyperparameters are critical. If the inner-loop steps are too few, adaptation might be insufficient. If too many, it risks overfitting the small support set, potentially hindering the meta-gradient signal.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Rigor and Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Adaptation Mechanism:** What specific mechanism is used? (e.g., gradient descent on parameters, attention weights, hypernetworks generating parameters, learning a transformation function). The chosen mechanism must be powerful enough to handle the *degree* of domain shift.\\n    *   **Data Efficiency:** A hallmark of meta-learning is adaptation from very few shots. The number of support examples per domain is crucial. Too many diminishes the \"few-shot\" advantage; too few might make adaptation unstable.\\n    *   **Optimization Stability:** Is the inner-loop optimization stable? Are gradients well-behaved? Large domain shifts can lead to difficult optimization landscapes during adaptation.\\n\\n#### 4. Effectiveness of Meta-Target (Outer Loop / Query Stage)\\n\\nThis stage evaluates the adapted model and computes the meta-gradient to update the meta-parameters.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Generalization within Domain:** The query set measures the model\\'s ability to generalize to *unseen data from the same specific domain* after adaptation. This is the primary measure of effective per-domain adaptation.\\n    *   **Learning Adaptability:** The meta-loss, computed on the query set after adaptation, guides the meta-learner to find a meta-initialization or meta-strategy that *facilitates* good adaptation across a variety of domains.\\n    *   **Robust Meta-Optimization:** The meta-optimizer aggregates signals from multiple adapted tasks (domains) to improve the meta-parameters, leading to better general adaptability.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Rigor and Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Query Set Size:** The query set must be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of performance on the specific task/domain and a stable meta-gradient.\\n    *   **Task/Domain Definition:** Ensure that the support and query sets within an episode truly belong to the *same* task/domain, with the query set representing unseen data within that specific domain. Misalignment here invalidates the meta-objective.\\n    *   **Meta-Loss Function:** Is the meta-loss function appropriate for the overall objective (e.g., classification accuracy, regression error, or a more complex metric for domain robustness)?\\n    *   **Meta-Optimization Strategy:** The choice of meta-optimizer (e.g., vanilla SGD, Adam, or more specialized meta-optimizers like FOMAML/Reptile\\'s update rules) affects convergence and stability.\\n\\n#### 5. Overall Rigor and Appropriateness\\n\\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Meta-learning frameworks are often very sensitive to hyperparameters (inner/outer learning rates, number of steps, network architecture). Proper tuning and sensitivity analysis are essential.\\n*   **Baselines:** To prove effectiveness, the framework should be compared against:\\n    *   A model trained on pooled data without meta-learning (single static model).\\n    *   A model fine-tuned on new domains without a meta-learned initialization.\\n    *   Other state-of-the-art domain adaptation or generalization techniques.\\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Beyond standard accuracy/loss, consider metrics that directly reflect domain robustness (e.g., average performance across diverse test domains, performance on extreme shifts).\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Ensure results are statistically significant, especially given the variance often observed in episodic meta-learning.\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\nGiven the information provided, and assuming a well-implemented episodic meta-learning framework:\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (with Strong Justification and Required Clarifications)**\\n\\n#### Justification:\\n\\nThe proposed meta-learning framework is a **highly appropriate and principled approach** for addressing domain shifts. Its fundamental strength lies in explicitly training the model to *learn how to adapt* to new environments, which is precisely what is needed for domain generalization and adaptation. The separation into meta-adaptation and meta-target stages correctly captures the inner-loop specialization and outer-loop meta-learning objectives.\\n\\nHowever, the success and rigor of this approach are **critically dependent on specific details that are not fully elaborated upon in the prompt**:\\n\\n1.  **Nature and Diversity of Domain Shifts:** The most significant dependency is on *how* domain shifts are simulated during meta-training. If these simulations are not sufficiently diverse, realistic, and representative of the shifts expected in deployment, the meta-learned adaptability will be limited. Precise characterization and justification for the simulated shifts are paramount.\\n2.  **Implementation Details:** The specific meta-learning algorithm (e.g., MAML, Reptile), the architectural choices, and the hyperparameter settings for both inner and outer loops (e.g., number of inner steps, learning rates, meta-optimizer) profoundly impact effectiveness. Without these details, a definitive assessment of the framework\\'s *practical* effectiveness is difficult.\\n3.  **Experimental Design:** Robust evaluation necessitates strong baselines, diverse test sets (including domains not seen during meta-training but within the expected distribution of shifts), and appropriate statistical analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, the conceptual framework is excellent, but its execution needs careful validation to ensure that the simulated domain shifts adequately prepare the model for real-world generalization challenges.
