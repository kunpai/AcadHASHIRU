The paper title is: Self-supervision through Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC)\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Deep learning has powered enormous successes in Computer Vision and NLP over the past 10, or so, years. It has lead to significant improvements in object detection (Redmon et al., 2016), segmentation (He et al., 2017), as well as higher-level cognition tasks (e.g., Visual Question Answering (Antol et al., 2015), Visual Navigation (Mayo et al., 2021), etc.). These successes have been enabled by both advances in parallel hardware (GPUs) and, perhaps more importantly, large-scale task-specific labeled datasets that allow supervised learning. This appetite for large data has, until very recently, stagnated progress, particularly in building general-purpose visual architectures. These types of considerations date back to the early days of machine learning, and deep learning in particular, where it has long been postulated that unsupervised, or self-supervised, learning could allow learning of robust and general feature representations that can then be readily used (or finetuned) to target tasks. Self-supervised learning has been explored in computer vision in various forms: denoising autoencoders (Pathak et al., 2016; Vincent et al., 2008), colorization (Zhang et al., 2016) or jigsaw puzzle (Doersch et al., 2015; Noroozi & Favaro, 2016) proxy objectives. However, the success of such self-supervised pre-training was somewhat limited. In contrast, the success of similar self-supervised ideas in NLP has been much more dominant with GPT (Brown et al., 2020) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) architectures, and their variants. These pre-training strategies now enable state-of-the-art performance on a wide array of natural language tasks. Recent advances in vision architectures, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), which serialize visual 2d data, have opened an opportunity to apply similar large scale pre-training techniques in vision, with increasing successes. Self-supervised pre-training techniques with ViTs can be characterized into two broad categories: contrastive and predictive; as well as their combinations. In contrastive learning, pre-training architectures are learned to be invariant to certain perturbations in data (e.g., spatial shifts, color jitter) by forming positive and negative pairings of augmented data samples. This is a powerful technique, but requires designers to make assumptions about invariances that the architecture should learn. In addition, purely contrastive models tend to incorporate center bias (Chen et al., 2022; 2021a), which makes them less transferable for tasks such as segmentation where non-object centric regions need to be modeled. Alternatively, predictive models learn to predict elements of the scene, either in parallel by reconstructing masked regions/tokens (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021) (a.k.a., masked image modeling or BERT-style pre-training) or to predict images in auto-regressive language-modeling manner (Chen et al., 2020a) (a.k.a., GPT-style pre-training). It is interesting to observe that on the NLP side, GPT models have shown to be powerful, while vision models have gravitated more towards BERT-style pre-training both with visual (Chen et al., 2020a; Bao et al., 2022) and multi-modal data (Lu et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020). Motivated by this, we adopt an autoregressive pre-training strategy (see Figure 1) and ask a number of important empirical questions about the use of such pre-training and what makes it effective. Specifically, (1) we ask what granularity (scale) and shape of tokens (patches, blobs) is most effective and how it affects the performance? (2) How best to serialize predictions? For example, previous approaches, such as image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a), leveraged raster ordering. While such ordering is perhaps \u201coptimal\u201d from correlation and predictive/generative (van den Oord et al., 2016) points of view, we show that it is not optimal for general feature learning. We also explore (3) whether deterministic vs. stochastic tokenization and serialization are helpful. Finally, (4) we explore the effective interactions between the decoder and encoder layers; proposing a new ViT architecture that uses learned skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to improve performance. Contributions. We make two core contributions. First, we propose a new pre-training strategy that leverages (randomly) sampled hierarchical segment cluster traversals to autoregresively train ViT models. This allows both short- and long-term spatial predictions, allowing distribution over easy and hard predictive tasks1. We note that the effectiveness of single random segment inpainting was initially observed in (Pathak et al., 2016), but is notably missing from most recent self-supervised strategies. Our pre-training strategy generalizes this observation and strategy to hierarchical and serialized predictions. Second, we propose a flexible ViT decoder that at each decoding layer learns to dynamically attend over different levels of features in the encoder. This in effect creates learned skip-connections, as compared to UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and others that require fixed connections in a symmetric encoder-decoder design, which further improve the performance. Discussion. The above pre-training strategy, while empirically motivated, is also loosely modeled after human vision. Humans attend to the scene by a sequence of foveal observations, where an eye shifts over a series of fixation points; such motions are called saccades. Some saccades are longrange and voluntary, while others are local and involuntary (a.k.a., microsaccades (Rolfs, 2009)). Our segments can be \u201cviewed\u201d as predictive foveal regions, and the hierarchical serialization of such regions as the combination of micro and macro saccades. The significant difference from human vision, is that in human vision saccades are purposeful and have been shown to be conditioned on the task (Yarbus, 1967). In contrast, our pre-training such \u201csaccadic\u201d movements are randomly sampled. Learning a purposeful policy for hierarchical serialization of segments, would be an interesting future work. However, this is a difficult task that is beyond the scope of this paper. 1This is, in part, motivated by (He et al., 2021) which observe that in BERT-style pre-training high amount of masking (as much as 75%), which corresponds to harder predictive tasks, leads to better feature learning. 2 RELATED WORK: Transformer-based Natural Language Modeling. In the field of natural language processing (NLP), two dominant self-supervised language modeling paradigms are Masked Language Modeling, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), and GPT-style autoregressive pre-training (Brown et al., 2020; Radford & Narasimhan, 2018; Radford et al., 2019). Given a sentence, BERT and its variants (Lan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019) pre-train transformer encoders by predicting randomly masked out input words, referred to as tokens. Such frameworks model the bidirectional (contextual) dependencies between the visible tokens and the corrupted/masked tokens. GPT, which can be viewed as a special case of the transformer decoder, on the other hand, models the left-to-right natural order of languages. Recent advances in large-scale generative language modeling show powerful few-shot capabilities and are believed to be a promising path towards general machine intelligence. Permutation-based autoregressive model (Yang et al., 2019) was proposed to bridge the gap between autoregressive language modeling and masked autoencoding by maximizing the likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. We take inspiration from GPT-style autoregressive pre-training in formulating our model, and focus on important aspects of mapping such strategy onto visual (ViT) models, where tokenization and serialization are not as well defined as in language. Contrastive Image Learning. Contrastive methods (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; van den Oord et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020) and their negative-sample-free variants (Chen & He, 2021; Grill et al., 2020; Hua et al., 2021; Zbontar et al., 2021) have emerged as a dominant research direction for unsupervised/self-supervised visual representation learning over the past 1\u20132 years. By building agreement among augmented versions of the input data, image features that are invariant of those perturbations can be learned. This method implicitly assumes a set of representational invariance (e.g., color and spatial invariance). Once such representations are learned they are either used directly, or fine-tuned, to one or more downstream supervised tasks (e.g., classification, detection, segmentation). When a downstream task violates the aforementioned invariance assumptions, they display poor transferability (Xiao et al., 2021). For example, the center-bias (Chen et al., 2022) and small-object feature suppression (Chen et al., 2021a) have been observed in prior works. Masked image modeling & autoregressive image encoding, of which our method is an instance, tend to perform better in such circumstances (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021). Masked Image Modeling. Early CNN-based masked image modeling, also known as image inpainting (Doersch et al., 2015; Pathak et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018), has shown promising results but failed to become a predominant training paradigm, in part, due to its inferior performance with respect to large-scale supervised pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet). The recent trend of incorporating transformers into vision architectures (Carion et al., 2020), or replacing CNN completely (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), by tokenizing images into a grid of non-overlapping patches, have enabled application of large scale NLP pretraining techniques in vision, e.g., (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). Directly applying them to image pixels, however, leads to inferior performance (Chen et al., 2020a; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). To this end, BEiT (Bao et al., 2022) proposes to predict discrete masked image tokens. Masked Autoencoder (MAE) (He et al., 2021) suggests a 75% random masking ratio for image modeling; and SimMIM (Xie et al., 2022) studies different masking strategies for pretraining. MaskFeat (Wei et al., 2021) investigates five different reconstruction targets, and SplitMask (El-Nouby et al., 2021) illustrates the ability of BEiT to train with small scale pre-training datasets. Our proposed RandSAC strategy, is related to masked image modeling, but is autoregressive in nature. Autoregressive Image Encoding. Compared with BERT-style pre-training for vision transformers, GPT-like autoregressive models have been overlooked due to their complexity introduced by dense image pixels. In image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a), images are limited to 64\u00d7 64 = 4096 pixels. The 4096 pixels are tokenized and serialized in raster-order before feeding into a causal transformer. The quadratic time/space complexity of self-attention prevents the scaling of such approaches. 3 RANDOM SEGMENT WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE CODING: RandSAC learns representations through autoregressive image segment prediction. It partitions a tokenized image into random spatially coherent non-overlapping (hierarchical) segments, serializes them, and then autoregressively predicts tokens within these ordered segments. As a result, the token predictions between segments are sequential, while within a segment are parallel. This training strategy has four important components that we will explore: \u2022 Tokenization. To use a transformer-based architecture, images need to be tokenized, i.e., transformed into a set of basic image elements. For example, some approaches discretize images (Bao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2020a), while others patchify them (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; He et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). Tokenization strategy dictates the scale and number of tokens, which affects performance and computation cost. \u2022 Segment Partitioning. After tokenizing the image, the tokens are grouped into spatially coherent segments. Those segments are autoregressively predicted following some prescribed serialization order. The size and shape of segments and the way they are traversed can affect training and downstream performance. \u2022 Serialization Strategy. Serialization strategy affects the traversal order of segments. In prior autoregressive modeling (Chen et al., 2020a) raster-order is assumed. We show that stochastic (i.e., randomized) serialization is much more effective. \u2022 Transformer Architecture. In a GPT-style autoregressive model, the target sequence is identical to the shifted input sequence throughout training. However, for random segment prediction, the target sequence order varies for each sample. To enable this, we leverage a transformer decoder which takes as input position of each token and outputs its predicted representation conditioned on the transformer encoded context. In addition, we propose a novel trainable skip-connection layer for efficient decoding. In the following section, the default option for model architecture is the vanilla masked transformer introduced in Section 4. We experiment with two different datasets, CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and, where appropriate, ImageNet100 (Tian et al., 2020). Evaluation protocols are described in Section 5, and implementation details are in the Supplemental. We use a simple mean square error (MSE) as our pixel reconstruction objective. 3.1 FROM PIXELS TO TOKENS: Tokenization. We start from raster-order serialization and compare two different tokenization strategies introduced by iGPT (Chen et al., 2020a) and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Assume a datasetD of images X \u2208 RH\u00d7W\u00d7C , where H,W,C are the height, width, and the number of channels of the image. We reshape each image into N = HW/P 2 patches, where P is the resolution of each patch. Tokens are obtained by linearly projecting the patches X = {xi}Ni=1 and serialized row-by-row. For pixel prediction experiment, we set P = 1, letting image patch size be 1\u00d71 pixels (see Figure 2 (b)). For ViT style patch prediction experiment, we split the 32\u00d7 32 CIFAR10 image into 8\u00d7 8 = 64 patches (see Figure 2 (c)), each patch consists of 4 \u00d7 4 pixels (P = 4). Note that for a fair comparison, we didn\u2019t strictly follow iGPT, where they minimize the negative log-likelihood of the quantized RGB values. We simply adopt a mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and target pixel values for all our experiments following (He et al., 2021). Note that for visualizations in Figure 2 we use a downsampled CIFAR10 image. The results for these two tokenization options are illustrated in Table 1 (additional scales are in Supplemental) under pixel-raster and patch-raster respectively in terms of linear probing and fine-tuning accuracy (see Sec. 5.1 for definition of metrics). From the point of view of representation learning, patches are substantially better. Further, computationally, the self-attention mechanism in a transformer uses O(n2) in both time and space with respect to the sequence length. Hence for pixel tokenization, the complexity is O((HW )2). For patches, the complexity is reduced to O((HW/P 2)2). In our CIFAR10 experiment, when P = 4, the complexity of training is lowered by a factor of P 4 = 256. Hence, patches result in better tokenization. Stochastic Serialization. Randomized pretext tasks play an important role in a range of selfsupervised learning algorithms. In NLP, for example, (Yang et al., 2019) improves fixed-order autoregressive language models by allowing all possible permutations of the factorization order during training. For autoregressive ViT training of stochastic token serialization, we adopt a similar strategy by shuffling the token sequence for each image sample. Note that this does not mean that our prediction sequence is \u201corderless\u201d. By moving from fixed raster-order prediction to randomized sequence prediction, keeping all else the same, we observe 20% improvement in linear evaluation and \u223c10% in fine-tuning (Table 2 CIFAR10). Improvements on ImageNet100 are more modest (3.67% and \u223c2% respectively), but still significant and overall stochastic serialization is clearly superior. 3.2 GROUPING TOKENS INTO SEGMENTS: In this section, we introduce a concept of segments, which we define as groups (or clusters) of tokens. Effectively each segment forms an equivalency class within our serialized order, where tokens are encoded and decoded in parallel. Across segments, however, predictions are still strictly sequential. The motivation for introducing segments is two-fold. First, it allows us to reduce the overall number of autoregressive prediction steps. Second, it allows our autoregressive strategy to effectively leverage aspects of parallel, BERT-style, prediction locally. The autoregressive prediction steps can also be changed without introducing parallel prediction, simply by changing the patch size P . This is ineffective, however, as we show in Supplemental Section A.1. In what follows, we experiment with two spatially coherent segment strategies (square and blob) and then look at the importance of this spatial coherence in segment formation. Square Segments. Once we have a grid of N patches of size HP \u00d7 W P , we reshape the tokens into a set of square segments M \u00d7M , where the M denotes the size of the square. The segment count K of an image of H \u00d7 W is thus defined by: K = H\u00d7W(P\u00d7M)2 . For example, in our CIFAR10 experiment, an input image of size 32\u00d7 32 is tokenized into a grid of 8\u00d7 8 tokens, each of which is a 4\u00d7 4 pixel patch. We set the square size M = 2. The tokens are then split into (8/2)2 = 16 segments, which are shuffled randomly for autoregressive prediction as before. We list the representation quality with different square segment size (M ) in Table 3. Since the grid size is 8 \u00d7 8 for CIFAR10, we chose square sizes M = [1, 2, 4]. Note that, when M = 8, there will be only one segment (e.g., K = 1) and no prediction can be made; M = 1 is equivalent to no segments (i.e., patch-random in Table 2). Blob Segments. We define blob segments as irregular elliptical segments defined by a sampled Mixture of Gaussians. To obtain K random blobs for a given image, we first sample K Gaussians with a range of means and standard deviations in the image space. Then we simply assign each token xi which is at position (xi, yi) to the closest mixture component using Mahalanobis distance. We illustrate the square and blob strategies in Figure 2 (e) and (f), respectively. Note that beyond the shape, blob segments allow for variability in size squares do not. See details in Suppl. Section A.2. Analysis. As can be seen from Table 4, both square segments and blob segments surpass segment- patch-random square-random blob-random CF10-LIN(\u2191) 75.53 81.38 82.52 CF10-FT(\u2191) 87.52 91.38 91.53 IN100-LIN(\u2191) 53.02 64.78 65.00 IN100-FT(\u2191) 84.15 86.22 85.16 Table 4: Segments on CIFAR10. free patch-based autoregression (see square-random and blob-random compared with patch-random). The blob segments and square segments behave similarly. In addition, with blobs, we can easily modify the number of segments. However, with squares, the segment number is constrained by the token number. A grid of 8\u00d78 tokens can either be segmented into 4\u00d7 4 or 2\u00d7 2 squares. A grid size of 13\u00d7 13 can not be divided into any kind of squares. Blob segments, on the other hand, are more flexible. Do segments need to be spatially coherent? The idea of a \u201csegment\u201d puts emphasis on the spatial coherence of the tokens. The upper part of Table 5 shows the performance of feature representations with respect to the number of blob segments K. In the bottom, we randomly shuffle all tokens so that tokens in any given \u201csegment\u201d no longer spatially coherent. We observe that feature learning deteriorates when segments are not spatially coherent. Note that segments without spatial coherence are still consistently better than patch-random from Table 4. 3.3 HIERARCHICAL SEGMENT SERIALIZATION: Images are hierarchical: a visual region of an image can often be interpreted as a component of a greater whole (Hinton, 2021) (e.g., parts make up object, object scenes, and so on). Such compositionality motivates hierarchical groupings. In our case of random segment serialization, we postulate that similar hierarchical traversal order, which adds certain degree of locality, may be useful. In Figure 3 we illustrate this concept that we operationalize. An image is first partitioned into 16 square segments, indicated by different colors and shades. We then group these 16 segments into 4 larger partitions following the same logic for segment generation. Different colors (e.g., blue, orange, purple, and green) represent these partition groups; segments that share partition differ in shade. Hierarchical serialization is obtained by randomly, and sequentially, predicting the segments inside of each partition group (shown by the black arrows), and then jumping to another partition group at random. Note that the segment-level (local) and partition-level (global) serializations are both random. This idea can be extended to deeper hierarchies, with the depth of the hierarchy and grouping chosen based on the resolution and nature of the dataset. Experimental results that compare flat serialization to two-level hierarchy are illustrated in Table 6. We perform these experiments on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets. Our experiments show that hierarchical serialization and prediction consistently outperform the flat counterparts. 4 ARCHITECTURE: Image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a) performs autoregressive prediction by shifting the source sequence one pixel to the right. Since the raster ordering of iGPT is fixed for all samples, the position for the next target token is implicitly modeled by the transformer. In contrast, in RandSAC, the next token depends on the serialization strategy, thus can vary from sample to sample during training. Moreover, when predicting the next segment, the tokens within each segment should be predicted jointly (in parallel). This requires lateral pathways that allow communication within target segments. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose to utilize the transformer decoder. 4.1 MASKED TRANSFORMER FOR SEGMENT PREDICTION: A standard transformer has an encoder-decoder structure (Vaswani et al., 2017). The encoder of a transformer maps a list of tokens X = (x1, ...,xn) to a sequence of hidden representations Z = (z1, ..., zn), also known as the memory. Given X and source sequence Xsrc = (x1, ...,xn\u22121), during training, the decoder masks the internal attention matrix with a causal mask and predicts the target sequence Xtgt = (x2, ...,xn) autoregressively. Each layer of the transformer encoder has two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a fully connected feed-forward network; both have residual connections. The decoder layer has a third attention sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention from the hidden representation Z to the target representation Xtgt. We leverage attention masking to achieve autoregressive segment prediction using this framework; we discuss details next. Autoregressive Segment Encoder. Figure 4 shows our transformer encoder block and a decoder block. We leave out the fully connected layer and residual connections for simplicity and only show the attentions. In this visualization, there are six patches. These six patches are then grouped into three segments denoted by colors: green, blue, and red. The random segment serialization order is green \u2192 blue \u2192 red. One layer of transformer encoder is illustrated on the left in light green. Serialized six patches/tokens with added fixed sine-cosine positional encoding are the input to the encoder. The encoder attention is masked following the serialized segment order: segments can attend to themselves and preceding segments only. They are restricted from looking at future seg- ments using the, illustrated, source mask. Lastly, since the last segment does not have a succeeding segment, we only input the first four patches and leave out the two patches in the last segment. Autoregressive Segment Decoder. The input for the transformer decoder, illustrated on the right of Figure 4 in pink, is a set of fixed positional encodings to guide the reconstruction of target segments and tokens. Similar to the encoder input where we leave out the last segment patches, in the decoder, we shift the target sequence one segment to the left and ignore the positional encodings of the first segment because it does not have a preceding segment. The self-attention layer of the decoder is masked the same way as the encoder for autoregressive segment decoding. This layer enables co-attention over preceding and current segments for context. Evaluation. During linear evaluation and fine-tuning, both the attention masks and decoder are removed, and the encoder is used as feature extractor for the downstream supervised classification. 4.2 TRAINABLE SKIP CONNECTIONS: The original transformer decoder layer can only attend to the same encoder output, often from the last layer of the encoder. In contrast, CNN encoder-decoder architectures are often symmetric with skip connections between encoder and decoder layers, e.g., UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015). We hypothesize that in our design, skip-connections between transformer encoder and decoder can similarly be beneficial. To enable such skip connections, we propose a trainable skip connection module that learns how to assign encoder memory to the decoder layers. Specifically, for a transformer with Lenc and Ldec number of layers, we learn a linear layer with parameters W \u2208 RLenc\u00d7Ldec , such that: Zl = \u2211Lenc k=1 Wl,kH k enc, where H k enc is an encoder representation from layer k and Z l is the formed memory for decoder layer l. Note, the linearly formed memory cells are conditioned on, and different, for each individual decoder layer. We refer the reader to the Supplemental Section A.3 for details and experiments that validate the effectiveness of this design and discuss efficiency. 5 EXPERIMENTS: We test RandSAC in two drastically different settings: low-data and ImageNet-1K pre-training. We evaluate the classification performance of our pretrained backbone with linear probing and finetuning. We also test the transfer learning ability of our ImageNet pretrained model (Suppl. Sec. D.3). General Implementation Details. We adopt minimal data augmentation strategy and use the normalized pixel value from (He et al., 2021) as our patch regression target. We obtain the reconstruction target by normalizing target pixels using the mean and standard deviation of the patch they belong. Our loss function computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted pixel values and patch-normalized reconstruction target. Low-data Pretraining. Vision transformers are known to be \u201cdata hungry\u201d (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and require a large dataset and a series of data augmentations to pretrain (Touvron et al., 2021). To experiment in such a challenging setting, we evaluate our method on small-scale datasets. We train a \u201csquare\u201d and \u201cblob\u201d RandSAC models using 16\u2192 4 and 11\u2192 5 hierarchies respectively. Pretraining on ImageNet-1K. ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 (Deng et al., 2009) is a popular large scale image dataset with 1.28 million images and 1000 categories. We train \u201csquare\u201d RandSAC (16\u2192 4). Detailed implementation details for all three settings are given in Supplemental Appendix B. 5.1 EVALUATION PROTOCOLS: Linear Probing. This measure is widely used for quantifying the quality of representation learning. It learns a linear classifier on top of the frozen feature of a pretrained encoder to classify the objectlevel classification labels. Then performance is evaluated using the val/test set. End-to-end Fine-tuning. A recent study (Chen et al., 2022) shows that linear evaluation favors those methods with a center-bias such as contrastive learning. To complement linear probing, we also include 100-epoch fine-tuning evaluation. In fine-tuning, all parameters are optimized for classification. The fine-tuning recipe follows the common practice of supervised ViT training. 5.2 RESULTS Table 7 shows low-data classification performance for contrastive pretraining (DINO (Caron et al., 2021)), masked image encoding (MAE (He et al., 2021)) and our segment autoregressive coding (RandSAC). The MAE and DINO are pretrained using their official implementations. For MAE we use a 75% masking ratio as suggested in their paper. All models\u00b7 are pretrained for 1600 epochs and evaluated with both 90-epoch linear probing (LIN) and 100-epoch fine-tuning (FT). Under the low data benchmark, RandSAC outperforms other non-autoregressive algorithms and direct supervised training, by a large margin. Both the square and the blob hierarchical versions work well. We postulate that the superior performance of RandSAC comes from randomized segment prediction pretext task. The autoregressive coding objective that we propose, which is to traverse a hierarchy of randomly serialized visual segments, diversifies the small dataset, and serves as a sort of data augmentation. Table 8 shows ImageNet pretraining result. We compare RandSAC with contrastive transformer training approaches (DINO (Caron et al., 2021) & MoCo v3 (Chen et al., 2021b)), masked image encoding (BEIT (Bao et al., 2022) & MAE (He et al., 2021)), and our autoregressive counterpart iGPT (Chen et al., 2020a). We note, that due to limited access to computation, we were only able to run RandSAC once, without any parameter tuning. Nevertheless, RandSAC outperforms all predictive (non-contrastive methods) in linear probing, despite using a smaller image size for pretraining (192 vs 224). It is also among the best in fine-tuning (on par with MAE and better than the rest). Contrastive models do tend to perform better in linear probing, but also differ in pre-training. For example, contrastive methods require two global crops of the input image while other methods only process one crop; DINO uses 10 local crops. In addition, linear probing for DINO and iGPT is evaluated using the last 4 and 5 transformer blocks, respectively, while MoCo v3, MAE, and RandSAC only evaluate the last block output. A longer feature vector tends to result in better linear probing accuracy (Caron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a). Lastly, it is worth mentioning that RandSAC can be easily combined with contrastive objectives in the future. 6 CONCLUSION: We present a new self-supervised pre-training strategy we call RandSAC. In doing so, we also study and provide general insights into ViT pre-training (e.g., tokenization, segmentation, and serialization). We found randomized serialization of hierarchical image segments significantly improves autoregressive pre-training of ViTs. In addition, we propose a new design for the transformer decoder, which facilitates improved performance. We show evidence that the proposed task and model could be the key to developing a powerful GPT-like model for visual representation learning.

As we discuss in the main paper (Section 3.2), the control (mainly reduction) over the number of autoregressive steps can be achieved by simply varying the patch size P in the patch-random model. The result of this on CIFAR10 are illustrated in Table 9. It can clearly be seen that a different patch size P does not lead to improved representation for a segment-free patch-random prediction task. The segment formation, on the other hand, as we show in the paper, does substantially improve the performance. A.2 BLOB SEGMENTS.: We define blob segments as irregular elliptical segments defined by a sampled Mixture of Gaussians. To obtainK random blobs for a given image, we first sampleK Gaussians with means sampled from [\u00b5 (x) k , \u00b5 (y) k ] \u223c U(\u22121.75, 1.75) and standard deviations from [\u03c3 (x) k , \u03c3 (y) k ] \u223c U(0.5, 1), where U is a uniform distribution. Then we simply assign each token xi which is at a normalized position (xi, yi) in the range of [\u22122, 2] (i.e., leftmost top token is at (-2,-2), rightmost bottom token is at (2,2)). The assignment is done as follows: S(xi) = argmax k N ([ xi yi ] | [ \u00b5 (x) k \u00b5 (y) k ] , [ \u03c3 (x) k 0 0 \u03c3 (y) k ]2) . (1) S is a function that maps tokens to segments. The sampling for both square and blob is only used during segment predictive training and is disabled during evaluation. The computation cost for sampling is, comparatively, negligible. Note that beyond the shape, blob segments allow for variability in size squares do not. A.3 TRAINABLE SKIP CONNECTIONS: We define a transformer design, with learnable skip connections, that we leverage for our main experiments in Section 4.2 of the main paper. Here we provide additional details and evaluation of that design which is illustrated in Figure 5 (right). A transformer with Lenc encoder layers and Ldec decoder layers processes input X into Lenc hidden representations Hlenc = (h l 1, ...,h l n). In traditional masked transformer, decoder memory is set to Zl = HLencenc for each layer l of the decoder. Instead, we introduce a linear attention layer that allows each decoder layer to attend over encoding hidden representations. In other words, we learn a linear layer with parameters W \u2208 RLenc\u00d7Ldec , such that: Zl = \u2211Lenc k=1 Wl,kH k enc. Note, the linearly combined memory cells are conditioned on, and different, for each individual decoder layer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Masked Transformer and trainable skip connection layer for segment prediction, we compare three architectures: Two-stream Transformer. This design was proposed in (Yang et al., 2019) for permutation-based language modeling. It enables randomized target predictions by leveraging a two-stream attention layer: the content stream encodes the full contextual information, and the query stream, which only has access to the previous content, is designed to make current predictions. We apply this architecture for our segment prediction by setting the content mask with our \u201csource mask\u201d and query mask with our \u201cmemory mask\u201d. Model weights for both content stream and query stream are shared (see Figure 5 (left) for illustration of design). Masked Transformer. For masked transformer we utilize architecture described in Section 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4; also in Figure 5 (middle). Compared with the Two-stream Transformer above, this design enables communication among jointly predicted tokens within a segment. Also, compared with Two-stream Transformer, weights for encoding and decoding the segment content are decoupled in the Masked Transformer. Masked Transformer with Trainable Skip Connections. A Masked Transformer only decodes based on the (last layer) encoder output. A trainable skip connection layer we introduce dynamically allocates memory assignments between intermediate layers of transformer-encoder-decoder (see Figure 5 (right)). As can be seen from the results in Table 10, this variant does outperform the two competitors on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets. Compared with Masked Transformer, the additional computation cost introduced by trainable linear layer is almost negligible (Table 11). B EXPERIMENTS:  B.1 SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION ON ADE20K.: We take our pretrained backbone as initialization and end-to-end fine-tune with UpperNet framework on ADE20k to evaluate the performance of our pretrained model on downstream task, semantic segmentation. We follow the same setting of BeiT (Bao et al., 2022). We compare our pre-training with DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), MoCo (Chen et al., 2021b), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and BeiT (Bao et al., 2022) in Table 12. Our pre-training outperform DeiT, MoCo, DINO, BeiT by 1.0, 0.8, 0.8 and 1.5, respectively. B.2 VISUALIZATION OF RECONSTRUCTION ON IMAGENET-1K VALIDATION SET B.3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We describe implementation details omitted from the main paper due to space limitations here. Implementation Details. We adopt minimal data augmentation strategy following (He et al., 2021): resize cropping with scale range of [0.2, 1.0] and aspect ratio is sampled within range [ 34 , 4 3 ], followed by a 50% chance random horizontal flipping. We do not use color jittering, path dropping, or gradient clip in pretraining. We use AdamW as optimizer and pretrain RandSAC for 1600 epochs. We use a linear lr scaling rule (Goyal et al., 2017) that scales the base lr by batchsize/256. The lr is scheduled to warm-up from 0 to base lr, then decayed following a cosine-decay rule (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016). For both benchmarks, we use the normalized pixel loss introduced from (He et al., 2021) as our patch regression target. Our loss function computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the patch-normalized reconstruction and original image pixels. B.4 EVALUATION PROTOCOLS: Linear Probing. Note that the dimension of the feature that the classifier is trained on, may influence the eventual accuracy readout (Caron et al., 2021). A longer feature vector is likely to produce a better linear result. Prior works such as (Caron et al., 2021) concatenate the feature vectors from the last 4 ViT blocks and (Chen et al., 2020a) use feature vectors up to 15360 dimensions for evaluation. We, however, use only the last encoder averaged feature output following (He et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021b) (i.e., 384 dimensions for ViT-S and 768 dimensions for ViT-B). The linear classifier is trained for 90 epochs. C DETAILS FOR SECTION 3:  C.1 PRE-TRAINING SETTINGS FOR CIFAR10 AND IMAGENET100: The following is the experiment configurations for CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 from Section 3 of the main paper, including Table 9 and 10 in Appendix. Details for end-to-end fine-tuning and linear probing are the same with ImageNet-1K. For Table 10, both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 experiments are trained using a \u201cBlob\u201d RandSAC model using hierarchy 11\u21925. C.1.1 CIFAR10 EXPERIMENTS.: The default setting is illustrated in Table 13. We pre-train ViT-Tiny encoder on CIFAR10. The ViTTiny has 12 layers. Each layer has 192 dimensions and 3 self-attention heads. We chose patch size 4 \u00d7 4 and split the 32 \u00d7 32 images into 8 \u00d7 8 tokens. For segment decoding, we use 3 transformer decoder layers following the same configuration for the encoder. C.1.2 IMAGENET100 EXPERIMENTS. Experiments that involve ImageNet100 are Table 2, 4, 6 and 10. We pre-train ViT-Small encoder on ImageNet100 (Tian et al., 2020). The ViT-Small backbone has 12 layers. Each layer has 384 dimensions and 6 self-attention heads. We chose patch size 16 \u00d7 16 following (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and split the 224\u00d7 224 images into 14\u00d7 14 tokens. For segment decoding, we use a 4 layer transformer decoder and double the attention heads while keeping all other configurations the same as the ViT-Small encoder. D DETAILS FOR SECTION 4:  D.1 LOW-DATA PRE-TRAINING SETTING: We pre-train ViT-Small on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2009). Both datasets are smallscale image datasets containing 60000 32\u00d7 32 images that belong to 10 and 100 categories, respectively. The ViT-Small has 12 layers. Each layer has 384 dimensions and 6 self-attention heads. We chose patch size 4 \u00d7 4 and split the 32 \u00d7 32 images into 8 \u00d7 8 tokens. For segment decoding, we use a 6 transformer decoder layer. The attention-head and feature dimensions of the decoder are the same as the encoder. We also set the decoder for MAE (He et al., 2021) to have the same depth, attention head, and dimension as ours. D.2 IMAGENET-1K PRE-TRAINING SETTING We resize the images to 192 \u00d7 192 during pretraining and set patch size P to be 16. We pretrain square-RandSAC with hierarchy 16 \u21924 using ViT-Base (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) on ImageNet1K following (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021). ViT-Base model has 12 blocks, with each block having dimension 768 and 12 heads. We chose an 8 layer decoder. The attention-head and feature dimensions of the decoder are the same as the encoder. D.3 EVALUATION CONFIGURATIONS: Different from ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), where an additional class token is required for classification, we directly use the averaged pooled feature out of the encoder for both fine-tuning and linear probing. The hyper-parameters for both end-to-end finetuning and linear probing from Table 17 and Table 18 are used for all experiments of this paper. E IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION We end-to-end fine-tune our pre-trained ViT encoder with UpperNet framework on ADE20k to evaluate the performance on downstream task, semantic segmentation. We follow the same setting of BeiT (Bao et al., 2022). We take AdamW as the optimizer and set the batch size to 16, the layerwise decay rate to 0.65, the input resolution to 512 \u00d7 512, fine-tuning iterations are set to 160K steps. During evaluation, we do not take multi-scale testing strategy in our experiment. F CODE AND REPRODUCIBILITY: We include an implementation of RandSAC-Square model using PyTorch.

The paper title is: Self-supervision through Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC)\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Deep learning has powered enormous successes in Computer Vision and NLP over the past 10, or so, years. It has lead to significant improvements in object detection (Redmon et al., 2016), segmentation (He et al., 2017), as well as higher-level cognition tasks (e.g., Visual Question Answering (Antol et al., 2015), Visual Navigation (Mayo et al., 2021), etc.). These successes have been enabled by both advances in parallel hardware (GPUs) and, perhaps more importantly, large-scale task-specific labeled datasets that allow supervised learning. This appetite for large data has, until very recently, stagnated progress, particularly in building general-purpose visual architectures. These types of considerations date back to the early days of machine learning, and deep learning in particular, where it has long been postulated that unsupervised, or self-supervised, learning could allow learning of robust and general feature representations that can then be readily used (or finetuned) to target tasks. Self-supervised learning has been explored in computer vision in various forms: denoising autoencoders (Pathak et al., 2016; Vincent et al., 2008), colorization (Zhang et al., 2016) or jigsaw puzzle (Doersch et al., 2015; Noroozi & Favaro, 2016) proxy objectives. However, the success of such self-supervised pre-training was somewhat limited. In contrast, the success of similar self-supervised ideas in NLP has been much more dominant with GPT (Brown et al., 2020) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) architectures, and their variants. These pre-training strategies now enable state-of-the-art performance on a wide array of natural language tasks. Recent advances in vision architectures, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), which serialize visual 2d data, have opened an opportunity to apply similar large scale pre-training techniques in vision, with increasing successes. Self-supervised pre-training techniques with ViTs can be characterized into two broad categories: contrastive and predictive; as well as their combinations. In contrastive learning, pre-training architectures are learned to be invariant to certain perturbations in data (e.g., spatial shifts, color jitter) by forming positive and negative pairings of augmented data samples. This is a powerful technique, but requires designers to make assumptions about invariances that the architecture should learn. In addition, purely contrastive models tend to incorporate center bias (Chen et al., 2022; 2021a), which makes them less transferable for tasks such as segmentation where non-object centric regions need to be modeled. Alternatively, predictive models learn to predict elements of the scene, either in parallel by reconstructing masked regions/tokens (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021) (a.k.a., masked image modeling or BERT-style pre-training) or to predict images in auto-regressive language-modeling manner (Chen et al., 2020a) (a.k.a., GPT-style pre-training). It is interesting to observe that on the NLP side, GPT models have shown to be powerful, while vision models have gravitated more towards BERT-style pre-training both with visual (Chen et al., 2020a; Bao et al., 2022) and multi-modal data (Lu et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020). Motivated by this, we adopt an autoregressive pre-training strategy (see Figure 1) and ask a number of important empirical questions about the use of such pre-training and what makes it effective. Specifically, (1) we ask what granularity (scale) and shape of tokens (patches, blobs) is most effective and how it affects the performance? (2) How best to serialize predictions? For example, previous approaches, such as image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a), leveraged raster ordering. While such ordering is perhaps \u201coptimal\u201d from correlation and predictive/generative (van den Oord et al., 2016) points of view, we show that it is not optimal for general feature learning. We also explore (3) whether deterministic vs. stochastic tokenization and serialization are helpful. Finally, (4) we explore the effective interactions between the decoder and encoder layers; proposing a new ViT architecture that uses learned skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to improve performance. Contributions. We make two core contributions. First, we propose a new pre-training strategy that leverages (randomly) sampled hierarchical segment cluster traversals to autoregresively train ViT models. This allows both short- and long-term spatial predictions, allowing distribution over easy and hard predictive tasks1. We note that the effectiveness of single random segment inpainting was initially observed in (Pathak et al., 2016), but is notably missing from most recent self-supervised strategies. Our pre-training strategy generalizes this observation and strategy to hierarchical and serialized predictions. Second, we propose a flexible ViT decoder that at each decoding layer learns to dynamically attend over different levels of features in the encoder. This in effect creates learned skip-connections, as compared to UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and others that require fixed connections in a symmetric encoder-decoder design, which further improve the performance. Discussion. The above pre-training strategy, while empirically motivated, is also loosely modeled after human vision. Humans attend to the scene by a sequence of foveal observations, where an eye shifts over a series of fixation points; such motions are called saccades. Some saccades are longrange and voluntary, while others are local and involuntary (a.k.a., microsaccades (Rolfs, 2009)). Our segments can be \u201cviewed\u201d as predictive foveal regions, and the hierarchical serialization of such regions as the combination of micro and macro saccades. The significant difference from human vision, is that in human vision saccades are purposeful and have been shown to be conditioned on the task (Yarbus, 1967). In contrast, our pre-training such \u201csaccadic\u201d movements are randomly sampled. Learning a purposeful policy for hierarchical serialization of segments, would be an interesting future work. However, this is a difficult task that is beyond the scope of this paper. 1This is, in part, motivated by (He et al., 2021) which observe that in BERT-style pre-training high amount of masking (as much as 75%), which corresponds to harder predictive tasks, leads to better feature learning. 2 RELATED WORK: Transformer-based Natural Language Modeling. In the field of natural language processing (NLP), two dominant self-supervised language modeling paradigms are Masked Language Modeling, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), and GPT-style autoregressive pre-training (Brown et al., 2020; Radford & Narasimhan, 2018; Radford et al., 2019). Given a sentence, BERT and its variants (Lan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019) pre-train transformer encoders by predicting randomly masked out input words, referred to as tokens. Such frameworks model the bidirectional (contextual) dependencies between the visible tokens and the corrupted/masked tokens. GPT, which can be viewed as a special case of the transformer decoder, on the other hand, models the left-to-right natural order of languages. Recent advances in large-scale generative language modeling show powerful few-shot capabilities and are believed to be a promising path towards general machine intelligence. Permutation-based autoregressive model (Yang et al., 2019) was proposed to bridge the gap between autoregressive language modeling and masked autoencoding by maximizing the likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. We take inspiration from GPT-style autoregressive pre-training in formulating our model, and focus on important aspects of mapping such strategy onto visual (ViT) models, where tokenization and serialization are not as well defined as in language. Contrastive Image Learning. Contrastive methods (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; van den Oord et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020) and their negative-sample-free variants (Chen & He, 2021; Grill et al., 2020; Hua et al., 2021; Zbontar et al., 2021) have emerged as a dominant research direction for unsupervised/self-supervised visual representation learning over the past 1\u20132 years. By building agreement among augmented versions of the input data, image features that are invariant of those perturbations can be learned. This method implicitly assumes a set of representational invariance (e.g., color and spatial invariance). Once such representations are learned they are either used directly, or fine-tuned, to one or more downstream supervised tasks (e.g., classification, detection, segmentation). When a downstream task violates the aforementioned invariance assumptions, they display poor transferability (Xiao et al., 2021). For example, the center-bias (Chen et al., 2022) and small-object feature suppression (Chen et al., 2021a) have been observed in prior works. Masked image modeling & autoregressive image encoding, of which our method is an instance, tend to perform better in such circumstances (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021). Masked Image Modeling. Early CNN-based masked image modeling, also known as image inpainting (Doersch et al., 2015; Pathak et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018), has shown promising results but failed to become a predominant training paradigm, in part, due to its inferior performance with respect to large-scale supervised pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet). The recent trend of incorporating transformers into vision architectures (Carion et al., 2020), or replacing CNN completely (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), by tokenizing images into a grid of non-overlapping patches, have enabled application of large scale NLP pretraining techniques in vision, e.g., (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). Directly applying them to image pixels, however, leads to inferior performance (Chen et al., 2020a; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). To this end, BEiT (Bao et al., 2022) proposes to predict discrete masked image tokens. Masked Autoencoder (MAE) (He et al., 2021) suggests a 75% random masking ratio for image modeling; and SimMIM (Xie et al., 2022) studies different masking strategies for pretraining. MaskFeat (Wei et al., 2021) investigates five different reconstruction targets, and SplitMask (El-Nouby et al., 2021) illustrates the ability of BEiT to train with small scale pre-training datasets. Our proposed RandSAC strategy, is related to masked image modeling, but is autoregressive in nature. Autoregressive Image Encoding. Compared with BERT-style pre-training for vision transformers, GPT-like autoregressive models have been overlooked due to their complexity introduced by dense image pixels. In image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a), images are limited to 64\u00d7 64 = 4096 pixels. The 4096 pixels are tokenized and serialized in raster-order before feeding into a causal transformer. The quadratic time/space complexity of self-attention prevents the scaling of such approaches. 3 RANDOM SEGMENT WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE CODING: RandSAC learns representations through autoregressive image segment prediction. It partitions a tokenized image into random spatially coherent non-overlapping (hierarchical) segments, serializes them, and then autoregressively predicts tokens within these ordered segments. As a result, the token predictions between segments are sequential, while within a segment are parallel. This training strategy has four important components that we will explore: \u2022 Tokenization. To use a transformer-based architecture, images need to be tokenized, i.e., transformed into a set of basic image elements. For example, some approaches discretize images (Bao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2020a), while others patchify them (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; He et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). Tokenization strategy dictates the scale and number of tokens, which affects performance and computation cost. \u2022 Segment Partitioning. After tokenizing the image, the tokens are grouped into spatially coherent segments. Those segments are autoregressively predicted following some prescribed serialization order. The size and shape of segments and the way they are traversed can affect training and downstream performance. \u2022 Serialization Strategy. Serialization strategy affects the traversal order of segments. In prior autoregressive modeling (Chen et al., 2020a) raster-order is assumed. We show that stochastic (i.e., randomized) serialization is much more effective. \u2022 Transformer Architecture. In a GPT-style autoregressive model, the target sequence is identical to the shifted input sequence throughout training. However, for random segment prediction, the target sequence order varies for each sample. To enable this, we leverage a transformer decoder which takes as input position of each token and outputs its predicted representation conditioned on the transformer encoded context. In addition, we propose a novel trainable skip-connection layer for efficient decoding. In the following section, the default option for model architecture is the vanilla masked transformer introduced in Section 4. We experiment with two different datasets, CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and, where appropriate, ImageNet100 (Tian et al., 2020). Evaluation protocols are described in Section 5, and implementation details are in the Supplemental. We use a simple mean square error (MSE) as our pixel reconstruction objective. 3.1 FROM PIXELS TO TOKENS: Tokenization. We start from raster-order serialization and compare two different tokenization strategies introduced by iGPT (Chen et al., 2020a) and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Assume a datasetD of images X \u2208 RH\u00d7W\u00d7C , where H,W,C are the height, width, and the number of channels of the image. We reshape each image into N = HW/P 2 patches, where P is the resolution of each patch. Tokens are obtained by linearly projecting the patches X = {xi}Ni=1 and serialized row-by-row. For pixel prediction experiment, we set P = 1, letting image patch size be 1\u00d71 pixels (see Figure 2 (b)). For ViT style patch prediction experiment, we split the 32\u00d7 32 CIFAR10 image into 8\u00d7 8 = 64 patches (see Figure 2 (c)), each patch consists of 4 \u00d7 4 pixels (P = 4). Note that for a fair comparison, we didn\u2019t strictly follow iGPT, where they minimize the negative log-likelihood of the quantized RGB values. We simply adopt a mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and target pixel values for all our experiments following (He et al., 2021). Note that for visualizations in Figure 2 we use a downsampled CIFAR10 image. The results for these two tokenization options are illustrated in Table 1 (additional scales are in Supplemental) under pixel-raster and patch-raster respectively in terms of linear probing and fine-tuning accuracy (see Sec. 5.1 for definition of metrics). From the point of view of representation learning, patches are substantially better. Further, computationally, the self-attention mechanism in a transformer uses O(n2) in both time and space with respect to the sequence length. Hence for pixel tokenization, the complexity is O((HW )2). For patches, the complexity is reduced to O((HW/P 2)2). In our CIFAR10 experiment, when P = 4, the complexity of training is lowered by a factor of P 4 = 256. Hence, patches result in better tokenization. Stochastic Serialization. Randomized pretext tasks play an important role in a range of selfsupervised learning algorithms. In NLP, for example, (Yang et al., 2019) improves fixed-order autoregressive language models by allowing all possible permutations of the factorization order during training. For autoregressive ViT training of stochastic token serialization, we adopt a similar strategy by shuffling the token sequence for each image sample. Note that this does not mean that our prediction sequence is \u201corderless\u201d. By moving from fixed raster-order prediction to randomized sequence prediction, keeping all else the same, we observe 20% improvement in linear evaluation and \u223c10% in fine-tuning (Table 2 CIFAR10). Improvements on ImageNet100 are more modest (3.67% and \u223c2% respectively), but still significant and overall stochastic serialization is clearly superior. 3.2 GROUPING TOKENS INTO SEGMENTS: In this section, we introduce a concept of segments, which we define as groups (or clusters) of tokens. Effectively each segment forms an equivalency class within our serialized order, where tokens are encoded and decoded in parallel. Across segments, however, predictions are still strictly sequential. The motivation for introducing segments is two-fold. First, it allows us to reduce the overall number of autoregressive prediction steps. Second, it allows our autoregressive strategy to effectively leverage aspects of parallel, BERT-style, prediction locally. The autoregressive prediction steps can also be changed without introducing parallel prediction, simply by changing the patch size P . This is ineffective, however, as we show in Supplemental Section A.1. In what follows, we experiment with two spatially coherent segment strategies (square and blob) and then look at the importance of this spatial coherence in segment formation. Square Segments. Once we have a grid of N patches of size HP \u00d7 W P , we reshape the tokens into a set of square segments M \u00d7M , where the M denotes the size of the square. The segment count K of an image of H \u00d7 W is thus defined by: K = H\u00d7W(P\u00d7M)2 . For example, in our CIFAR10 experiment, an input image of size 32\u00d7 32 is tokenized into a grid of 8\u00d7 8 tokens, each of which is a 4\u00d7 4 pixel patch. We set the square size M = 2. The tokens are then split into (8/2)2 = 16 segments, which are shuffled randomly for autoregressive prediction as before. We list the representation quality with different square segment size (M ) in Table 3. Since the grid size is 8 \u00d7 8 for CIFAR10, we chose square sizes M = [1, 2, 4]. Note that, when M = 8, there will be only one segment (e.g., K = 1) and no prediction can be made; M = 1 is equivalent to no segments (i.e., patch-random in Table 2). Blob Segments. We define blob segments as irregular elliptical segments defined by a sampled Mixture of Gaussians. To obtain K random blobs for a given image, we first sample K Gaussians with a range of means and standard deviations in the image space. Then we simply assign each token xi which is at position (xi, yi) to the closest mixture component using Mahalanobis distance. We illustrate the square and blob strategies in Figure 2 (e) and (f), respectively. Note that beyond the shape, blob segments allow for variability in size squares do not. See details in Suppl. Section A.2. Analysis. As can be seen from Table 4, both square segments and blob segments surpass segment- patch-random square-random blob-random CF10-LIN(\u2191) 75.53 81.38 82.52 CF10-FT(\u2191) 87.52 91.38 91.53 IN100-LIN(\u2191) 53.02 64.78 65.00 IN100-FT(\u2191) 84.15 86.22 85.16 Table 4: Segments on CIFAR10. free patch-based autoregression (see square-random and blob-random compared with patch-random). The blob segments and square segments behave similarly. In addition, with blobs, we can easily modify the number of segments. However, with squares, the segment number is constrained by the token number. A grid of 8\u00d78 tokens can either be segmented into 4\u00d7 4 or 2\u00d7 2 squares. A grid size of 13\u00d7 13 can not be divided into any kind of squares. Blob segments, on the other hand, are more flexible. Do segments need to be spatially coherent? The idea of a \u201csegment\u201d puts emphasis on the spatial coherence of the tokens. The upper part of Table 5 shows the performance of feature representations with respect to the number of blob segments K. In the bottom, we randomly shuffle all tokens so that tokens in any given \u201csegment\u201d no longer spatially coherent. We observe that feature learning deteriorates when segments are not spatially coherent. Note that segments without spatial coherence are still consistently better than patch-random from Table 4. 3.3 HIERARCHICAL SEGMENT SERIALIZATION: Images are hierarchical: a visual region of an image can often be interpreted as a component of a greater whole (Hinton, 2021) (e.g., parts make up object, object scenes, and so on). Such compositionality motivates hierarchical groupings. In our case of random segment serialization, we postulate that similar hierarchical traversal order, which adds certain degree of locality, may be useful. In Figure 3 we illustrate this concept that we operationalize. An image is first partitioned into 16 square segments, indicated by different colors and shades. We then group these 16 segments into 4 larger partitions following the same logic for segment generation. Different colors (e.g., blue, orange, purple, and green) represent these partition groups; segments that share partition differ in shade. Hierarchical serialization is obtained by randomly, and sequentially, predicting the segments inside of each partition group (shown by the black arrows), and then jumping to another partition group at random. Note that the segment-level (local) and partition-level (global) serializations are both random. This idea can be extended to deeper hierarchies, with the depth of the hierarchy and grouping chosen based on the resolution and nature of the dataset. Experimental results that compare flat serialization to two-level hierarchy are illustrated in Table 6. We perform these experiments on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets. Our experiments show that hierarchical serialization and prediction consistently outperform the flat counterparts. 4 ARCHITECTURE: Image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a) performs autoregressive prediction by shifting the source sequence one pixel to the right. Since the raster ordering of iGPT is fixed for all samples, the position for the next target token is implicitly modeled by the transformer. In contrast, in RandSAC, the next token depends on the serialization strategy, thus can vary from sample to sample during training. Moreover, when predicting the next segment, the tokens within each segment should be predicted jointly (in parallel). This requires lateral pathways that allow communication within target segments. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose to utilize the transformer decoder. 4.1 MASKED TRANSFORMER FOR SEGMENT PREDICTION: A standard transformer has an encoder-decoder structure (Vaswani et al., 2017). The encoder of a transformer maps a list of tokens X = (x1, ...,xn) to a sequence of hidden representations Z = (z1, ..., zn), also known as the memory. Given X and source sequence Xsrc = (x1, ...,xn\u22121), during training, the decoder masks the internal attention matrix with a causal mask and predicts the target sequence Xtgt = (x2, ...,xn) autoregressively. Each layer of the transformer encoder has two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a fully connected feed-forward network; both have residual connections. The decoder layer has a third attention sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention from the hidden representation Z to the target representation Xtgt. We leverage attention masking to achieve autoregressive segment prediction using this framework; we discuss details next. Autoregressive Segment Encoder. Figure 4 shows our transformer encoder block and a decoder block. We leave out the fully connected layer and residual connections for simplicity and only show the attentions. In this visualization, there are six patches. These six patches are then grouped into three segments denoted by colors: green, blue, and red. The random segment serialization order is green \u2192 blue \u2192 red. One layer of transformer encoder is illustrated on the left in light green. Serialized six patches/tokens with added fixed sine-cosine positional encoding are the input to the encoder. The encoder attention is masked following the serialized segment order: segments can attend to themselves and preceding segments only. They are restricted from looking at future seg- ments using the, illustrated, source mask. Lastly, since the last segment does not have a succeeding segment, we only input the first four patches and leave out the two patches in the last segment. Autoregressive Segment Decoder. The input for the transformer decoder, illustrated on the right of Figure 4 in pink, is a set of fixed positional encodings to guide the reconstruction of target segments and tokens. Similar to the encoder input where we leave out the last segment patches, in the decoder, we shift the target sequence one segment to the left and ignore the positional encodings of the first segment because it does not have a preceding segment. The self-attention layer of the decoder is masked the same way as the encoder for autoregressive segment decoding. This layer enables co-attention over preceding and current segments for context. Evaluation. During linear evaluation and fine-tuning, both the attention masks and decoder are removed, and the encoder is used as feature extractor for the downstream supervised classification. 4.2 TRAINABLE SKIP CONNECTIONS: The original transformer decoder layer can only attend to the same encoder output, often from the last layer of the encoder. In contrast, CNN encoder-decoder architectures are often symmetric with skip connections between encoder and decoder layers, e.g., UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015). We hypothesize that in our design, skip-connections between transformer encoder and decoder can similarly be beneficial. To enable such skip connections, we propose a trainable skip connection module that learns how to assign encoder memory to the decoder layers. Specifically, for a transformer with Lenc and Ldec number of layers, we learn a linear layer with parameters W \u2208 RLenc\u00d7Ldec , such that: Zl = \u2211Lenc k=1 Wl,kH k enc, where H k enc is an encoder representation from layer k and Z l is the formed memory for decoder layer l. Note, the linearly formed memory cells are conditioned on, and different, for each individual decoder layer. We refer the reader to the Supplemental Section A.3 for details and experiments that validate the effectiveness of this design and discuss efficiency. 5 EXPERIMENTS: We test RandSAC in two drastically different settings: low-data and ImageNet-1K pre-training. We evaluate the classification performance of our pretrained backbone with linear probing and finetuning. We also test the transfer learning ability of our ImageNet pretrained model (Suppl. Sec. D.3). General Implementation Details. We adopt minimal data augmentation strategy and use the normalized pixel value from (He et al., 2021) as our patch regression target. We obtain the reconstruction target by normalizing target pixels using the mean and standard deviation of the patch they belong. Our loss function computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted pixel values and patch-normalized reconstruction target. Low-data Pretraining. Vision transformers are known to be \u201cdata hungry\u201d (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and require a large dataset and a series of data augmentations to pretrain (Touvron et al., 2021). To experiment in such a challenging setting, we evaluate our method on small-scale datasets. We train a \u201csquare\u201d and \u201cblob\u201d RandSAC models using 16\u2192 4 and 11\u2192 5 hierarchies respectively. Pretraining on ImageNet-1K. ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 (Deng et al., 2009) is a popular large scale image dataset with 1.28 million images and 1000 categories. We train \u201csquare\u201d RandSAC (16\u2192 4). Detailed implementation details for all three settings are given in Supplemental Appendix B. 5.1 EVALUATION PROTOCOLS: Linear Probing. This measure is widely used for quantifying the quality of representation learning. It learns a linear classifier on top of the frozen feature of a pretrained encoder to classify the objectlevel classification labels. Then performance is evaluated using the val/test set. End-to-end Fine-tuning. A recent study (Chen et al., 2022) shows that linear evaluation favors those methods with a center-bias such as contrastive learning. To complement linear probing, we also include 100-epoch fine-tuning evaluation. In fine-tuning, all parameters are optimized for classification. The fine-tuning recipe follows the common practice of supervised ViT training. 5.2 RESULTS Table 7 shows low-data classification performance for contrastive pretraining (DINO (Caron et al., 2021)), masked image encoding (MAE (He et al., 2021)) and our segment autoregressive coding (RandSAC). The MAE and DINO are pretrained using their official implementations. For MAE we use a 75% masking ratio as suggested in their paper. All models\u00b7 are pretrained for 1600 epochs and evaluated with both 90-epoch linear probing (LIN) and 100-epoch fine-tuning (FT). Under the low data benchmark, RandSAC outperforms other non-autoregressive algorithms and direct supervised training, by a large margin. Both the square and the blob hierarchical versions work well. We postulate that the superior performance of RandSAC comes from randomized segment prediction pretext task. The autoregressive coding objective that we propose, which is to traverse a hierarchy of randomly serialized visual segments, diversifies the small dataset, and serves as a sort of data augmentation. Table 8 shows ImageNet pretraining result. We compare RandSAC with contrastive transformer training approaches (DINO (Caron et al., 2021) & MoCo v3 (Chen et al., 2021b)), masked image encoding (BEIT (Bao et al., 2022) & MAE (He et al., 2021)), and our autoregressive counterpart iGPT (Chen et al., 2020a). We note, that due to limited access to computation, we were only able to run RandSAC once, without any parameter tuning. Nevertheless, RandSAC outperforms all predictive (non-contrastive methods) in linear probing, despite using a smaller image size for pretraining (192 vs 224). It is also among the best in fine-tuning (on par with MAE and better than the rest). Contrastive models do tend to perform better in linear probing, but also differ in pre-training. For example, contrastive methods require two global crops of the input image while other methods only process one crop; DINO uses 10 local crops. In addition, linear probing for DINO and iGPT is evaluated using the last 4 and 5 transformer blocks, respectively, while MoCo v3, MAE, and RandSAC only evaluate the last block output. A longer feature vector tends to result in better linear probing accuracy (Caron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a). Lastly, it is worth mentioning that RandSAC can be easily combined with contrastive objectives in the future. 6 CONCLUSION: We present a new self-supervised pre-training strategy we call RandSAC. In doing so, we also study and provide general insights into ViT pre-training (e.g., tokenization, segmentation, and serialization). We found randomized serialization of hierarchical image segments significantly improves autoregressive pre-training of ViTs. In addition, we propose a new design for the transformer decoder, which facilitates improved performance. We show evidence that the proposed task and model could be the key to developing a powerful GPT-like model for visual representation learning. A APPENDIX: A.1 EFFECT OF PATCH SIZE 1\u00d7 1 2\u00d7 2 4\u00d7 4 8\u00d7 8 16\u00d7 16 LIN(\u2191) 59.79 69.63 75.53 75.34 60.77 FT(\u2191) 79.70 87.18 87.52 83.10 69.23 Table 9: Patch-random tokenization as a function of P on CIFAR10. As we discuss in the main paper (Section 3.2), the control (mainly reduction) over the number of autoregressive steps can be achieved by simply varying the patch size P in the patch-random model. The result of this on CIFAR10 are illustrated in Table 9. It can clearly be seen that a different patch size P does not lead to improved representation for a segment-free patch-random prediction task. The segment formation, on the other hand, as we show in the paper, does substantially improve the performance. A.2 BLOB SEGMENTS.: We define blob segments as irregular elliptical segments defined by a sampled Mixture of Gaussians. To obtainK random blobs for a given image, we first sampleK Gaussians with means sampled from [\u00b5 (x) k , \u00b5 (y) k ] \u223c U(\u22121.75, 1.75) and standard deviations from [\u03c3 (x) k , \u03c3 (y) k ] \u223c U(0.5, 1), where U is a uniform distribution. Then we simply assign each token xi which is at a normalized position (xi, yi) in the range of [\u22122, 2] (i.e., leftmost top token is at (-2,-2), rightmost bottom token is at (2,2)). The assignment is done as follows: S(xi) = argmax k N ([ xi yi ] | [ \u00b5 (x) k \u00b5 (y) k ] , [ \u03c3 (x) k 0 0 \u03c3 (y) k ]2) . (1) S is a function that maps tokens to segments. The sampling for both square and blob is only used during segment predictive training and is disabled during evaluation. The computation cost for sampling is, comparatively, negligible. Note that beyond the shape, blob segments allow for variability in size squares do not. A.3 TRAINABLE SKIP CONNECTIONS: We define a transformer design, with learnable skip connections, that we leverage for our main experiments in Section 4.2 of the main paper. Here we provide additional details and evaluation of that design which is illustrated in Figure 5 (right). A transformer with Lenc encoder layers and Ldec decoder layers processes input X into Lenc hidden representations Hlenc = (h l 1, ...,h l n). In traditional masked transformer, decoder memory is set to Zl = HLencenc for each layer l of the decoder. Instead, we introduce a linear attention layer that allows each decoder layer to attend over encoding hidden representations. In other words, we learn a linear layer with parameters W \u2208 RLenc\u00d7Ldec , such that: Zl = \u2211Lenc k=1 Wl,kH k enc. Note, the linearly combined memory cells are conditioned on, and different, for each individual decoder layer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Masked Transformer and trainable skip connection layer for segment prediction, we compare three architectures: Two-stream Transformer. This design was proposed in (Yang et al., 2019) for permutation-based language modeling. It enables randomized target predictions by leveraging a two-stream attention layer: the content stream encodes the full contextual information, and the query stream, which only has access to the previous content, is designed to make current predictions. We apply this architecture for our segment prediction by setting the content mask with our \u201csource mask\u201d and query mask with our \u201cmemory mask\u201d. Model weights for both content stream and query stream are shared (see Figure 5 (left) for illustration of design). Masked Transformer. For masked transformer we utilize architecture described in Section 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4; also in Figure 5 (middle). Compared with the Two-stream Transformer above, this design enables communication among jointly predicted tokens within a segment. Also, compared with Two-stream Transformer, weights for encoding and decoding the segment content are decoupled in the Masked Transformer. Masked Transformer with Trainable Skip Connections. A Masked Transformer only decodes based on the (last layer) encoder output. A trainable skip connection layer we introduce dynamically allocates memory assignments between intermediate layers of transformer-encoder-decoder (see Figure 5 (right)). As can be seen from the results in Table 10, this variant does outperform the two competitors on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets. Compared with Masked Transformer, the additional computation cost introduced by trainable linear layer is almost negligible (Table 11). B EXPERIMENTS:  B.1 SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION ON ADE20K.: We take our pretrained backbone as initialization and end-to-end fine-tune with UpperNet framework on ADE20k to evaluate the performance of our pretrained model on downstream task, semantic segmentation. We follow the same setting of BeiT (Bao et al., 2022). We compare our pre-training with DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), MoCo (Chen et al., 2021b), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and BeiT (Bao et al., 2022) in Table 12. Our pre-training outperform DeiT, MoCo, DINO, BeiT by 1.0, 0.8, 0.8 and 1.5, respectively. B.2 VISUALIZATION OF RECONSTRUCTION ON IMAGENET-1K VALIDATION SET B.3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We describe implementation details omitted from the main paper due to space limitations here. Implementation Details. We adopt minimal data augmentation strategy following (He et al., 2021): resize cropping with scale range of [0.2, 1.0] and aspect ratio is sampled within range [ 34 , 4 3 ], followed by a 50% chance random horizontal flipping. We do not use color jittering, path dropping, or gradient clip in pretraining. We use AdamW as optimizer and pretrain RandSAC for 1600 epochs. We use a linear lr scaling rule (Goyal et al., 2017) that scales the base lr by batchsize/256. The lr is scheduled to warm-up from 0 to base lr, then decayed following a cosine-decay rule (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016). For both benchmarks, we use the normalized pixel loss introduced from (He et al., 2021) as our patch regression target. Our loss function computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the patch-normalized reconstruction and original image pixels. B.4 EVALUATION PROTOCOLS: Linear Probing. Note that the dimension of the feature that the classifier is trained on, may influence the eventual accuracy readout (Caron et al., 2021). A longer feature vector is likely to produce a better linear result. Prior works such as (Caron et al., 2021) concatenate the feature vectors from the last 4 ViT blocks and (Chen et al., 2020a) use feature vectors up to 15360 dimensions for evaluation. We, however, use only the last encoder averaged feature output following (He et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021b) (i.e., 384 dimensions for ViT-S and 768 dimensions for ViT-B). The linear classifier is trained for 90 epochs. C DETAILS FOR SECTION 3:  C.1 PRE-TRAINING SETTINGS FOR CIFAR10 AND IMAGENET100: The following is the experiment configurations for CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 from Section 3 of the main paper, including Table 9 and 10 in Appendix. Details for end-to-end fine-tuning and linear probing are the same with ImageNet-1K. For Table 10, both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 experiments are trained using a \u201cBlob\u201d RandSAC model using hierarchy 11\u21925. C.1.1 CIFAR10 EXPERIMENTS.: The default setting is illustrated in Table 13. We pre-train ViT-Tiny encoder on CIFAR10. The ViTTiny has 12 layers. Each layer has 192 dimensions and 3 self-attention heads. We chose patch size 4 \u00d7 4 and split the 32 \u00d7 32 images into 8 \u00d7 8 tokens. For segment decoding, we use 3 transformer decoder layers following the same configuration for the encoder. C.1.2 IMAGENET100 EXPERIMENTS. Experiments that involve ImageNet100 are Table 2, 4, 6 and 10. We pre-train ViT-Small encoder on ImageNet100 (Tian et al., 2020). The ViT-Small backbone has 12 layers. Each layer has 384 dimensions and 6 self-attention heads. We chose patch size 16 \u00d7 16 following (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and split the 224\u00d7 224 images into 14\u00d7 14 tokens. For segment decoding, we use a 4 layer transformer decoder and double the attention heads while keeping all other configurations the same as the ViT-Small encoder. D DETAILS FOR SECTION 4:  D.1 LOW-DATA PRE-TRAINING SETTING: We pre-train ViT-Small on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2009). Both datasets are smallscale image datasets containing 60000 32\u00d7 32 images that belong to 10 and 100 categories, respectively. The ViT-Small has 12 layers. Each layer has 384 dimensions and 6 self-attention heads. We chose patch size 4 \u00d7 4 and split the 32 \u00d7 32 images into 8 \u00d7 8 tokens. For segment decoding, we use a 6 transformer decoder layer. The attention-head and feature dimensions of the decoder are the same as the encoder. We also set the decoder for MAE (He et al., 2021) to have the same depth, attention head, and dimension as ours. D.2 IMAGENET-1K PRE-TRAINING SETTING We resize the images to 192 \u00d7 192 during pretraining and set patch size P to be 16. We pretrain square-RandSAC with hierarchy 16 \u21924 using ViT-Base (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) on ImageNet1K following (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021). ViT-Base model has 12 blocks, with each block having dimension 768 and 12 heads. We chose an 8 layer decoder. The attention-head and feature dimensions of the decoder are the same as the encoder. D.3 EVALUATION CONFIGURATIONS: Different from ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), where an additional class token is required for classification, we directly use the averaged pooled feature out of the encoder for both fine-tuning and linear probing. The hyper-parameters for both end-to-end finetuning and linear probing from Table 17 and Table 18 are used for all experiments of this paper. E IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION We end-to-end fine-tune our pre-trained ViT encoder with UpperNet framework on ADE20k to evaluate the performance on downstream task, semantic segmentation. We follow the same setting of BeiT (Bao et al., 2022).

We introduce contrastive random lead coding (CRLC), where random subsets of the input channels are used to create positive pairs and compare with using augmentations and neighboring segments in time as positive pairs. We validate our approach by pre-training models on EEG and ECG data, and then fine-tuning them for downstream tasks.

It attempts to bridge concepts from natural language processing (NLP) and generative modeling into the domain of vision self-supervision, moving beyond the current dominant paradigms.\\n\\nHere's a detailed review focusing on its novelty and technical contributions:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review of \\\"Self-supervision through Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC)\\\"**\\n\\n**1. Paper Summary:**\\nRandSAC proposes a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike typical masked autoencoders (MAEs) which reconstruct randomly masked *individual patches* in parallel, or contrastive methods that focus on global feature alignment, RandSAC aims to learn rich visual representations by performing *autoregressive prediction* of *randomly sampled spatial segments* of an image. This approach encourages the model to understand intermediate-level spatial dependencies and hierarchical structures within images.\\n\\n**2. Core Idea and Motivation:**\\nThe fundamental motivation behind RandSAC stems from an observation that while patch-level reconstruction (MAE) is highly effective, it might not explicitly capture the more complex, higher-order relationships between groups of patches that form semantically meaningful segments or objects. Similarly, global-level contrastive learning (DINO, SimCLR) focuses on entire image semantics but might miss fine-grained structural understanding.\\n\\nRandSAC addresses this gap by:\\n*   **Moving beyond individual patches:** It operates on \\\"segments,\\\" which are contiguous or semantically meaningful collections of patches. This forces the model to reason about local to mid-range spatial coherence.\\n*   **Introducing autoregressive coding:** This is the most significant departure from existing methods. Instead of reconstructing all masked parts simultaneously, RandSAC predicts segments sequentially, conditioned on previously observed/predicted segments. This is analogous to language models predicting the next word/token based on prior context. This mechanism inherently encourages learning of conditional probabilities and structural dependencies within the visual input.\\n\\nThe underlying hypothesis is that by forcing the model to predict *what comes next* in terms of visual segments, it will learn a deeper understanding of image composition, object parts, and spatial relationships, leading to more robust and semantically rich representations.\\n\\n**3. Technical Breakdown and Contributions:**\\n\\n**a. Random Segment Definition and Sampling:**\\n*   **Novelty:** This is a crucial first step. Most vision models operate on fixed-size patches. RandSAC introduces the idea of *random segments*. This implies a flexible definition:\\n    *   **How segments are defined:** Are they random rectangular crops? Clusters of semantically similar patches? Superpixels? The \\\"random\\\" aspect likely implies variability in size, shape, and location to ensure diverse learning signals. A key technical challenge and contribution here is how to effectively sample and represent these varying segments for a ViT.\\n    *   **Contrast to MAE:** MAE masks *individual* patches. RandSAC masks *groups* of patches that form a segment. This changes the nature of the prediction task from simple pixel/feature infilling to coherent segment generation.\\n\\n**b. Autoregressive Coding for 2D Data:**\\n*   **Novelty:** This is the heart of RandSAC's innovation for vision. Autoregressive models are standard in NLP and generative image models (e.g., VQ-VAE, PixelRNN/CNN), but their application to *self-supervised representation learning* for vision is distinct:\\n    *   **The \\\"Ordering Problem\\\":** Images are inherently 2D and lack a natural, universally accepted sequential order (unlike text). RandSAC must address this.\\n        *   **Potential Solutions (as implied by \\\"Autoregressive Coding\\\"):**\\n            *   **Fixed Raster Scan:** A simple approach, but might impose an artificial bias.\\n            *   **Learned Order/Permutation Invariance:** More complex, but could be powerful. Perhaps the model predicts the \\\"next\\\" segment based on some learned saliency or spatial proximity, or processes segments in a random order but still conditions each prediction on previously \\\"generated\\\" information.\\n            *   **Implicit Conditioning:** The decoder takes as input the encoded visible segments *and* potentially feature representations of previously predicted segments, iteratively refining the image.\\n    *   **The Decoder Architecture:** Unlike MAE's simple shallow decoder that processes all masked tokens in parallel, RandSAC would likely employ a more sophisticated, potentially recurrent or transformer-based decoder that predicts one segment at a time, incorporating feedback from previous predictions.\\n    *   **Prediction Target:** Instead of reconstructing raw pixels, RandSAC likely predicts high-level feature representations of the masked segments (e.g., the features from a pre-trained teacher network, or the ground-truth encoder features). This makes the task more abstract and semantic.\\n\\n**c. Loss Function:**\\n*   The primary loss would likely be a reconstruction loss (e.g., L1 or L2) between the predicted segment features and the actual features of the ground-truth masked segment. This loss would be applied iteratively for each predicted segment in the autoregressive sequence.\\n\\n**d. Efficiency:**\\n*   Similar to MAE, if RandSAC employs a high masking ratio for segments (i.e., a large portion of the image is masked out in segments), the encoder would operate only on a sparse set of visible segments, leading to computational efficiency during pre-training. The autoregressive decoding might add some complexity, but overall, it aims to be efficient compared to full image processing.\\n\\n**4. Novelty & Technical Contributions Summarized:**\\n\\n1.  **Segment-Level Self-Supervision:** A novel intermediate level of abstraction (between patch and global) for SSL, focusing on coherent spatial regions. This is a significant conceptual shift from existing paradigms.\\n2.  **Autoregressive Modeling for Vision SSL:** The most prominent technical contribution. Applying the principles of sequence generation (common in NLP) to learn visual representations by predicting conditional relationships between image segments. This is distinct from parallel reconstruction (MAE) or contrastive/distillation methods.\\n3.  **Implicit Inductive Bias for Structure:** By forcing sequential prediction, RandSAC inherently introduces an inductive bias towards understanding image composition, part-whole relationships, and spatial context, which could lead to representations that are more semantically grounded and robust.\\n4.  **Flexible Segment Definition:** The \\\"random segments\\\" concept implies a dynamic way of partitioning images, allowing for diverse learning signals and potentially capturing multi-scale information without explicit multi-scale architectures.\\n\\n**5. Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Richer Representations:** Potentially learns more semantically meaningful and structured representations due to the focus on segment relationships and conditional prediction.\\n*   **Stronger Inductive Bias:** The autoregressive nature provides a powerful inductive bias for sequential dependencies and compositionality, which are inherent in natural images.\\n*   **Generative Understanding:** Encourages the model to learn a deeper generative model of image data, rather than just discriminative features or simple reconstruction.\\n*   **Potential for Better Transfer:** Representations learned this way might transfer exceptionally well to tasks requiring fine-grained understanding, object detection, or segmentation, where understanding spatial relationships is critical.\\n\\n**6. Weaknesses/Limitations (and anticipated challenges):**\\n\\n*   **The \\\"Ordering Problem\\\" in 2D:** This is the most significant technical hurdle. How does RandSAC define the prediction order for image segments without imposing an artificial and potentially detrimental bias? The paper's solution to this will be key to its success.\\n*   **Computational Complexity of Autoregressive Decoding:** While encoding might be efficient with high masking, autoregressive decoding can be computationally more intensive than parallel decoding, especially if it involves many steps.\\n*   **Sensitivity to Segment Definition:** The quality and diversity of the \\\"random segments\\\" will heavily influence the learned representations. Poor segment sampling could lead to suboptimal learning.\\n*   **Training Stability:** Autoregressive models can sometimes be trickier to train than parallel ones due to error propagation.\\n\\n**7. Potential Impact and Future Directions:**\\n\\nRandSAC has the potential to significantly impact the field of self-supervised learning for vision:\\n\\n*   **New SSL Paradigm:** It could establish a new paradigm for generative SSL that combines the efficiency of masking with the semantic richness of autoregressive modeling.\\n*   **Improved Vision Foundation Models:** If successful, it could yield significantly better pre-trained ViT models, leading to higher performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, especially those requiring detailed spatial understanding.\\n*   **Applications:** Particularly impactful for domains like robotics (understanding object manipulation), medical imaging (analyzing anatomical structures), or autonomous driving (perceiving complex scene layouts and object parts).\\n*   **Future Research:**\\n    *   Exploring more sophisticated, learned, or semantic-aware segment definitions.\\n    *   Investigating different autoregressive strategies for 2D data (e.g., non-causal dependencies, attention-based ordering).\\n    *   Combining RandSAC's autoregressive objective with other SSL objectives (e.g., contrastive learning on segment embeddings).\\n    *   Extending to video by incorporating temporal segments.\\n\\n**8. Overall Assessment:**\\n\\nRandSAC represents a bold and highly novel step forward in self-supervised learning for vision. By introducing the concept of autoregressive prediction of random spatial segments, it directly tackles the challenge of learning intermediate-level spatial coherence and hierarchical structure in images, which is largely underexplored by current state-of-the-art methods. Its success will hinge on robust solutions to the \\\"ordering problem\\\" for 2D data and efficient segment definition. If these technical challenges are overcome effectively, RandSAC could indeed become a new benchmark, yielding richer and more semantically meaningful representations for Vision Transformers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with self-supervision.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.98861995\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper, focusing on the novelty and technical contributions.

How is its context window defined?\\n        *   What is the input and output representation for the autoregressive model (raw pixels, encoded features)?\\n        *   What is the specific loss function used for the autoregressive task (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy, perceptual loss)?\\n    *   **Integration:** How do the \\\"random segments\\\" and \\\"autoregressive coding\\\" interact? Is the autoregressive task applied *within* segments, *across* a sequence of segments, or both? This integration needs to be explicitly detailed and justified.\\n\\n2.  **Theoretical Justification/Motivation:**\\n    *   Why should \\\"random segments with autoregressive coding\\\" lead to better representations than existing SSL methods?\\n    *   What specific invariances or properties is RandSAC hypothesized to learn? (e.g., robustness to occlusion, understanding of sequence, spatial context).\\n    *   How does it address known limitations of current SSL paradigms (e.g., collapse for contrastive methods, computational cost for generative models)?\\n\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:**\\n    *   Critical hyperparameters related to segment generation (e.g., segment size range, randomness intensity, number of segments).\\n    *   Critical hyperparameters for the autoregressive model (e.g., context length, model capacity, training schedule).\\n    *   A thorough analysis showing the robustness or sensitivity to these parameters is essential.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Areas for Improvement: Experimental Design**\\n\\n1.  **Comprehensive Baselines:**\\n    *   **State-of-the-Art SSL Methods:** Compare RandSAC against a diverse set of leading SSL techniques on the *same backbone architecture* (e.g., ResNet-50, ViT-B/16) and *same pre-training data* (e.g., ImageNet-1K). This should include:\\n        *   Contrastive methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo v3, BYOL, Barlow Twins).\\n        *   Masked Autoencoding methods (e.g., MAE, BEiT, SimMIM).\\n        *   Other relevant segment-based or sequence-based SSL methods if they exist.\\n    *   **Ablation Baselines:** This is crucial to isolate the contribution of each component of RandSAC.\\n        *   **\\\"Random Segments\\\" without Autoregression:** E.g., a simple contrastive loss applied to randomly sampled segments, or a reconstruction task on segments. This tests if the \\\"random segments\\\" alone are beneficial.\\n        *   **Autoregression without \\\"Random Segments\\\":** E.g., standard pixel-level or feature-level autoregressive prediction on full images/data, or fixed-grid segments. This tests if the \\\"randomness\\\" is necessary.\\n        *   **Simpler Segment Selection:** Compare \\\"random\\\" segments against fixed-grid, salient-region, or other segment selection strategies.\\n    *   **Supervised Baseline:** A fully supervised model trained on the downstream task to provide an upper bound reference.\\n\\n2.  **Diverse Downstream Tasks and Datasets:**\\n    *   **Image Classification:** ImageNet-1K linear probing and fine-tuning are standard. However, also include transfer learning to other domains/datasets (e.g., Places365, iNaturalist, Pascal VOC) to demonstrate generalizability of learned representations.\\n    *   **Object Detection/Segmentation:** Evaluate on datasets like COCO or Pascal VOC to show the utility of representations for tasks beyond classification.\\n    *   **Other Modalities (if applicable):** If RandSAC is claimed to be general, test on video (action recognition), audio (speech command recognition), or even text (if \\\"segments\\\" can be adapted).\\n\\n3.  **Fair Comparison and Reproducibility:**\\n    *   **Pre-training Epochs/Time:** Ensure all methods are pre-trained for comparable amounts of time or epochs. If RandSAC requires significantly more resources, this should be explicitly discussed.\\n    *   **Backbone Architecture:** All comparisons should use the *exact same* backbone and pre-training data size.\\n    *   **Evaluation Protocol:** Consistent evaluation metrics (e.g., top-1 accuracy for classification, mAP for detection) and evaluation setups (e.g., same number of fine-tuning epochs, same optimizer).\\n    *   **Statistical Significance:** Report means and standard deviations over multiple runs with different random seeds, especially for smaller differences in performance.\\n    *   **Open-Source Code:** Providing code, pre-trained weights, and detailed hyperparameters is essential for reproducibility and community validation.\\n\\n4.  **Computational Efficiency Analysis:**\\n    *   Compare training time, memory footprint, and inference speed of RandSAC against baselines. Is it significantly more or less computationally demanding? This affects practicality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Areas for Improvement: Validity of Claims & Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Quantitative vs. Qualitative Claims:**\\n    *   Any claims of \\\"state-of-the-art,\\\" \\\"robustness,\\\" or \\\"efficiency\\\" must be strongly supported by quantitative results from the aforementioned comprehensive experiments.\\n    *   Avoid over-claiming based on limited experiments or only linear probing results. Fine-tuning and transfer learning results are often more indicative of true representation quality.\\n\\n2.  **In-depth Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   Beyond the baseline ablations, detailed studies on:\\n        *   The impact of varying the *degree* of randomness in segment generation.\\n        *   The specific choice of autoregressive model (e.g., why a Transformer over an RNN for this task?).\\n        *   The contribution of different components of the loss function.\\n        *   The effect of different segment sizes or segment counts.\\n        *   The influence of the pre-training dataset size on performance.\\n\\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis and Interpretability:**\\n    *   **Visualization of Learned Features:** Use techniques like t-SNE or UMAP to visualize the embedding space of learned representations, showing how clusters form for different classes.\\n    *   **Activation Maps (e.g., Grad-CAM):** Show what parts of an image the model focuses on after RandSAC pre-training, to demonstrate if it learns semantically relevant features.\\n    *   **Reconstruction/Prediction Examples:** If the autoregressive task involves reconstruction or prediction of visual content, show examples of the model's outputs to illustrate what it's learning.\\n    *   **Failure Analysis:** Discuss cases where RandSAC performs poorly and hypothesize why, suggesting avenues for future work.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\n\\\"RandSAC\\\" presents an intriguing approach to self-supervised learning.

Let's break down its potential impact, broader implications, limitations, and future directions.\\n\\nThe core idea seems to be:\\n1.  **Self-supervision:** Learning representations from unlabeled data.\\n2.  **Random Segments:** Focusing on local or partial views of the input data (e.g., image patches, video clips, audio snippets, text spans). This is common in SSL (e.g., masked autoencoders, patch-based contrastive learning).\\n3.  **Autoregressive Coding:** Applying an autoregressive model (like those used in language modeling or generative image modeling) to learn representations *within* or *across* these segments. This suggests predicting future elements based on past ones, or generating/reconstructing segments in a sequential manner.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Potential Impact on the Field\\n\\n1.  **Novel Pretext Task Paradigm:** While masked prediction (MAE, BEiT) and contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo, DINO) dominate SSL, RandSAC introduces a distinct mechanism. By combining \\\"random segments\\\" (local focus, robustness to partial views) with \\\"autoregressive coding\\\" (sequential prediction, capturing dependencies), it might unlock a new way to learn rich, structured representations.\\n2.  **Enhanced Local Feature Learning:** Focusing on random segments forces the model to learn robust features from incomplete or diverse local contexts. Autoregressive coding within these segments could help the model understand the internal structure and dependencies of these local parts, leading to more granular and context-aware feature learning than methods that might only focus on global features or simple masking.\\n3.  **Potential for Stronger Transferability:** If RandSAC effectively learns both local patterns and their sequential relationships, the pre-trained models could exhibit superior performance when fine-tuned on downstream tasks that require fine-grained understanding or sequential reasoning (e.g., object detection with occlusions, action recognition in video, medical image analysis, dense prediction tasks).\\n4.  **Applicability Across Modalities:** The concept of \\\"segments\\\" and \\\"autoregressive coding\\\" is highly generalizable.\\n    *   **Vision:** Image patches, video frames/clips.\\n    *   **Audio:** Sound snippets, spectrogram segments.\\n    *   **Text:** Word/subword sequences (though established autoregressive models exist, applying the \\\"random segments\\\" concept in a novel way could be interesting).\\n    It could pave the way for more unified SSL frameworks across different data types.\\n5.  **Addressing Limitations of Current SSL:**\\n    *   **Contrastive Learning's drawbacks:** Reduced need for negative pairs (which can be hard to manage for large datasets or complex features) or reliance on specific augmentation strategies.\\n    *   **Masked Modeling's limitations:** While powerful, MAE/BEiT primarily learn through reconstruction. RandSAC's autoregressive nature might capture different types of dependencies and predictive power.\\n\\n### Broader Implications\\n\\n1.  **Reduced Data Labeling Burden:** As with all effective SSL methods, RandSAC contributes to the paradigm of learning from vast amounts of unlabeled data, significantly reducing the reliance on costly and time-consuming manual data annotation. This democratizes AI development for resource-constrained domains or languages/modalities with limited labeled datasets.\\n2.  **More Robust AI Systems:** Learning from \\\"random segments\\\" inherently trains models to be more robust to partial information, occlusions, noise, and varying contexts. This is crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving, robotics, medical diagnostics (where images might be noisy or incomplete), and surveillance.\\n3.  **Foundation for Generative AI:** Autoregressive models are at the heart of many powerful generative models. If RandSAC effectively learns latent representations through autoregressive coding, it could serve as a strong pre-training step for subsequent generative tasks (e.g., generating missing segments, synthesizing new content).\\n4.  **Resource Efficiency (Potentially):** If RandSAC can achieve competitive performance with less computational cost (e.g., fewer large batches for contrastive learning, or less complex masking strategies), it could make high-quality representation learning more accessible. However, autoregressive models can also be computationally intensive.\\n5.  **New Research Avenues for Understanding Intelligence:** Understanding how models learn from sequential prediction within local contexts could provide insights into human perception and learning, which often relies on processing partial, sequential information to build a complete understanding.\\n\\n### Potential Limitations\\n\\n1.  **Computational Overhead:** Autoregressive models, especially for high-dimensional data like images or video, can be computationally expensive due to their sequential nature (dependencies between predictions) and the need to process many segments. Training time and memory footprint could be significant.\\n2.  **Complexity of Segment Definition:** How are \\\"random segments\\\" defined? Are they fixed-size patches, variable-length clips, or something else? The choice could significantly impact performance and might be highly sensitive to hyperparameters.\\n3.  **Lack of Global Context:** While learning from segments is good for local features, an over-reliance on purely local information might prevent the model from learning strong global structural relationships or long-range dependencies that are crucial for some tasks.

It attempts to bridge concepts from natural language processing (NLP) and generative modeling into the domain of vision self-supervision, moving beyond the current dominant paradigms.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed review focusing on its novelty and technical contributions:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review of \"Self-supervision through Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC)\"**\\n\\n**1. Paper Summary:**\\nRandSAC proposes a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike typical masked autoencoders (MAEs) which reconstruct randomly masked *individual patches* in parallel, or contrastive methods that focus on global feature alignment, RandSAC aims to learn rich visual representations by performing *autoregressive prediction* of *randomly sampled spatial segments* of an image. This approach encourages the model to understand intermediate-level spatial dependencies and hierarchical structures within images.\\n\\n**2. Core Idea and Motivation:**\\nThe fundamental motivation behind RandSAC stems from an observation that while patch-level reconstruction (MAE) is highly effective, it might not explicitly capture the more complex, higher-order relationships between groups of patches that form semantically meaningful segments or objects. Similarly, global-level contrastive learning (DINO, SimCLR) focuses on entire image semantics but might miss fine-grained structural understanding.\\n\\nRandSAC addresses this gap by:\\n*   **Moving beyond individual patches:** It operates on \"segments,\" which are contiguous or semantically meaningful collections of patches. This forces the model to reason about local to mid-range spatial coherence.\\n*   **Introducing autoregressive coding:** This is the most significant departure from existing methods. Instead of reconstructing all masked parts simultaneously, RandSAC predicts segments sequentially, conditioned on previously observed/predicted segments. This is analogous to language models predicting the next word/token based on prior context. This mechanism inherently encourages learning of conditional probabilities and structural dependencies within the visual input.\\n\\nThe underlying hypothesis is that by forcing the model to predict *what comes next* in terms of visual segments, it will learn a deeper understanding of image composition, object parts, and spatial relationships, leading to more robust and semantically rich representations.\\n\\n**3. Technical Breakdown and Contributions:**\\n\\n**a. Random Segment Definition and Sampling:**\\n*   **Novelty:** This is a crucial first step. Most vision models operate on fixed-size patches. RandSAC introduces the idea of *random segments*. This implies a flexible definition:\\n    *   **How segments are defined:** Are they random rectangular crops? Clusters of semantically similar patches? Superpixels? The \"random\" aspect likely implies variability in size, shape, and location to ensure diverse learning signals. A key technical challenge and contribution here is how to effectively sample and represent these varying segments for a ViT.\\n    *   **Contrast to MAE:** MAE masks *individual* patches. RandSAC masks *groups* of patches that form a segment. This changes the nature of the prediction task from simple pixel/feature infilling to coherent segment generation.\\n\\n**b. Autoregressive Coding for 2D Data:**\\n*   **Novelty:** This is the heart of RandSAC\\'s innovation for vision. Autoregressive models are standard in NLP and generative image models (e.g., VQ-VAE, PixelRNN/CNN), but their application to *self-supervised representation learning* for vision is distinct:\\n    *   **The \"Ordering Problem\":** Images are inherently 2D and lack a natural, universally accepted sequential order (unlike text). RandSAC must address this.\\n        *   **Potential Solutions (as implied by \"Autoregressive Coding\"):**\\n            *   **Fixed Raster Scan:** A simple approach, but might impose an artificial bias.\\n            *   **Learned Order/Permutation Invariance:** More complex, but could be powerful. Perhaps the model predicts the \"next\" segment based on some learned saliency or spatial proximity, or processes segments in a random order but still conditions each prediction on previously \"generated\" information.\\n            *   **Implicit Conditioning:** The decoder takes as input the encoded visible segments *and* potentially feature representations of previously predicted segments, iteratively refining the image.\\n    *   **The Decoder Architecture:** Unlike MAE\\'s simple shallow decoder that processes all masked tokens in parallel, RandSAC would likely employ a more sophisticated, potentially recurrent or transformer-based decoder that predicts one segment at a time, incorporating feedback from previous predictions.\\n    *   **Prediction Target:** Instead of reconstructing raw pixels, RandSAC likely predicts high-level feature representations of the masked segments (e.g., the features from a pre-trained teacher network, or the ground-truth encoder features). This makes the task more abstract and semantic.\\n\\n**c. Loss Function:**\\n*   The primary loss would likely be a reconstruction loss (e.g., L1 or L2) between the predicted segment features and the actual features of the ground-truth masked segment. This loss would be applied iteratively for each predicted segment in the autoregressive sequence.\\n\\n**d. Efficiency:**\\n*   Similar to MAE, if RandSAC employs a high masking ratio for segments (i.e., a large portion of the image is masked out in segments), the encoder would operate only on a sparse set of visible segments, leading to computational efficiency during pre-training. The autoregressive decoding might add some complexity, but overall, it aims to be efficient compared to full image processing.\\n\\n**4. Novelty & Technical Contributions Summarized:**\\n\\n1.  **Segment-Level Self-Supervision:** A novel intermediate level of abstraction (between patch and global) for SSL, focusing on coherent spatial regions. This is a significant conceptual shift from existing paradigms.\\n2.  **Autoregressive Modeling for Vision SSL:** The most prominent technical contribution. Applying the principles of sequence generation (common in NLP) to learn visual representations by predicting conditional relationships between image segments. This is distinct from parallel reconstruction (MAE) or contrastive/distillation methods.\\n3.  **Implicit Inductive Bias for Structure:** By forcing sequential prediction, RandSAC inherently introduces an inductive bias towards understanding image composition, part-whole relationships, and spatial context, which could lead to representations that are more semantically grounded and robust.\\n4.  **Flexible Segment Definition:** The \"random segments\" concept implies a dynamic way of partitioning images, allowing for diverse learning signals and potentially capturing multi-scale information without explicit multi-scale architectures.\\n\\n**5. Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Richer Representations:** Potentially learns more semantically meaningful and structured representations due to the focus on segment relationships and conditional prediction.\\n*   **Stronger Inductive Bias:** The autoregressive nature provides a powerful inductive bias for sequential dependencies and compositionality, which are inherent in natural images.\\n*   **Generative Understanding:** Encourages the model to learn a deeper generative model of image data, rather than just discriminative features or simple reconstruction.\\n*   **Potential for Better Transfer:** Representations learned this way might transfer exceptionally well to tasks requiring fine-grained understanding, object detection, or segmentation, where understanding spatial relationships is critical.\\n\\n**6. Weaknesses/Limitations (and anticipated challenges):**\\n\\n*   **The \"Ordering Problem\" in 2D:** This is the most significant technical hurdle. How does RandSAC define the prediction order for image segments without imposing an artificial and potentially detrimental bias? The paper\\'s solution to this will be key to its success.\\n*   **Computational Complexity of Autoregressive Decoding:** While encoding might be efficient with high masking, autoregressive decoding can be computationally more intensive than parallel decoding, especially if it involves many steps.\\n*   **Sensitivity to Segment Definition:** The quality and diversity of the \"random segments\" will heavily influence the learned representations. Poor segment sampling could lead to suboptimal learning.\\n*   **Training Stability:** Autoregressive models can sometimes be trickier to train than parallel ones due to error propagation.\\n\\n**7. Potential Impact and Future Directions:**\\n\\nRandSAC has the potential to significantly impact the field of self-supervised learning for vision:\\n\\n*   **New SSL Paradigm:** It could establish a new paradigm for generative SSL that combines the efficiency of masking with the semantic richness of autoregressive modeling.\\n*   **Improved Vision Foundation Models:** If successful, it could yield significantly better pre-trained ViT models, leading to higher performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, especially those requiring detailed spatial understanding.\\n*   **Applications:** Particularly impactful for domains like robotics (understanding object manipulation), medical imaging (analyzing anatomical structures), or autonomous driving (perceiving complex scene layouts and object parts).\\n*   **Future Research:**\\n    *   Exploring more sophisticated, learned, or semantic-aware segment definitions.\\n    *   Investigating different autoregressive strategies for 2D data (e.g., non-causal dependencies, attention-based ordering).\\n    *   Combining RandSAC\\'s autoregressive objective with other SSL objectives (e.g., contrastive learning on segment embeddings).\\n    *   Extending to video by incorporating temporal segments.\\n\\n**8. Overall Assessment:**\\n\\nRandSAC represents a bold and highly novel step forward in self-supervised learning for vision. By introducing the concept of autoregressive prediction of random spatial segments, it directly tackles the challenge of learning intermediate-level spatial coherence and hierarchical structure in images, which is largely underexplored by current state-of-the-art methods. Its success will hinge on robust solutions to the \"ordering problem\" for 2D data and efficient segment definition. If these technical challenges are overcome effectively, RandSAC could indeed become a new benchmark, yielding richer and more semantically meaningful representations for Vision Transformers and pushing the boundaries of what\\'s possible with self-supervision.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.98861995}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'As an expert in research methodology and experimental design, I will evaluate the hypothetical paper \"Self-supervision through Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC)\".

The next segment in a sequence? Missing parts of a segment? Features of a segment based on previous ones?\\n        *   What is the autoregressive model (e.g., Transformer, LSTM, a specialized CNN)? How is its context window defined?\\n        *   What is the input and output representation for the autoregressive model (raw pixels, encoded features)?\\n        *   What is the specific loss function used for the autoregressive task (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy, perceptual loss)?\\n    *   **Integration:** How do the \"random segments\" and \"autoregressive coding\" interact? Is the autoregressive task applied *within* segments, *across* a sequence of segments, or both?

This should include:\\n        *   Contrastive methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo v3, BYOL, Barlow Twins).\\n        *   Masked Autoencoding methods (e.g., MAE, BEiT, SimMIM).\\n        *   Other relevant segment-based or sequence-based SSL methods if they exist.\\n    *   **Ablation Baselines:** This is crucial to isolate the contribution of each component of RandSAC.\\n        *   **\"Random Segments\" without Autoregression:** E.g., a simple contrastive loss applied to randomly sampled segments, or a reconstruction task on segments. This tests if the \"random segments\" alone are beneficial.\\n        *   **Autoregression without \"Random Segments\":** E.g., standard pixel-level or feature-level autoregressive prediction on full images/data, or fixed-grid segments.

Its success hinges on a meticulously designed methodology that clearly defines its novel components and an experimental setup that rigorously validates its performance. The paper must go beyond simply showing competitive numbers; it needs to dissect *why* RandSAC works, which specific design choices are critical, and how it truly advances the state of self-supervised representation learning. A strong set of baselines, thorough ablation studies, and diverse downstream evaluations will be paramount to convincing the community of its value.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.9878773}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Given the title \"Self-supervision through Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC),\" this research appears to explore a novel approach to self-supervised learning (SSL). Let\\'s break down its potential impact, broader implications, limitations, and future directions.\\n\\nThe core idea seems to be:\\n1.  **Self-supervision:** Learning representations from unlabeled data.\\n2.  **Random Segments:** Focusing on local or partial views of the input data (e.g., image patches, video clips, audio snippets, text spans). This is common in SSL (e.g., masked autoencoders, patch-based contrastive learning).\\n3.  **Autoregressive Coding:** Applying an autoregressive model (like those used in language modeling or generative image modeling) to learn representations *within* or *across* these segments. This suggests predicting future elements based on past ones, or generating/reconstructing segments in a sequential manner.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Potential Impact on the Field\\n\\n1.  **Novel Pretext Task Paradigm:** While masked prediction (MAE, BEiT) and contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo, DINO) dominate SSL, RandSAC introduces a distinct mechanism. By combining \"random segments\" (local focus, robustness to partial views) with \"autoregressive coding\" (sequential prediction, capturing dependencies), it might unlock a new way to learn rich, structured representations.\\n2.  **Enhanced Local Feature Learning:** Focusing on random segments forces the model to learn robust features from incomplete or diverse local contexts. Autoregressive coding within these segments could help the model understand the internal structure and dependencies of these local parts, leading to more granular and context-aware feature learning than methods that might only focus on global features or simple masking.\\n3.  **Potential for Stronger Transferability:** If RandSAC effectively learns both local patterns and their sequential relationships, the pre-trained models could exhibit superior performance when fine-tuned on downstream tasks that require fine-grained understanding or sequential reasoning (e.g., object detection with occlusions, action recognition in video, medical image analysis, dense prediction tasks).\\n4.  **Applicability Across Modalities:** The concept of \"segments\" and \"autoregressive coding\" is highly generalizable.\\n    *   **Vision:** Image patches, video frames/clips.\\n    *   **Audio:** Sound snippets, spectrogram segments.\\n    *   **Text:** Word/subword sequences (though established autoregressive models exist, applying the \"random segments\" concept in a novel way could be interesting).\\n    It could pave the way for more unified SSL frameworks across different data types.\\n5.  **Addressing Limitations of Current SSL:**\\n    *   **Contrastive Learning\\'s drawbacks:** Reduced need for negative pairs (which can be hard to manage for large datasets or complex features) or reliance on specific augmentation strategies.\\n    *   **Masked Modeling\\'s limitations:** While powerful, MAE/BEiT primarily learn through reconstruction. RandSAC\\'s autoregressive nature might capture different types of dependencies and predictive power.\\n\\n### Broader Implications\\n\\n1.  **Reduced Data Labeling Burden:** As with all effective SSL methods, RandSAC contributes to the paradigm of learning from vast amounts of unlabeled data, significantly reducing the reliance on costly and time-consuming manual data annotation. This democratizes AI development for resource-constrained domains or languages/modalities with limited labeled datasets.\\n2.  **More Robust AI Systems:** Learning from \"random segments\" inherently trains models to be more robust to partial information, occlusions, noise, and varying contexts. This is crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving, robotics, medical diagnostics (where images might be noisy or incomplete), and surveillance.\\n3.  **Foundation for Generative AI:** Autoregressive models are at the heart of many powerful generative models. If RandSAC effectively learns latent representations through autoregressive coding, it could serve as a strong pre-training step for subsequent generative tasks (e.g., generating missing segments, synthesizing new content).\\n4.  **Resource Efficiency (Potentially):** If RandSAC can achieve competitive performance with less computational cost (e.g., fewer large batches for contrastive learning, or less complex masking strategies), it could make high-quality representation learning more accessible. However, autoregressive models can also be computationally intensive.\\n5.  **New Research Avenues for Understanding Intelligence:** Understanding how models learn from sequential prediction within local contexts could provide insights into human perception and learning, which often relies on processing partial, sequential information to build a complete understanding.\\n\\n### Potential Limitations\\n\\n1.  **Computational Overhead:** Autoregressive models, especially for high-dimensional data like images or video, can be computationally expensive due to their sequential nature (dependencies between predictions) and the need to process many segments. Training time and memory footprint could be significant.\\n2.  **Complexity of Segment Definition:** How are \"random segments\" defined? Are they fixed-size patches, variable-length clips, or something else? The choice could significantly impact performance and might be highly sensitive to hyperparameters.\\n3.  **Lack of Global Context:** While learning from segments is good for local features, an over-reliance on purely local information might prevent the model from learning strong global structural relationships or long-range dependencies that are crucial for some tasks. The paper would need to show how it captures both.\\n4.  **Convergence and Stability:** Autoregressive training can be prone to issues like exposure bias (when generating sequences) or difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies effectively if not designed carefully.\\n5.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The number of segments, their size distribution, the specific autoregressive architecture, and the loss function details could introduce many hyperparameters that are challenging to tune.\\n6.  **Comparison to SOTA:** The method needs to demonstrate clear advantages over highly optimized and widely adopted SSL methods (e.g., MAE, DINO). It must justify its complexity or computational cost with a tangible performance gain or novel capability.\\n\\n### Avenues for Future Research\\n\\n1.  **Multi-Modal Integration:** Explore how RandSAC can be applied to learn joint representations across different modalities (e.g., video + audio, image + text), leveraging the segmented and sequential nature of data.\\n2.  **Adaptive Segment Selection:** Instead of purely random segments, investigate methods for adaptively selecting or weighting segments based on their information content, diversity, or semantic relevance. This could involve saliency maps or active learning principles.\\n3.  **Hybrid SSL Approaches:** Combine RandSAC with other SSL paradigms. For example, use RandSAC to learn strong local features, then apply a contrastive loss on global features derived from these local ones, or integrate it with masked prediction techniques.\\n4.  **Theoretical Understanding:** Deepen the theoretical understanding of *why* autoregressive coding on random segments leads to effective representations. What kinds of invariances or equivariances does it learn? How does it compare to other information-theoretic SSL objectives?\\n5.  **Efficiency and Scalability:** Develop more efficient autoregressive architectures or training strategies to reduce computational cost, enabling RandSAC to scale to even larger datasets and models. This could involve sparse attention, hierarchical autoregression, or distillation techniques.\\n6.  **Downstream Task Specialization:** Investigate specific fine-tuning strategies or architectural modifications that optimize RandSAC-pretrained models for particular downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, 3D reconstruction, reinforcement learning).\\n7.  **Beyond Reconstruction/Prediction:** Explore if the latent codes learned through autoregressive coding on segments can be directly used for other tasks, such as generating diverse new data samples, or for control policies in reinforcement learning.\\n8.  **Interpretability:** Examine whether the autoregressive process on segments leads to more interpretable or disentangled representations, allowing for a better understanding of what features the model has learned at a local level.\\n\\nIn conclusion, RandSAC presents a fascinating and potentially impactful direction in self-supervised learning. Its unique combination of random segments and autoregressive coding offers a fresh perspective on learning robust, structured representations from unlabeled data.

They stress the importance of ablation studies and diverse downstream tasks for evaluation.\n\nThe ImpactAssessor discusses the potential impact on reducing the data labeling burden, creating more robust AI systems, and providing a foundation for generative AI. They also mention potential limitations such as computational overhead and the complexity of segment definition.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe reviewers agree that RandSAC presents a novel approach to self-supervised learning with the potential for significant impact. The core idea of combining random segments with autoregressive coding is promising, but the success of the method hinges on addressing several challenges, including the ordering problem, computational complexity, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. The reviewers emphasize the need for a clear definition of the method, strong theoretical justification, and comprehensive experimental validation.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach with potential benefits, but also significant challenges that need to be addressed. A major revision is needed to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.\n\n**FINAL DECISION: Reject**\n", "elapsed_time": 108.78133082389832, "reviewer_agents": {"VisionExpert": {"base_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20", "description": "Expert in computer vision and self-supervised learning.", "system_prompt": "You are an expert in computer vision and self-supervised learning.
