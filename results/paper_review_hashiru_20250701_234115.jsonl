The paper title is: A Convergent Single-Loop Algorithm for Relaxation of Gromov-Wasserstein in Graph Data\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance provides a flexible way to compare and couple probability distributions supported on different metric spaces. As such, we have witnessed a fast-growing body of literature that applies the GW distance to various structural data analysis tasks, e.g., 2D/3D shape matching (Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2016; M\u00e9moli & Sapiro, 2004; M\u00e9moli, 2009), molecule analysis (Vayer et al., 2018; Titouan et al., 2019), graph alignment and partition (Chowdhury & M\u00e9moli, 2019; Xu et al., 2019b;a; Chowdhury & Needham, 2021; Gao et al., 2021), graph embedding and classification (Vincent-Cuaz et al., 2021b; Xu et al., 2022), generative modeling (Bunne et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021), to name a few. Although the GW distance has received much attention in both machine learning and data science communities, there are still few results that focus on the design of practically efficient algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. Existing algorithms either are double-loop (practically unstable) or do not have any theoretical justification. Recently, Solomon et al. (2016) has proposed an entropy-regularized iterative sinkhorn projection algorithm called eBPG, which is proven to converge under the Kurdyka-\u0141ojasiewicz framework (Attouch et al., 2010; 2013). However, eBPG has several crucial drawbacks that prevent its widespread adoption. First, instead of tackling the GW problem directly, eBPG addresses an entropic regularized GW objective, whose regularization parameter affects the model performance dramatically. Second, eBPG has to solve the entropic optimal transport problem (Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2019; Benamou et al., 2015) at each iteration via another iterative algorithm (Cuturi, 2013). Thus, eBPG is neither computationally efficient nor practically robust. To solve the GW problem directly, Xu et al. (2019b) proposes the Bregman projected gradient (BPG). Unfortunately, BPG is still a double-loop algorithm that also invokes the sinkhorn as its subroutine. Notably, due to the lack of the entropic regularizer, the inner solver suffered from the numerical instability issue. On another front, Titouan et al. (2019); M\u00e9moli (2011) have introduced the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method (see (Jaggi, 2013; Lacoste-Julien, 2016) for recent treatments) to solve the GW problem. Nevertheless, in their implementation, they still rely on off-the-shelf linear programming solvers and line-search schemes, which are not well-suited for even medium size tasks. To get rid of the computational burden and sensitivity issue arising from the double-loop scheme, it is only recently that Xu et al. (2019b) has further developed a simple heuristic single-loop method (BPG-S) based on BPG, which presented an attractive empirical performance on the node correspondence task. However, such a heuristic still lacks theoretical support, and thus it is not necessarily guaranteed to perform well (or even converge) under naturally noisy observations. To bridge the above theoretical-computational gap, we propose the first provable single-loop algorithm for the GW distance computation, which we call Bregman Alternating Projected Gradient (BAPG). The computational stumbling block here is the Birkhoff polytope constraint (i.e., polytope of doubly stochastic matrices) for the coupling matrix, as the associated Bregman projection is either computationally expensive or practically sensitive to hyperparameters. To address this issue, we are inspired to decouple the Birkhoff polytope as simplex constraints for rows and columns separately, and then execute the projected gradient descent in an alternating fashion. By leveraging the closed-form Bregman projection of the simplex constraint, BAPG only involves the matrixvector/matrix-matrix multiplications and element-wise matrix operations at each iteration. In short, the proposed single-loop algorithm (BAPG) enjoys a variety of convenient properties: GPU-friendly implementation, robustness concerning the step size (i.e., the only hyper-parameter), and low memory cost. Nonetheless, the iterates generated by BAPG do not necessarily satisfy the Birkhoff polytope constraint and can only reach a critical point of the original GW problem asymptotically. Fortunately, some learning tasks, e.g., graph alignment and partition, only care about the matching accuracy (i.e., performance measure) but not the sharpness of the matching coupling. Thus, we can sacrifice some feasibility to gain both matching accuracy and computational efficiency. For these practically relevant tasks, BAPG is already able to obtain the desirable performance and achieve a great balance between accuracy and efficiency. The comparison of various algorithms is summarized in Table 1. Next, we investigate the approximation bound and convergence behavior of the proposed BAPG. A key fact here is that the GW problem is a symmetric nonconvex quadratic program with polytope constraints. By fully exploring this problem-specific structure, it is surprisingly interesting to note that the GW problem satisfies the Luo-Tseng error bound condition (Luo & Tseng, 1992), which acts as a main technical tool to bound the distance between the fixed-point set of BAPG and the critical point set of the GW problem. This is a notable departure from the usual approach to utilizing the Luo-Tseng error bound condition in establishing the local linear convergence rate for structured convex problems (Zhou & So, 2017). As a result, we are able to quantify the approximation bound for the fixed-point set of BAPG explicitly and further establish the subsequent convergence result. Lastly, we provide extensive experiment results to validate the effectiveness of BAPG on graph alignment and graph partition. In terms of both wall-clock time and modeling performance (i.e., matching accuracy), we have shown that BAPG consistently achieves superior performance compared with other heuristic single-loop or theoretically sound double-loop methods. We also conduct the sensitivity analysis of BAPG and justify the effectiveness of its GPU acceleration on both synthetic and real-world datasets. All theoretical insights and results have been well-corroborated in the experiments. 2 PROPOSED ALGORITHM: In this section, we first formulate the GW distance as a nonconvex quadratic problem with Birkhoff polytope constraints. Subsequently, we provide the theoretical insights and computational properties of the proposed BAPG. 2.1 PROBLEM SETUP: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance was originally proposed in (M\u00e9moli, 2011; 2014; Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2019) for quantifying the distance between two probability measures supported on heterogeneous metric spaces. More precisely: Definition 2.1 (GW distance). Suppose that we are given two unregistered compact metric spaces (X ,dX), (Y,dY ) accompanied with Borel probability measures \u00b5,\u03bd respectively. The GW distance between \u00b5 and \u03bd is defined as inf \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) x \u2223dX(x,x\u2032) \u2212 dY (y, y\u2032)\u22232d\u03c0(x, y)d\u03c0(x\u2032, y\u2032), where \u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) is the set of all probability measures on X \u00d7Y with \u00b5 and \u03bd as marginals. Intuitively, the GW distance is trying to preserve the isometric structure between two probability measures under optimal derivation. If a map pairs x\u2192 y and x\u2032 \u2192 y\u2032, then the distance between x and x\u2032 is supposed to be close to the distance between y and y\u2032. In view of these nice properties, the GW distance acts as a powerful modeling tool in structural data analysis, especially in graph learning; see, e.g., (Vayer et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019b;a; Solomon et al., 2016; Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2016) and the references therein. To start with our algorithmic developments, we consider the discrete case for simplicity and practicality, where \u00b5 and \u03bd are two empirical distributions, i.e., \u00b5 = \u2211ni=1 \u00b5i\u03b4xi and \u03bd = \u2211mj=1 \u03bdj\u03b4yj . Then, the GW-distance admits the following reformulation: min \u03c0\u2208Rn\u00d7m \u2212Tr(DX\u03c0DY \u03c0T ) s.t. \u03c01m = \u00b5, \u03c0T 1n = \u03bd, \u03c0 \u2265 0, (1) where DX and DY are two symmetric distance matrices. 2.2 BREGMAN ALTERNATING PROJECTED GRADIENT (BAPG): Next, we present the proposed Bregman alternating projected gradient (BAPG) method, which is the first provable single-loop algorithm tailored to the GW distance computation. It is easy to observe that Problem (1) is a nonconvex quadratic program with polytope constraints. Naturally, if we want to invoke (Bregman) projected gradient descent type algorithms to address (1), the key difficulty lies in the Birkhoff constraint with respect to the coupling matrix \u03c0. In fact, all existing theoretically sound algorithms rely on an inner iterative algorithm to tackle the regularized optimal transport problem at each iteration, such as Sinkhorn (Cuturi, 2013) or semi-smooth Newton method (Li et al., 2020). Arguably, one of the main drawbacks of the double-loop scheme is the computational burden, and not GPU friendly. To circumvent this drawback, we are motivated to handle the row and columns constraints separately (i.e., C1 = {\u03c0 \u2265 0 \u2236 \u03c01m = \u00b5} and C2 = {\u03c0 \u2265 0 \u2236 \u03c0T 1n = \u03bd}). The crux of BPAG is to take the alternating projected gradient descent step between C1 and C2. Moreover, by fully detecting the hidden structures, we are able to further benefit from the fact that the Bregman projection with respect to the negative entropy for the simplex constraint (e.g., C1 and C2) can be extremely efficient computed (Krichene et al., 2015). The above considerations lead to the closed-form updates in each iteration of BAPG: BAPG \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0 \u2299 exp(DX\u03c0DY /\u03c1), \u03c0 \u2190 diag(\u00b5./\u03c01m)\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0 \u2299 exp(DX\u03c0DY /\u03c1), \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0diag(\u03bd./\u03c0T 1n), (2) where \u03c1 is the step size and \u2299 denotes element-wise (Hadamard) matrix multiplication. BAPG enjoys several nice properties that are extremely attractive for medium or large-scale graph learning tasks. First, BAPG is a single-loop algorithm that only involves matrix-vector/matrix-matrix multiplications and element-wise matrix operations. All these operations are GPU-friendly. Second, different from the entropic regularization parameter in eBPG, BAPG is more robust to the step size \u03c1 in terms of solution performance. Third, BAPG only involves one memory operation of a large matrix with size nm. Notably, even for large-scale optimal transport problems, the main bottleneck is not floating-point computations, but rather time-consuming memory operations (Mai et al., 2021). Theoretical Insights for BAPG Now, we start to give the theoretical intuition of why BAPG will work well in practice. For simplicity, we consider the compact form for illustration: min \u03c0 f(\u03c0) + g1(\u03c0) + g2(\u03c0). (3) Here, f(\u03c0) = \u2212Tr(DX\u03c0DY \u03c0T ) is a nonconvex quadratic function; g1(\u03c0) = I{\u03c0\u2208C1} and g2(\u03c0) = I{\u03c0\u2208C2} are two indicator functions over closed convex polyhedral sets. To better understand the alternating projected scheme developed in (2), we adopt the operator splitting strategy to reformulate (3) as min \u03c0=w f(\u03c0,w) + g1(\u03c0) + g2(w) (4) where f(\u03c0,w) = \u2212Tr(DX\u03c0DY wT ). Then, the BAPG update (2) can be interpreted as processing the alternating minimization scheme on the constructed penalized function, i.e., F\u03c1(\u03c0,w) = f(\u03c0,w) + g1(\u03c0) + g2(w) + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0,w). Here, Dh(\u22c5, \u22c5) is the so-called Bregman divergence, i.e., Dh(x, y) \u2236= h(x) \u2212 h(y) \u2212 \u27e8\u2207h(y),x \u2212 y\u27e9, where h(\u22c5) is the Legendre function, e.g., 1 2 \u2225x\u22252, relative entropy x logx, etc. For the k-th iteration, the BAPG update takes the form \u03c0k+1 = argmin \u03c0\u2208C1 {f(\u03c0,wk) + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0,wk)} , wk+1 = argmin w\u2208C2 {f(\u03c0k+1,w) + \u03c1Dh(w,\u03c0k+1)} . (5) When h is the relative entropy, (2) can be derived from (5). It is worth noting that the way to invoke the operator splitting strategy is not for the algorithm design as usual but instead to provide an intuitive way to explain why BAPG will work. As we shall see later, it plays an important role in deriving the approximation bound of the fix-point set of BAPG instead. Moreover, similar to the quadratic penalty method (Nocedal & Wright, 2006), BAPG is an infeasible method that can only converge to a critical point of (1) in an asymptotic sense. In other words, if we choose the parameter \u03c1 as a constant, there is always an infeasibility gap. Fortunately, BAPG is already able to achieve the desired performance for some graph learning tasks, especially those that care more about implementation efficiency and matching accuracy. Recently, (Vincent-Cuaz et al., 2021a) has proposed a relaxed version of GW distance for the graph partition task, which further corroborates our investigation that it is acceptable and promising to sacrifice some feasibility to gain other benefits. In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that BAPG has superior performance compared with other existing baselines on graph alignment and partition tasks. 3 THEORETICAL RESULTS: In this section, we present all theoretical results conducted in this paper, including the approximation bound of the fix-point set of BAPG and its convergence analysis. At the heart of our analysis is that the following regularity condition holds for the GW problem (1). Proposition 3.1 (Luo-Tseng Error Bound Condition for (1)). There exist scalars \u03f5 > 0 and \u03c4 > 0 such that dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 , (6) whenever \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 \u2264 \u03f5, where X is the critical point set of (3) defined by X = {\u03c0 \u2208 C1 \u2229C2 \u2236 0 \u2208 \u2207f(\u03c0) +NC1(\u03c0) +NC2(\u03c0)} (7) and NC(\u03c0) is the normal cone to C at \u03c0. As the GW problem is a nonconvex quadratic program with polytope constraint, we can invoke Theorem 2.3 in (Luo & Tseng, 1992) to conclude that the error bound condition (6) holds on the whole feasible set C1 \u2229C2. Proposition 3.1 extends (6) to the whole space Rn\u00d7m. This regularity condition is trying to bound the distance of any coupling matrix to the critical point set of the GW problem by its optimality residual, which is characterized by the difference for one step projected gradient descent. It turns out that this error bound condition plays an important role in quantifying the approximation bound for the fixed points set of BAPG explicitly. 3.1 APPROXIMATION BOUND FOR THE FIX-POINT SET OF BAPG: To start, we present one key lemma that shall be used in studying the approximation bound of BAPG. Lemma 3.2. Let C1 and C2 be convex polyhedral sets. There exists a constant M > 0 such that \u2225projC1(x) + projC2(y) \u2212 2projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )\u2225 \u2a7dM \u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y)\u2225 . The proof idea follows essentially from the observation that the inequality can be regarded as the stability of the optimal solution for a linear-quadratic problem, i.e., (p(r), q(r)) = argmin p,q 1 2 \u2225x \u2212 p\u22252 + 1 2 \u2225y \u2212 q\u22252 s.t. p \u2212 q = r, p \u2208 C1, q \u2208 C2. The parameter r is indeed the perturbation quantity. If r = 0, we have p(0) = q(0) = projC1\u2229C2( x+y 2 ); by choosing r = projC1(x)\u2212projC2(y), it is easy to see that (p(r), q(r)) = (projC1(x), projC2(y)). Together with Theorem 4.1 in (Zhang & Luo, 2022), the desired result is obtained. All the proof details are given in Appendix. Equipped with Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 3.1, it is not hard to obtain the following approximation result. Proposition 3.3 (Approximation Bound of the Fix-point Set of BAPG). The point (\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) belongs to the fixed-point set XBAPG of BAPG if it satisfies \u2207f(w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6)) + p = 0, \u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6)) + q = 0, (8) where p \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6) and q \u2208 NC2(w\u22c6). Then, the infeasibility error satisfies \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 \u03c41\u03c1 and the gap between XBAPG and X satisfies dist(\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ,X) \u2264 \u03c42 \u03c1 , where \u03c41 and \u03c42 are two constants. Remark 3.4. If \u03c0\u22c6 = w\u22c6, then XBAPG ((8)) is identical to X and BAPG can reach a critical point of the GW problem (1). Proposition 3.3 indicates that as \u03c1\u2192 +\u221e, the infeasibility error term \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 shrinks to zero and thus BAPG converges to a critical point of (1) in an asymptotic way. Furthermore, it explicitly quantifies the approximation gap when we select the parameter \u03c1 as a constant. The proof (i.e., explicit form of \u03c41 and \u03c42) can be found in Appendix. 3.2 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS OF BAPG: A further natural question is whether BAPG will converge or not. We answer the question in the affirmative. Specifically, we show that under several canonical assumptions, any limit point of BAPG belongs to XBAPG. Towards that end, let us first establish the sufficient decrease property of BAPG based on the potential function F\u03c1(\u22c5), Proposition 3.5. Let {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 be the sequence generated by BAPG. Suppose that Dh(\u22c5, \u22c5) is symmetric on the whole sequence. Then, we have F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212 F\u03c1(\u03c0k,wk) \u2264 \u2212\u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) \u2212 \u03c1Dh(wk,wk+1). (9) As F\u03c1(\u22c5) is coercive, we have\u2211\u221ek=0Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1)+Dh(wk,wk+1) < +\u221e. Both {Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1)}k\u22650 and {Dh(wk,wk+1)}k\u22650 converge to zero. Thus, the following convergence result holds. Theorem 3.6 (Subsequent Convergence of BAPG). Any limit point of the sequence {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 generated by BAPG belongs to XBAPG. Remark 3.7. The symmetric assumption in Proposition 3.4 does not hold for the KL divergence in general. However, if we add a mild condition that the asymmetric ratio is bounded for iterations, similar results can be achieved. Moreover, when h is a quadratic function, we can further obtain the global convergence result under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz analysis framework developed in (Attouch et al., 2010; 2013). To the best of our knowledge, the convergence analysis of alternating projected gradient descent methods has only been given under the convex setting, see (Wang & Bertsekas, 2016; Nedic\u0301, 2011) for details. In this paper, by heavily exploiting the error bound condition of the GW problem, we take the first step and provide a new path to conduct the analysis of alternating projected descent method for nonconvex problems, which could be of independent interest. 4 EXPERIMENT RESULTS: In this section, we provide extensive experiment results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed BAPG on various representative graph learning tasks, including graph alignment and graph partition. All simulations are implemented using Python 3.9 on a high-performance computing server running Ubuntu 20.04 with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. For all methods conducted in the experiment part, we use the relative error \u2225\u03c0k+1\u2212\u03c0k\u22252/\u2225\u03c0k\u22252 \u2264 1e\u22126 and the maximum iteration as the stopping criterion, i.e., min{k \u2208 Z \u2236 \u2225\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u22252/\u2225\u03c0k\u22252 \u2264 1e\u22126 andk \u2264 2000}. 4.1 TOY 2D MATCHING PROBLEM: In this subsection, we study a toy matching problem in 2D to corroborate our theoretical insights and results in Sec 2 and 3. Fig. 1 (a) shows an example of mapping a two-dimensional shape without any symmetries to a rotated version of the same shape. Here, we sample 300 and 400 points from source and target shapes respectively and use the Euclidean distance to construct the distance matrices DX and DY . Figs.1 (b)-(f) provide all color maps of coupling matrices to visualize the matching results. Here, the sparser coupling matrices indicate sharper mapping. All experiment results are consistent with Table 1. We can observe that both BPG and FW give us satisfactory solution performance as they aim at solving the GW problem exactly. However, FW and BPG will suffer from a huge computation burden which will be further justified in Sec 4.2 and 4.3. On the other hand, the performance of BPG-S and eBPG are obviously harmed by the infeasibility issue. The performance of BAPG on the accuracy of mapping falls between {FW, BPG} and {eBPG, BPG-S} but the computational cost is sometimes comparable with BPG-S and FW, even faster in later graph alignment and partition tasks due to its GPU-friendly property. As we shall see later, the infeasibility issue does not matter at all and will not result in even a real cost for graph alignment and partition tasks which only care about the matching accuracy instead of the sharpness of the coupling. 4.2 GRAPH ALIGNMENT: Graph alignment aims to identify the node correspondence between two graphs possibly with different topology structures (Zhang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020). Instead of solving the restricted quadratic assignment problem (Lawler, 1963; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006), the GW distance provides the optimal probabilistic correspondence relationship via preservation of the isometric property. Here, we compare the proposed BAPG with all existing baselines: FW (Titouan et al., 2019), BPG (Xu et al., 2019b), BPG-S (Xu et al., 2019b) (i.e., the only difference between BPG and BPG-S is that the number of inner iterations for BPG-S is just one), ScalaGW (Xu et al., 2019a), SpecGW (Chowdhury & Needham, 2021), and eBPG (Solomon et al., 2016). Except for BPG and eBPG, others are pure heuristic methods without any theoretical guarantee. Parameters Setup We utilize the unweighted symmetric adjacent matrices as our input distance matrices, i.e., DX and DY . Alternatively, SpecGW uses the heat kernel exp(\u2212L) where L is the normalized graph Laplacian matrix. We set both \u00b5 and \u03bd to be the uniform distribution. For three heuristic methods \u2014 BPG-S, ScalaGW, and SpecGW, we follow the same setup reported in their papers. As mentioned, eBPG is very sensitive to the entropic regularization parameter. To get comparable results, we report the best result among the set {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} of the regularization parameter. For BPG and BAPG, we use the constant step size 5 and \u03c1 = 0.1 respectively. For FW, we use the default implementation in the PythonOT package (see Appendix D). All the experiment results reported here were the average of 5 independent trials over different random seeds and the standard deviation is collected in Appendix. Database Statistics We test all methods on both synthetic and real-world databases. Our setup for the synthetic database is the same as in (Xu et al., 2019b). The source graph Gs = {Vs,Es} is generated by two ideal random models, Gaussian random partition and Barabasi-Albert models, with different scales, i.e., \u2223Vs\u2223 \u2208 {500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500}. Then, we generate the target graph Gt by adding more than q% nodes and edges on top of the source graph, where q \u2208 {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. For each setup, we generate five synthetic graph pairs over different random seeds. To sum up, the synthetic database contains 300 different graph pairs. We also validate our proposed methods on other three real-world databases from (Chowdhury & Needham, 2021), including two biological graph databases Proteins and Enzymes, and a social network database Reddit. Furthermore, to demonstrate the robustness of our method regarding the noise level, we follow the noise generating process (i.e., q = 10%) conducted for the synthesis case to create new databases on top of the three real-world databases. Towards that end, the statistics of all databases used for the graph alignment task have been summarized in Appendix D. We match each node in Gs with the most likely node in Gt according to the optimized \u03c0\u22c6. Given the predicted correspondence set Spred and the ground-truth correspondence set Sgt, we calculate the matching accuracy by Acc = \u2223Sgt \u2229 Spred\u2223/\u2223Sgt\u2223 \u00d7 100%. Results of Our Methods Table 2 shows the comparison of matching accuracy and wall-clock time on four databases. We observe that BAPG works exceptionally well both in terms of computational time and accuracy, especially for two large-scale noisy graph databases Synthetic and Reddit. Notably, BAPG is robust enough so that it is not necessary to perform parameter tuning. As we mentioned in Sec 2, the effectiveness of GPU acceleration for BAPG is also well corroborated on Synthetic and Reddit. GPU cannot further speed up the training time of Proteins and Reddit as graphs in these two databases are small-scale. Additional experiment results to demonstrate the robustness of BAPG and its GPU acceleration will be given in Sec 4.4. Comparison with Other Methods The performance of eBPG and ScalaGW are influenced by the entropic regularization parameter and approximation error respectively, which accounts for their poor performance. Moreover, it is easy to observe that SpecGW works pretty well on the small dataset but the performance degrades dramatically on the large one, e.g., synthetic. The reason is that SpecGW relies on a linear programming solver as its subroutine, which is not well-suited for large-scale settings. Besides, although ScalaGW has the lowest per-iteration computational complexity, the recursive K-partition mechanism developed in (Xu et al., 2019a) is not friendly to parallel computing. Therefore, ScalaGW does not demonstrate attractive performance on multi-core processors. 4.3 GRAPH PARTITION: The GW distance can also be potentially applied to the graph partition task. That is, we are trying to match the source graph with a disconnected target graph having K isolated and self-connected super nodes, where K is the number of clusters (Abrishami et al., 2020). Similarly, we compare the proposed BAPG with other baselines described in Section 4.2 on four real-world graph partitioning datasets. Parameters Setup For the input distance matrices DX and DY , we test our methods on both the adjacent matrices and the heat kernel matrices proposed in (Chowdhury & Needham, 2021). For BAPG, we pick up the lowest converged function value among \u03c1 \u2208 {0.1, 0.05, 0.01} for adjacent matrices and \u03c1 \u2208 {0.01, 0.005, 0.001} for heat kernel matrices. The quality of graph partition results is quantified by computing the adjusted mutual information (AMI) score (Vinh et al., 2010) against the ground-truth partition. Results of All Methods Table 3 shows the comparison of AMI scores among all methods on graph partition. BAPG outperforms other methods in most cases and is more robust to the noisy setting. Specifically, BAPG is consistently better than FW and SpecGW which both rely on the Frank-Wolfe method to solve the problem. eBPG has comparable results using the adjacency matrices but is unable to process the spectral matrices. The possible reason is that the adjacency matrix and the heat kernel matrix admit quite different structures, e.g., the former is sparse while the latter is dense. BPG and BPG-S enjoy similar performances in most cases, but both are not as good as our proposed BAPG on all datasets. Except for BPG and eBPG, others are pure heuristic methods without any theoretical guarantee. 4.4 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ROBUSTNESS OF BAPG: At first, we target at demonstrating the robustness of BAPG on graph alignment, as it would be more reasonable to test the robustness of a method on a database (e.g., graph alignment) rather than a single point (e.g., graph partition). Noise Level and Graph Scale At the beginning, we report the sensitivity analysis of BAPG regarding the noise level q% and the graph scale \u2223Vs\u2223 in Fig. 2 on the Synthetic Database. Surprisingly, the solution performance of BAPG is robust to both the noise level and graph scale. In contrast, the accuracy of other methods degrades dramatically as the noise level or the graph scale increases. Step Size \u03c1 Subsequently, we conduct the sensitivity analysis of BAPG with respect to the step size \u03c1 on four real-world databases. Table 4 showcases that the matching performance of BAPG is stable and robust regarding the step size. Moreover, convergence curves of different \u03c1 in Fig. 2 corroborate Proposition 3.3 empirically and further guide us on how to choose the step size. The larger \u03c1 means the smaller infeasibility error but slower convergence speed. Together with Table 4, we can conclude that if the resulting infeasibility error is not quite large (i.e., the step size \u03c1 is not so small), the final matching accuracy is robust to the step size. Under this situation, the step size only affects the convergence speed. GPU Acceleration of BAPG. We conduct experiment results to further justify that BAPG is GPU-friendly. In Table 5, We compare the acceleration ratio (i.e., CPU wall-clock time divided by GPU wall-clock time) of BAPG, eBPG, and BPG on two large-scale graph alignment datasets using the same computing server. For eBPG, we use the official implementation in the PythonOT package, which supports running on GPU. For BPG, we implement the GPU version by ourselves using Pytorch. We can find that BAPG has a much higher acceleration ratio on the GPU compared with BPG and eBPG. 5 CLOSING REMARK: In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on developing the provable single-loop algorithm (i.e., BAPG) for the GW distance computation. By exploiting the error bound condition (i.e., never investigated in the GW literature before), we are able to conduct the convergence analysis of BAPG. For a broader viewpoint, our work also takes the first step and provides a rather new path to study the alternating projected descent method for general nonconvex problems. To the best of our knowledge, it is still an open question even in the optimization community. On the computational side, the proposed single-loop algorithm BAPG still suffers from the cubic per-iteration computational complexity, which will further limit its applications in real-world large-scale settings. A natural future direction is to consider sparse and low-rank structures of the matching matrix to decrease the per-iteration cost and further speed up our method (Scetbon et al., 2021). A APPENDIX: Overall, the norm \u2225 \u22c5 \u2225 means \u21132 norm. Both dist and proj are defined w.r.t. \u21132 norm, i.e., for any convex set C and a point x, dist(x,C) =min y\u2208C \u2225x \u2212 y\u22252, (10) projC(x) = argmin y\u2208C \u2225x \u2212 y\u22252. (11) B PROBLEM PROPERTIES OF (1): In this paper, we consider the discrete case, where only m,n samples are drawn from real distributions, i.e., \u00b5 = \u2211ni=1 \u00b5i\u03b4xi and \u03bd = \u2211mj=1 \u03bdj\u03b4yj . The Gromov-Wasserstein distance between \u00b5 and \u03bd can be recast into the following minimization problem: min \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) x \u2223dX(x,x\u2032) \u2212 dY (y, y\u2032)\u22232d\u03c0(x, y)d\u03c0(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u21d2 min \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 \u2223dX(xi,xj) \u2212 dY (yk, yl)\u22232\u03c0ik\u03c0jl, where \u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) is a generalized Birkhoff polytope, i.e., \u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) = {\u03c0 \u2208 Rn\u00d7m+ \u2223\u03c01m = \u00b5,\u03c0T 1 = \u03bd}. To further simplify the problem and detect the hidden structures, we reformulate it as a compact form, n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 (DX(i, j) \u2212DY (k, l))2\u03c0ik\u03c0jl = n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 (D2X(i, j) +D2Y (k, l))\u03c0ik\u03c0jl \u2212 2 n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 DX(i, j)DY (k, l)\u03c0ik\u03c0jl = n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 D2X(i, j)\u00b5i\u00b5j + m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 D2Y (k, l)\u03bdk\u03bdl \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 constant \u22122Tr(DX\u03c0DY \u03c0T ). where DX(i, j) = dX(xi,xj) and DY (k, l) = dY (yk, yl) for i, j \u2208 [n] and k, l \u2208 [m]. Thus, (1) is obtained. Proof of Proposition 3.1 \u2014 Luo-Tseng Error Bound Condition for the GW Problem (1) Proof. Dx and DY are two symmetric matrices and C1 \u2229C2 is a convex polyhedral set. By invoking Theorem 2.3 in [24], the Luo-Tseng local error bound condition (6) just holds for the feasible set C1 \u2229C2. That is, dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 , (12) where \u03c0 \u2208 C1 \u2229C2. Then, we aim at extending (12) to the whole space. Define \u03c0\u0303 = projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0), we have dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 + d(\u03c0\u0303,X ) \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 + \u03c4\u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 (13) where the first inequality holds because of the triangle inequality, and the second one holds because of the fact \u03c0\u0303 \u2208 C1 \u2229C2 and (12). Apply the triangle inequality again, we have \u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 \u2264\u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 + \u2225projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 (14) Since \u03c0\u0303 = projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0), owing to the fact that the projection operator onto a convex set projC1\u2229C2(\u22c5) is non-expensive, i.e., \u2225projC1\u2229C2(x) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(y)\u2225 \u2264 \u2225x \u2212 y\u2225 holds for any x and y, we have \u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 = \u2225projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ))\u2225 \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225, (15) and \u2225projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 \u2264 \u2225(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ) \u2212 (\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 \u2264 (\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + 1)\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 (16) where \u03c3max(DX) and \u03c3max(DY ) denote the maximum singular value of DX and DY , respectively. By substituting (14) and (16) into (13), we get dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 (\u03c4\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + \u03c4 + 1)\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 + \u03c4\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 \u2264 (\u03c4\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + 2\u03c4 + 1)\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 (17) where the last inequality holds because of the fact that \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 = \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0)\u2225 = minx\u2208C1\u2229C2 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 x\u2225 \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225. By letting \u03c4 = \u03c4\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + 2\u03c4 + 1, we get the desired result. C CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS OF BAPG: Assumption C.1. The critical point set X is non-empty. Definition C.2 (Bregman Divergence). We define the proximity measure Dh \u2236 dom(h) \u00d7 int(dom(h))\u2192 R+ Dh(x, y) \u2236= h(x) \u2212 h(y) \u2212 \u27e8\u2207h(y),x \u2212 y\u27e9 The proximity measure Dh is the so-called Bregman Distance. It measures the proximity between x and y. Indeed, thanks to the gradient inequality, one has h is convex if and only if Dh(x, y) \u2265 0,\u2200x \u2208 domh, y \u2208 int domh. Concrete Examples \u2022 Relative entropy, or Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, h(x) = \u2211i xi logxi and the Bregman divergence is given as Dh(x, y) =\u2211 i xi log xi yi . \u2022 Quadratic function: h(x) = 1 2 \u2225x\u22252. As such, the Bregman divergence Dh(x, y) will reduce to the Euclidean distance. For the completeness of our algorithmic development, we also give the details how the general BAPG (5) update implies (2) if we choose the Legendre function as relative entropy. \u03c0k+1 = argmin \u03c0\u2208C1 {\u2212\u27e8\u03c0,DY wkDY \u27e9 + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0,wk)} = argmin \u03c0\u2208C1 Dh (\u03c0,wk \u2299 exp( DXw kDY \u03c1 )) , = diag(\u00b5./P k1m)P k, where P k = wk \u2299 exp (DXw kDY \u03c1 ). wk+1 = argmin w\u2208C2 {\u2212\u27e8w,DX\u03c0k+1DY \u27e9 + \u03c1Dh(w,\u03c0k+1)} = argmin w\u2208C2 Dh (w,\u03c0k+1 \u2299 exp( DX\u03c0 k+1DY \u03c1 )) , = Zkdiag(\u03bd./ZkT 1n), where Zk = \u03c0k+1 \u2299 exp (DX\u03c0 k+1DY \u03c1 ). The optimality conditions for each iteration follow, \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 0 \u2208 \u2212DXwkDY + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)) +NC1(\u03c0k+1), 0 \u2208 \u2212DX\u03c0k+1DY + \u03c1(\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1)) +NC2(wk+1). (18) Proof of Lemma 3.2 Proof. To prove \u2225projC1(x) + projC2(y) \u2212 2projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )\u2225 \u2a7dM \u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y)\u2225 , (19) we first convert the left-hand side of (19) to \u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 ) + projC2(y) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )\u2225 \u2264 \u221a 2\u2225(projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 ) , projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )) \u2212 (projC1(x), projC2(y))\u2225 . Then, the inequality can be regarded as the stability of the optimal solution for a linear-quadratic problem, i.e., (p(r), q(r)) = argmin p,q 1 2 \u2225x \u2212 p\u22252 + 1 2 \u2225y \u2212 q\u22252 s.t. p \u2212 q = r, p \u2208 C1, q \u2208 C2. (20) When r = 0, the pair (p(0), q(0)) satisfies p(0) = q(0) = projC1\u2229C2 ( x+y 2 ). Moreover, the parameter r itself can be viewed as the perturbation quantity, which is indeed the right-hand side of (19). By invoking Theorem 4.1 in (Zhang & Luo, 2022), we can bound the distance between two optimal solutions by the perturbation quantity r, i.e., \u2225(p(0), q(0)) \u2212 (p(r), q(r))\u2225 \u2264M\u2225r\u2225. Remark C.3. For any vector r, let (p(r), q(r)) be the optimal solution to (20). On the one hand, choosing r = 0, it is easy to see that p(0) = q(0) = projC1\u2229C2( x+y 2 ). On the other hand, by choosing r = projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y), it is easy to see that (p(r), q(r)) = (projC1(x), projC2(y)). Since Theorem 4.1 in (Zhang & Luo, 2022) implies that for any r, we have \u2225(p(0), q(0)) \u2212 (p(r), q(r))\u22252 \u2264M\u2225r\u22252 where M only depends on C1 and C2. By choosing r = projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y), we have \u2225(projC1\u2229C2( x + y 2 ), projC1\u2229C2( x + y 2 )) \u2212 (projC1(x), projC2(y)) \u2264M\u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y)\u22252. Proof of Proposition 3.3 \u2014 Approximation bound of fixed points of BAPG Definition C.4 (Bounded Linear Regularity (cf. Definition 5.6 in Bauschke (1996))). Let C1, . . . ,CN be closed convex subsets of Rn with a non-empty intersection C. We say that the collection {C1, . . . ,CN} is bounded linearly regular (BLR) if for every bounded subset B of Rn, there exists a constant \u03ba > 0 such that d(x,C) \u2264 \u03ba max i\u2208{1,...,N} d(x,Ci), for all x \u2208 B. If all of Ci are polyhedral sets, the BLR condition will automatically hold. Proof. Recall the fixed-point set of BAPG: XBAPG = {(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) \u2236 \u2207f(w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6)) + p = 0,p \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6)) + q = 0, q \u2208 NC2(w\u22c6) } . (21) Define \u03c0\u0302 = projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 \u22c6), we first want to argue the following inequality holds, \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)\u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225. As the BLR condition is satisfied for the polyhedral constraint, see Definition C.4 for details, we have \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 2\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 = 2dist(\u03c0\u22c6,C1 \u2229C2) + \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)\u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225. (22) Based on the stationary points defined in (8), we have, \u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6))T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + pT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) = 0,p \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6), \u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6))T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) + qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) = 0, q \u2208 NC2(w\u22c6). Summing up the above two equations, \u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6))T (w\u22c6 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + pT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) = 0 (\u2663) \u21d2\u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) \u2212 \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) +Dh(w\u22c6,\u03c0\u22c6)) + pT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) = 0 (\u2660) \u21d2\u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) \u2212 \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) +Dh(w\u22c6,\u03c0\u22c6)) \u2265 0, where (\u2663) holds as (\u2207h(x) \u2212 \u2207h(y))T (x \u2212 y) = Dh(x, y) +Dh(y,x) and (\u2660) follows from the property of the normal cone. For instance, since q \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6), we have qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) \u2264 0 (i.e., \u03c0\u0302 \u2208 C1). Therefore, \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) +Dh(w\u22c6,\u03c0\u22c6)) \u2264 \u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) \u2264 \u2225\u2207f(w\u22c6)\u2225\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)\u2225\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 Lf(\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225) (22) \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)Lf\u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225. The next to last inequality holds as f(\u22c5) is a quadratic function and the effective domain C1 \u2229 C2 is bounded. Thus, the norm of its gradient will naturally have a constant upper bound, i.e., Lf = \u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ). As h is a \u03c3-strongly convex, we have Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) \u2265 \u03c3 2 \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u22252. Together with this property, we can quantify the infeasibility error \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225, \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)Lf \u03b4\u03c1 . (23) When \u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e, it is easy to observe that the infeasibility error term \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 will shrink to zero. More importantly, if \u03c0\u22c6 = w\u22c6, then XBAPG will be identical to X . Next, we target at quantifying the approximation gap between the fixed-point set of BAPG and the critical point set of the original problem (1). Upon (21), we have \u2207f (\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ) + p + q 2 = 0, where \u2207f(\u22c5) is a linear operator. By applying the Luo-Tseng local error bound condition of (1), i.e., Proposition 3.1, we have dist(\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ,X) \u2264 \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( \u03c0\u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 \u2212\u2207f (\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ))\u2225 = \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( \u03c0\u22c6 + p +w\u22c6 + q 2 )\u2225 (\u2663)= \u03c4 2 \u2225projC1(\u03c0 \u22c6 + p) + projC1(w \u22c6 + q) \u2212 2projC1\u2229C2 ( \u03c0\u22c6 + p +w\u22c6 + q 2 )\u2225 (\u2660) \u2264 M\u03c4 2 \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225, where (\u2663) holds due to the normal cone property, that is, projC(x + z) = x for any x \u2208 C and z \u2208 NC(x), and (\u2660) follows from Lemma 3.2. Incorporating with (23), the approximation bound for BAPG has been characterized quantitatively, i.e., dist(\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ,X) \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)LfM 2\u03b4\u03c1 . Proof of Proposition 3.5 \u2014 Sufficient decrease property of BAPG Proof. We first observe from the optimality conditions of main updates, i.e., 0 \u2208 \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)) + \u2202g1(\u03c0k+1) (24) 0 \u2208 \u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk) + \u03c1(\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1)) + \u2202g2(wk+1) (25) where g1(\u03c0) = I{\u03c0\u2208C1} and g2(w) = I{w\u2208C2}. Due to the convexity of g1(\u22c5), it is natural to obtain, g1(\u03c0k) \u2212 g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2265 \u2212\u27e8\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)),\u03c0k \u2212 \u03c0k+1\u27e9 = \u2212\u27e8\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk),\u03c0k \u2212 \u03c0k+1\u27e9 + \u27e8\u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9 As f(\u03c0,w) = \u2212tr(DX\u03c0DY wT ) is a bilinear function, we have, f(\u03c0k,wk) \u2212 f(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212 \u27e8\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk),\u03c0k \u2212 \u03c0k+1\u27e9 = 0. Consequently, we get f(\u03c0k,wk) + g1(\u03c0k) \u2212 f(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212 g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2265 \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9. (26) Similarly, based on the w-update, we obtain f(\u03c0k+1,wk)+g2(wk)\u2212f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)\u2212g2(wk+1) \u2265 \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(wk+1)\u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1),wk+1 \u2212wk\u27e9. (27) Combine with (26) and (27), we obtain f(\u03c0k,wk) + g1(\u03c0k) + g2(wk) \u2212 f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212 g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2212 g2(wk+1) \u2265 \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9 + \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1),wk+1 \u2212wk\u27e9. (28) The right-hand side can be further simplified, \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9 + \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1),wk+1 \u2212wk\u27e9 (\u2663)= \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) +Dh(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212Dh(\u03c0k,wk)) + \u03c1(Dh(wk,wk+1)+ Dh(wk+1,\u03c0k+1) \u2212Dh(wk,\u03c0k+1)) (\u2660)= \u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) + \u03c1Dh(wk,wk+1) \u2212 \u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,wk) + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0k+1,wk+1). Here, (\u2663) uses the fact that the three-point property of Bregman divergence holds, i.e., For any y, z \u2208 int domh and x \u2208 domh, Dh(x, z) \u2212Dh(x, y) \u2212Dh(y, z) = \u27e8\u2207h(y) \u2212\u2207h(z),x \u2212 y\u27e9. Moreover, (\u2660) holds as Dh(\u22c5, \u22c5) is symmetric on the whole sequence. To proceed, this together with (28) implies F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212 F\u03c1(\u03c0k,wk) \u2264 \u2212\u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) \u2212 \u03c1Dh(wk,wk+1). (29) Summing up (29) from k = 0 to +\u221e, we obtain F\u03c1(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) \u2212 F\u03c1(\u03c00,w0) \u2264 \u2212\u03ba1 \u221e \u2211 k=0 (Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) +Dh(wk,wk+1)) . As the potential function F\u03c1(\u22c5, \u22c5) is coercive and {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 is a bounded sequence, it means the left-hand side is bounded, which implies \u221e \u2211 k=0 (Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) +Dh(wk,wk+1)) < +\u221e. Proof of Theorem 3.6 \u2014 Subsequence convergence result of BAPG Proof. Let (\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) be a limit point of the sequence {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650. Then, there exists a sequence {nk}k\u22650 such that {(\u03c0nk ,wnk)}k\u22650 converges to (\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e). Replacing k by nk in (24) and (25), taking limits on both sides as k \u2192\u221e 0 \u2208 \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u221e) \u2212\u2207h(w\u221e)) + \u2202g1(\u03c0\u221e) 0 \u2208 \u2207wf(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u221e) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u221e)) + \u2202g2(w\u221e). Based on the fact that \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) = \u2207f(w\u221e) and \u2207wf(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) = \u2207f(\u03c0\u221e), it can be easily concluded that (\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) \u2208 XBAPG. More importantly, the above subsequence convergence result can be extended to the global convergence if the Legendre function h(\u22c5) is quadratic. Theorem C.5 (Global Convergence of BAPG \u2014 Quadratic Case). The sequence {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 converges to a critical point of F\u03c1(\u03c0,w). Proof. To invoke the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz analysis framework developed in (Attouch et al., 2010; 2013), we have to establish two crucial properties \u2014 sufficient decrease and safeguard condition. The first one has already been proven in Proposition 3.5. Then, we would like to show that there exists a constant \u03ba2 such that, dist(0,\u2202F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)) \u2264 \u03ba2(\u2225\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u2225 + \u2225wk+1 \u2212wk\u2225). At first, noting that \u2202F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) = \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) + \u03c1(\u03c0k+1 \u2212wk+1) + \u2202g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) + \u03c1(wk+1 \u2212 \u03c0k+1) + \u2202g2(wk+1) \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 . Again, together with the updates (24) and (25), this implies dist2(0,\u2202F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)) \u2264 \u2225\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk)\u22252 + \u03c1\u2225wk \u2212wk+1\u22252 + \u2225\u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212\u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)\u22252 \u2264 (\u03c32max(DX)\u03c32max(DY ) + \u03c1)\u2225wk \u2212wk+1\u22252, where \u03c3max(\u22c5) denotes the maximum singular value. By letting \u03ba2 = \u221a \u03c32max(DX)\u03c32max(DY ) + \u03c1, we get the desired result.

The paper title is: A Convergent Single-Loop Algorithm for Relaxation of Gromov-Wasserstein in Graph Data\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance provides a flexible way to compare and couple probability distributions supported on different metric spaces. As such, we have witnessed a fast-growing body of literature that applies the GW distance to various structural data analysis tasks, e.g., 2D/3D shape matching (Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2016; M\u00e9moli & Sapiro, 2004; M\u00e9moli, 2009), molecule analysis (Vayer et al., 2018; Titouan et al., 2019), graph alignment and partition (Chowdhury & M\u00e9moli, 2019; Xu et al., 2019b;a; Chowdhury & Needham, 2021; Gao et al., 2021), graph embedding and classification (Vincent-Cuaz et al., 2021b; Xu et al., 2022), generative modeling (Bunne et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021), to name a few. Although the GW distance has received much attention in both machine learning and data science communities, there are still few results that focus on the design of practically efficient algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. Existing algorithms either are double-loop (practically unstable) or do not have any theoretical justification. Recently, Solomon et al. (2016) has proposed an entropy-regularized iterative sinkhorn projection algorithm called eBPG, which is proven to converge under the Kurdyka-\u0141ojasiewicz framework (Attouch et al., 2010; 2013). However, eBPG has several crucial drawbacks that prevent its widespread adoption. First, instead of tackling the GW problem directly, eBPG addresses an entropic regularized GW objective, whose regularization parameter affects the model performance dramatically. Second, eBPG has to solve the entropic optimal transport problem (Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2019; Benamou et al., 2015) at each iteration via another iterative algorithm (Cuturi, 2013). Thus, eBPG is neither computationally efficient nor practically robust. To solve the GW problem directly, Xu et al. (2019b) proposes the Bregman projected gradient (BPG). Unfortunately, BPG is still a double-loop algorithm that also invokes the sinkhorn as its subroutine. Notably, due to the lack of the entropic regularizer, the inner solver suffered from the numerical instability issue. On another front, Titouan et al. (2019); M\u00e9moli (2011) have introduced the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method (see (Jaggi, 2013; Lacoste-Julien, 2016) for recent treatments) to solve the GW problem. Nevertheless, in their implementation, they still rely on off-the-shelf linear programming solvers and line-search schemes, which are not well-suited for even medium size tasks. To get rid of the computational burden and sensitivity issue arising from the double-loop scheme, it is only recently that Xu et al. (2019b) has further developed a simple heuristic single-loop method (BPG-S) based on BPG, which presented an attractive empirical performance on the node correspondence task. However, such a heuristic still lacks theoretical support, and thus it is not necessarily guaranteed to perform well (or even converge) under naturally noisy observations. To bridge the above theoretical-computational gap, we propose the first provable single-loop algorithm for the GW distance computation, which we call Bregman Alternating Projected Gradient (BAPG). The computational stumbling block here is the Birkhoff polytope constraint (i.e., polytope of doubly stochastic matrices) for the coupling matrix, as the associated Bregman projection is either computationally expensive or practically sensitive to hyperparameters. To address this issue, we are inspired to decouple the Birkhoff polytope as simplex constraints for rows and columns separately, and then execute the projected gradient descent in an alternating fashion. By leveraging the closed-form Bregman projection of the simplex constraint, BAPG only involves the matrixvector/matrix-matrix multiplications and element-wise matrix operations at each iteration. In short, the proposed single-loop algorithm (BAPG) enjoys a variety of convenient properties: GPU-friendly implementation, robustness concerning the step size (i.e., the only hyper-parameter), and low memory cost. Nonetheless, the iterates generated by BAPG do not necessarily satisfy the Birkhoff polytope constraint and can only reach a critical point of the original GW problem asymptotically. Fortunately, some learning tasks, e.g., graph alignment and partition, only care about the matching accuracy (i.e., performance measure) but not the sharpness of the matching coupling. Thus, we can sacrifice some feasibility to gain both matching accuracy and computational efficiency. For these practically relevant tasks, BAPG is already able to obtain the desirable performance and achieve a great balance between accuracy and efficiency. The comparison of various algorithms is summarized in Table 1. Next, we investigate the approximation bound and convergence behavior of the proposed BAPG. A key fact here is that the GW problem is a symmetric nonconvex quadratic program with polytope constraints. By fully exploring this problem-specific structure, it is surprisingly interesting to note that the GW problem satisfies the Luo-Tseng error bound condition (Luo & Tseng, 1992), which acts as a main technical tool to bound the distance between the fixed-point set of BAPG and the critical point set of the GW problem. This is a notable departure from the usual approach to utilizing the Luo-Tseng error bound condition in establishing the local linear convergence rate for structured convex problems (Zhou & So, 2017). As a result, we are able to quantify the approximation bound for the fixed-point set of BAPG explicitly and further establish the subsequent convergence result. Lastly, we provide extensive experiment results to validate the effectiveness of BAPG on graph alignment and graph partition. In terms of both wall-clock time and modeling performance (i.e., matching accuracy), we have shown that BAPG consistently achieves superior performance compared with other heuristic single-loop or theoretically sound double-loop methods. We also conduct the sensitivity analysis of BAPG and justify the effectiveness of its GPU acceleration on both synthetic and real-world datasets. All theoretical insights and results have been well-corroborated in the experiments. 2 PROPOSED ALGORITHM: In this section, we first formulate the GW distance as a nonconvex quadratic problem with Birkhoff polytope constraints. Subsequently, we provide the theoretical insights and computational properties of the proposed BAPG. 2.1 PROBLEM SETUP: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance was originally proposed in (M\u00e9moli, 2011; 2014; Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2019) for quantifying the distance between two probability measures supported on heterogeneous metric spaces. More precisely: Definition 2.1 (GW distance). Suppose that we are given two unregistered compact metric spaces (X ,dX), (Y,dY ) accompanied with Borel probability measures \u00b5,\u03bd respectively. The GW distance between \u00b5 and \u03bd is defined as inf \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) x \u2223dX(x,x\u2032) \u2212 dY (y, y\u2032)\u22232d\u03c0(x, y)d\u03c0(x\u2032, y\u2032), where \u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) is the set of all probability measures on X \u00d7Y with \u00b5 and \u03bd as marginals. Intuitively, the GW distance is trying to preserve the isometric structure between two probability measures under optimal derivation. If a map pairs x\u2192 y and x\u2032 \u2192 y\u2032, then the distance between x and x\u2032 is supposed to be close to the distance between y and y\u2032. In view of these nice properties, the GW distance acts as a powerful modeling tool in structural data analysis, especially in graph learning; see, e.g., (Vayer et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019b;a; Solomon et al., 2016; Peyr\u00e9 et al., 2016) and the references therein. To start with our algorithmic developments, we consider the discrete case for simplicity and practicality, where \u00b5 and \u03bd are two empirical distributions, i.e., \u00b5 = \u2211ni=1 \u00b5i\u03b4xi and \u03bd = \u2211mj=1 \u03bdj\u03b4yj . Then, the GW-distance admits the following reformulation: min \u03c0\u2208Rn\u00d7m \u2212Tr(DX\u03c0DY \u03c0T ) s.t. \u03c01m = \u00b5, \u03c0T 1n = \u03bd, \u03c0 \u2265 0, (1) where DX and DY are two symmetric distance matrices. 2.2 BREGMAN ALTERNATING PROJECTED GRADIENT (BAPG): Next, we present the proposed Bregman alternating projected gradient (BAPG) method, which is the first provable single-loop algorithm tailored to the GW distance computation. It is easy to observe that Problem (1) is a nonconvex quadratic program with polytope constraints. Naturally, if we want to invoke (Bregman) projected gradient descent type algorithms to address (1), the key difficulty lies in the Birkhoff constraint with respect to the coupling matrix \u03c0. In fact, all existing theoretically sound algorithms rely on an inner iterative algorithm to tackle the regularized optimal transport problem at each iteration, such as Sinkhorn (Cuturi, 2013) or semi-smooth Newton method (Li et al., 2020). Arguably, one of the main drawbacks of the double-loop scheme is the computational burden, and not GPU friendly. To circumvent this drawback, we are motivated to handle the row and columns constraints separately (i.e., C1 = {\u03c0 \u2265 0 \u2236 \u03c01m = \u00b5} and C2 = {\u03c0 \u2265 0 \u2236 \u03c0T 1n = \u03bd}). The crux of BPAG is to take the alternating projected gradient descent step between C1 and C2. Moreover, by fully detecting the hidden structures, we are able to further benefit from the fact that the Bregman projection with respect to the negative entropy for the simplex constraint (e.g., C1 and C2) can be extremely efficient computed (Krichene et al., 2015). The above considerations lead to the closed-form updates in each iteration of BAPG: BAPG \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0 \u2299 exp(DX\u03c0DY /\u03c1), \u03c0 \u2190 diag(\u00b5./\u03c01m)\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0 \u2299 exp(DX\u03c0DY /\u03c1), \u03c0 \u2190 \u03c0diag(\u03bd./\u03c0T 1n), (2) where \u03c1 is the step size and \u2299 denotes element-wise (Hadamard) matrix multiplication. BAPG enjoys several nice properties that are extremely attractive for medium or large-scale graph learning tasks. First, BAPG is a single-loop algorithm that only involves matrix-vector/matrix-matrix multiplications and element-wise matrix operations. All these operations are GPU-friendly. Second, different from the entropic regularization parameter in eBPG, BAPG is more robust to the step size \u03c1 in terms of solution performance. Third, BAPG only involves one memory operation of a large matrix with size nm. Notably, even for large-scale optimal transport problems, the main bottleneck is not floating-point computations, but rather time-consuming memory operations (Mai et al., 2021). Theoretical Insights for BAPG Now, we start to give the theoretical intuition of why BAPG will work well in practice. For simplicity, we consider the compact form for illustration: min \u03c0 f(\u03c0) + g1(\u03c0) + g2(\u03c0). (3) Here, f(\u03c0) = \u2212Tr(DX\u03c0DY \u03c0T ) is a nonconvex quadratic function; g1(\u03c0) = I{\u03c0\u2208C1} and g2(\u03c0) = I{\u03c0\u2208C2} are two indicator functions over closed convex polyhedral sets. To better understand the alternating projected scheme developed in (2), we adopt the operator splitting strategy to reformulate (3) as min \u03c0=w f(\u03c0,w) + g1(\u03c0) + g2(w) (4) where f(\u03c0,w) = \u2212Tr(DX\u03c0DY wT ). Then, the BAPG update (2) can be interpreted as processing the alternating minimization scheme on the constructed penalized function, i.e., F\u03c1(\u03c0,w) = f(\u03c0,w) + g1(\u03c0) + g2(w) + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0,w). Here, Dh(\u22c5, \u22c5) is the so-called Bregman divergence, i.e., Dh(x, y) \u2236= h(x) \u2212 h(y) \u2212 \u27e8\u2207h(y),x \u2212 y\u27e9, where h(\u22c5) is the Legendre function, e.g., 1 2 \u2225x\u22252, relative entropy x logx, etc. For the k-th iteration, the BAPG update takes the form \u03c0k+1 = argmin \u03c0\u2208C1 {f(\u03c0,wk) + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0,wk)} , wk+1 = argmin w\u2208C2 {f(\u03c0k+1,w) + \u03c1Dh(w,\u03c0k+1)} . (5) When h is the relative entropy, (2) can be derived from (5). It is worth noting that the way to invoke the operator splitting strategy is not for the algorithm design as usual but instead to provide an intuitive way to explain why BAPG will work. As we shall see later, it plays an important role in deriving the approximation bound of the fix-point set of BAPG instead. Moreover, similar to the quadratic penalty method (Nocedal & Wright, 2006), BAPG is an infeasible method that can only converge to a critical point of (1) in an asymptotic sense. In other words, if we choose the parameter \u03c1 as a constant, there is always an infeasibility gap. Fortunately, BAPG is already able to achieve the desired performance for some graph learning tasks, especially those that care more about implementation efficiency and matching accuracy. Recently, (Vincent-Cuaz et al., 2021a) has proposed a relaxed version of GW distance for the graph partition task, which further corroborates our investigation that it is acceptable and promising to sacrifice some feasibility to gain other benefits. In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that BAPG has superior performance compared with other existing baselines on graph alignment and partition tasks. 3 THEORETICAL RESULTS: In this section, we present all theoretical results conducted in this paper, including the approximation bound of the fix-point set of BAPG and its convergence analysis. At the heart of our analysis is that the following regularity condition holds for the GW problem (1). Proposition 3.1 (Luo-Tseng Error Bound Condition for (1)). There exist scalars \u03f5 > 0 and \u03c4 > 0 such that dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 , (6) whenever \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 \u2264 \u03f5, where X is the critical point set of (3) defined by X = {\u03c0 \u2208 C1 \u2229C2 \u2236 0 \u2208 \u2207f(\u03c0) +NC1(\u03c0) +NC2(\u03c0)} (7) and NC(\u03c0) is the normal cone to C at \u03c0. As the GW problem is a nonconvex quadratic program with polytope constraint, we can invoke Theorem 2.3 in (Luo & Tseng, 1992) to conclude that the error bound condition (6) holds on the whole feasible set C1 \u2229C2. Proposition 3.1 extends (6) to the whole space Rn\u00d7m. This regularity condition is trying to bound the distance of any coupling matrix to the critical point set of the GW problem by its optimality residual, which is characterized by the difference for one step projected gradient descent. It turns out that this error bound condition plays an important role in quantifying the approximation bound for the fixed points set of BAPG explicitly. 3.1 APPROXIMATION BOUND FOR THE FIX-POINT SET OF BAPG: To start, we present one key lemma that shall be used in studying the approximation bound of BAPG. Lemma 3.2. Let C1 and C2 be convex polyhedral sets. There exists a constant M > 0 such that \u2225projC1(x) + projC2(y) \u2212 2projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )\u2225 \u2a7dM \u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y)\u2225 . The proof idea follows essentially from the observation that the inequality can be regarded as the stability of the optimal solution for a linear-quadratic problem, i.e., (p(r), q(r)) = argmin p,q 1 2 \u2225x \u2212 p\u22252 + 1 2 \u2225y \u2212 q\u22252 s.t. p \u2212 q = r, p \u2208 C1, q \u2208 C2. The parameter r is indeed the perturbation quantity. If r = 0, we have p(0) = q(0) = projC1\u2229C2( x+y 2 ); by choosing r = projC1(x)\u2212projC2(y), it is easy to see that (p(r), q(r)) = (projC1(x), projC2(y)). Together with Theorem 4.1 in (Zhang & Luo, 2022), the desired result is obtained. All the proof details are given in Appendix. Equipped with Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 3.1, it is not hard to obtain the following approximation result. Proposition 3.3 (Approximation Bound of the Fix-point Set of BAPG). The point (\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) belongs to the fixed-point set XBAPG of BAPG if it satisfies \u2207f(w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6)) + p = 0, \u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6)) + q = 0, (8) where p \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6) and q \u2208 NC2(w\u22c6). Then, the infeasibility error satisfies \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 \u03c41\u03c1 and the gap between XBAPG and X satisfies dist(\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ,X) \u2264 \u03c42 \u03c1 , where \u03c41 and \u03c42 are two constants. Remark 3.4. If \u03c0\u22c6 = w\u22c6, then XBAPG ((8)) is identical to X and BAPG can reach a critical point of the GW problem (1). Proposition 3.3 indicates that as \u03c1\u2192 +\u221e, the infeasibility error term \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 shrinks to zero and thus BAPG converges to a critical point of (1) in an asymptotic way. Furthermore, it explicitly quantifies the approximation gap when we select the parameter \u03c1 as a constant. The proof (i.e., explicit form of \u03c41 and \u03c42) can be found in Appendix. 3.2 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS OF BAPG: A further natural question is whether BAPG will converge or not. We answer the question in the affirmative. Specifically, we show that under several canonical assumptions, any limit point of BAPG belongs to XBAPG. Towards that end, let us first establish the sufficient decrease property of BAPG based on the potential function F\u03c1(\u22c5), Proposition 3.5. Let {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 be the sequence generated by BAPG. Suppose that Dh(\u22c5, \u22c5) is symmetric on the whole sequence. Then, we have F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212 F\u03c1(\u03c0k,wk) \u2264 \u2212\u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) \u2212 \u03c1Dh(wk,wk+1). (9) As F\u03c1(\u22c5) is coercive, we have\u2211\u221ek=0Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1)+Dh(wk,wk+1) < +\u221e. Both {Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1)}k\u22650 and {Dh(wk,wk+1)}k\u22650 converge to zero. Thus, the following convergence result holds. Theorem 3.6 (Subsequent Convergence of BAPG). Any limit point of the sequence {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 generated by BAPG belongs to XBAPG. Remark 3.7. The symmetric assumption in Proposition 3.4 does not hold for the KL divergence in general. However, if we add a mild condition that the asymmetric ratio is bounded for iterations, similar results can be achieved. Moreover, when h is a quadratic function, we can further obtain the global convergence result under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz analysis framework developed in (Attouch et al., 2010; 2013). To the best of our knowledge, the convergence analysis of alternating projected gradient descent methods has only been given under the convex setting, see (Wang & Bertsekas, 2016; Nedic\u0301, 2011) for details. In this paper, by heavily exploiting the error bound condition of the GW problem, we take the first step and provide a new path to conduct the analysis of alternating projected descent method for nonconvex problems, which could be of independent interest. 4 EXPERIMENT RESULTS: In this section, we provide extensive experiment results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed BAPG on various representative graph learning tasks, including graph alignment and graph partition. All simulations are implemented using Python 3.9 on a high-performance computing server running Ubuntu 20.04 with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. For all methods conducted in the experiment part, we use the relative error \u2225\u03c0k+1\u2212\u03c0k\u22252/\u2225\u03c0k\u22252 \u2264 1e\u22126 and the maximum iteration as the stopping criterion, i.e., min{k \u2208 Z \u2236 \u2225\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u22252/\u2225\u03c0k\u22252 \u2264 1e\u22126 andk \u2264 2000}. 4.1 TOY 2D MATCHING PROBLEM: In this subsection, we study a toy matching problem in 2D to corroborate our theoretical insights and results in Sec 2 and 3. Fig. 1 (a) shows an example of mapping a two-dimensional shape without any symmetries to a rotated version of the same shape. Here, we sample 300 and 400 points from source and target shapes respectively and use the Euclidean distance to construct the distance matrices DX and DY . Figs.1 (b)-(f) provide all color maps of coupling matrices to visualize the matching results. Here, the sparser coupling matrices indicate sharper mapping. All experiment results are consistent with Table 1. We can observe that both BPG and FW give us satisfactory solution performance as they aim at solving the GW problem exactly. However, FW and BPG will suffer from a huge computation burden which will be further justified in Sec 4.2 and 4.3. On the other hand, the performance of BPG-S and eBPG are obviously harmed by the infeasibility issue. The performance of BAPG on the accuracy of mapping falls between {FW, BPG} and {eBPG, BPG-S} but the computational cost is sometimes comparable with BPG-S and FW, even faster in later graph alignment and partition tasks due to its GPU-friendly property. As we shall see later, the infeasibility issue does not matter at all and will not result in even a real cost for graph alignment and partition tasks which only care about the matching accuracy instead of the sharpness of the coupling. 4.2 GRAPH ALIGNMENT: Graph alignment aims to identify the node correspondence between two graphs possibly with different topology structures (Zhang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020). Instead of solving the restricted quadratic assignment problem (Lawler, 1963; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006), the GW distance provides the optimal probabilistic correspondence relationship via preservation of the isometric property. Here, we compare the proposed BAPG with all existing baselines: FW (Titouan et al., 2019), BPG (Xu et al., 2019b), BPG-S (Xu et al., 2019b) (i.e., the only difference between BPG and BPG-S is that the number of inner iterations for BPG-S is just one), ScalaGW (Xu et al., 2019a), SpecGW (Chowdhury & Needham, 2021), and eBPG (Solomon et al., 2016). Except for BPG and eBPG, others are pure heuristic methods without any theoretical guarantee. Parameters Setup We utilize the unweighted symmetric adjacent matrices as our input distance matrices, i.e., DX and DY . Alternatively, SpecGW uses the heat kernel exp(\u2212L) where L is the normalized graph Laplacian matrix. We set both \u00b5 and \u03bd to be the uniform distribution. For three heuristic methods \u2014 BPG-S, ScalaGW, and SpecGW, we follow the same setup reported in their papers. As mentioned, eBPG is very sensitive to the entropic regularization parameter. To get comparable results, we report the best result among the set {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} of the regularization parameter. For BPG and BAPG, we use the constant step size 5 and \u03c1 = 0.1 respectively. For FW, we use the default implementation in the PythonOT package (see Appendix D). All the experiment results reported here were the average of 5 independent trials over different random seeds and the standard deviation is collected in Appendix. Database Statistics We test all methods on both synthetic and real-world databases. Our setup for the synthetic database is the same as in (Xu et al., 2019b). The source graph Gs = {Vs,Es} is generated by two ideal random models, Gaussian random partition and Barabasi-Albert models, with different scales, i.e., \u2223Vs\u2223 \u2208 {500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500}. Then, we generate the target graph Gt by adding more than q% nodes and edges on top of the source graph, where q \u2208 {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. For each setup, we generate five synthetic graph pairs over different random seeds. To sum up, the synthetic database contains 300 different graph pairs. We also validate our proposed methods on other three real-world databases from (Chowdhury & Needham, 2021), including two biological graph databases Proteins and Enzymes, and a social network database Reddit. Furthermore, to demonstrate the robustness of our method regarding the noise level, we follow the noise generating process (i.e., q = 10%) conducted for the synthesis case to create new databases on top of the three real-world databases. Towards that end, the statistics of all databases used for the graph alignment task have been summarized in Appendix D. We match each node in Gs with the most likely node in Gt according to the optimized \u03c0\u22c6. Given the predicted correspondence set Spred and the ground-truth correspondence set Sgt, we calculate the matching accuracy by Acc = \u2223Sgt \u2229 Spred\u2223/\u2223Sgt\u2223 \u00d7 100%. Results of Our Methods Table 2 shows the comparison of matching accuracy and wall-clock time on four databases. We observe that BAPG works exceptionally well both in terms of computational time and accuracy, especially for two large-scale noisy graph databases Synthetic and Reddit. Notably, BAPG is robust enough so that it is not necessary to perform parameter tuning. As we mentioned in Sec 2, the effectiveness of GPU acceleration for BAPG is also well corroborated on Synthetic and Reddit. GPU cannot further speed up the training time of Proteins and Reddit as graphs in these two databases are small-scale. Additional experiment results to demonstrate the robustness of BAPG and its GPU acceleration will be given in Sec 4.4. Comparison with Other Methods The performance of eBPG and ScalaGW are influenced by the entropic regularization parameter and approximation error respectively, which accounts for their poor performance. Moreover, it is easy to observe that SpecGW works pretty well on the small dataset but the performance degrades dramatically on the large one, e.g., synthetic. The reason is that SpecGW relies on a linear programming solver as its subroutine, which is not well-suited for large-scale settings. Besides, although ScalaGW has the lowest per-iteration computational complexity, the recursive K-partition mechanism developed in (Xu et al., 2019a) is not friendly to parallel computing. Therefore, ScalaGW does not demonstrate attractive performance on multi-core processors. 4.3 GRAPH PARTITION: The GW distance can also be potentially applied to the graph partition task. That is, we are trying to match the source graph with a disconnected target graph having K isolated and self-connected super nodes, where K is the number of clusters (Abrishami et al., 2020). Similarly, we compare the proposed BAPG with other baselines described in Section 4.2 on four real-world graph partitioning datasets. Parameters Setup For the input distance matrices DX and DY , we test our methods on both the adjacent matrices and the heat kernel matrices proposed in (Chowdhury & Needham, 2021). For BAPG, we pick up the lowest converged function value among \u03c1 \u2208 {0.1, 0.05, 0.01} for adjacent matrices and \u03c1 \u2208 {0.01, 0.005, 0.001} for heat kernel matrices. The quality of graph partition results is quantified by computing the adjusted mutual information (AMI) score (Vinh et al., 2010) against the ground-truth partition. Results of All Methods Table 3 shows the comparison of AMI scores among all methods on graph partition. BAPG outperforms other methods in most cases and is more robust to the noisy setting. Specifically, BAPG is consistently better than FW and SpecGW which both rely on the Frank-Wolfe method to solve the problem. eBPG has comparable results using the adjacency matrices but is unable to process the spectral matrices. The possible reason is that the adjacency matrix and the heat kernel matrix admit quite different structures, e.g., the former is sparse while the latter is dense. BPG and BPG-S enjoy similar performances in most cases, but both are not as good as our proposed BAPG on all datasets. Except for BPG and eBPG, others are pure heuristic methods without any theoretical guarantee. 4.4 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ROBUSTNESS OF BAPG: At first, we target at demonstrating the robustness of BAPG on graph alignment, as it would be more reasonable to test the robustness of a method on a database (e.g., graph alignment) rather than a single point (e.g., graph partition). Noise Level and Graph Scale At the beginning, we report the sensitivity analysis of BAPG regarding the noise level q% and the graph scale \u2223Vs\u2223 in Fig. 2 on the Synthetic Database. Surprisingly, the solution performance of BAPG is robust to both the noise level and graph scale. In contrast, the accuracy of other methods degrades dramatically as the noise level or the graph scale increases. Step Size \u03c1 Subsequently, we conduct the sensitivity analysis of BAPG with respect to the step size \u03c1 on four real-world databases. Table 4 showcases that the matching performance of BAPG is stable and robust regarding the step size. Moreover, convergence curves of different \u03c1 in Fig. 2 corroborate Proposition 3.3 empirically and further guide us on how to choose the step size. The larger \u03c1 means the smaller infeasibility error but slower convergence speed. Together with Table 4, we can conclude that if the resulting infeasibility error is not quite large (i.e., the step size \u03c1 is not so small), the final matching accuracy is robust to the step size. Under this situation, the step size only affects the convergence speed. GPU Acceleration of BAPG. We conduct experiment results to further justify that BAPG is GPU-friendly. In Table 5, We compare the acceleration ratio (i.e., CPU wall-clock time divided by GPU wall-clock time) of BAPG, eBPG, and BPG on two large-scale graph alignment datasets using the same computing server. For eBPG, we use the official implementation in the PythonOT package, which supports running on GPU. For BPG, we implement the GPU version by ourselves using Pytorch. We can find that BAPG has a much higher acceleration ratio on the GPU compared with BPG and eBPG. 5 CLOSING REMARK: In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on developing the provable single-loop algorithm (i.e., BAPG) for the GW distance computation. By exploiting the error bound condition (i.e., never investigated in the GW literature before), we are able to conduct the convergence analysis of BAPG. For a broader viewpoint, our work also takes the first step and provides a rather new path to study the alternating projected descent method for general nonconvex problems. To the best of our knowledge, it is still an open question even in the optimization community. On the computational side, the proposed single-loop algorithm BAPG still suffers from the cubic per-iteration computational complexity, which will further limit its applications in real-world large-scale settings. A natural future direction is to consider sparse and low-rank structures of the matching matrix to decrease the per-iteration cost and further speed up our method (Scetbon et al., 2021). A APPENDIX: Overall, the norm \u2225 \u22c5 \u2225 means \u21132 norm. Both dist and proj are defined w.r.t. \u21132 norm, i.e., for any convex set C and a point x, dist(x,C) =min y\u2208C \u2225x \u2212 y\u22252, (10) projC(x) = argmin y\u2208C \u2225x \u2212 y\u22252. (11) B PROBLEM PROPERTIES OF (1): In this paper, we consider the discrete case, where only m,n samples are drawn from real distributions, i.e., \u00b5 = \u2211ni=1 \u00b5i\u03b4xi and \u03bd = \u2211mj=1 \u03bdj\u03b4yj . The Gromov-Wasserstein distance between \u00b5 and \u03bd can be recast into the following minimization problem: min \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) x \u2223dX(x,x\u2032) \u2212 dY (y, y\u2032)\u22232d\u03c0(x, y)d\u03c0(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u21d2 min \u03c0\u2208\u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 \u2223dX(xi,xj) \u2212 dY (yk, yl)\u22232\u03c0ik\u03c0jl, where \u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) is a generalized Birkhoff polytope, i.e., \u03a0(\u00b5,\u03bd) = {\u03c0 \u2208 Rn\u00d7m+ \u2223\u03c01m = \u00b5,\u03c0T 1 = \u03bd}. To further simplify the problem and detect the hidden structures, we reformulate it as a compact form, n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 (DX(i, j) \u2212DY (k, l))2\u03c0ik\u03c0jl = n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 (D2X(i, j) +D2Y (k, l))\u03c0ik\u03c0jl \u2212 2 n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 DX(i, j)DY (k, l)\u03c0ik\u03c0jl = n \u2211 i=1 n \u2211 j=1 D2X(i, j)\u00b5i\u00b5j + m \u2211 k=1 m \u2211 l=1 D2Y (k, l)\u03bdk\u03bdl \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 constant \u22122Tr(DX\u03c0DY \u03c0T ). where DX(i, j) = dX(xi,xj) and DY (k, l) = dY (yk, yl) for i, j \u2208 [n] and k, l \u2208 [m]. Thus, (1) is obtained. Proof of Proposition 3.1 \u2014 Luo-Tseng Error Bound Condition for the GW Problem (1) Proof. Dx and DY are two symmetric matrices and C1 \u2229C2 is a convex polyhedral set. By invoking Theorem 2.3 in [24], the Luo-Tseng local error bound condition (6) just holds for the feasible set C1 \u2229C2. That is, dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 , (12) where \u03c0 \u2208 C1 \u2229C2. Then, we aim at extending (12) to the whole space. Define \u03c0\u0303 = projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0), we have dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 + d(\u03c0\u0303,X ) \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 + \u03c4\u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 (13) where the first inequality holds because of the triangle inequality, and the second one holds because of the fact \u03c0\u0303 \u2208 C1 \u2229C2 and (12). Apply the triangle inequality again, we have \u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 \u2264\u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 + \u2225projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 (14) Since \u03c0\u0303 = projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0), owing to the fact that the projection operator onto a convex set projC1\u2229C2(\u22c5) is non-expensive, i.e., \u2225projC1\u2229C2(x) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(y)\u2225 \u2264 \u2225x \u2212 y\u2225 holds for any x and y, we have \u2225\u03c0\u0303 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 = \u2225projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ))\u2225 \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225, (15) and \u2225projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 \u2264 \u2225(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY ) \u2212 (\u03c0\u0303 +DX \u03c0\u0303DY )\u2225 \u2264 (\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + 1)\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 (16) where \u03c3max(DX) and \u03c3max(DY ) denote the maximum singular value of DX and DY , respectively. By substituting (14) and (16) into (13), we get dist(\u03c0,X ) \u2264 (\u03c4\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + \u03c4 + 1)\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 + \u03c4\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 \u2264 (\u03c4\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + 2\u03c4 + 1)\u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225 (17) where the last inequality holds because of the fact that \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0303\u2225 = \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0)\u2225 = minx\u2208C1\u2229C2 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 x\u2225 \u2264 \u2225\u03c0 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 +DX\u03c0DY )\u2225. By letting \u03c4 = \u03c4\u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ) + 2\u03c4 + 1, we get the desired result. C CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS OF BAPG: Assumption C.1. The critical point set X is non-empty. Definition C.2 (Bregman Divergence). We define the proximity measure Dh \u2236 dom(h) \u00d7 int(dom(h))\u2192 R+ Dh(x, y) \u2236= h(x) \u2212 h(y) \u2212 \u27e8\u2207h(y),x \u2212 y\u27e9 The proximity measure Dh is the so-called Bregman Distance. It measures the proximity between x and y. Indeed, thanks to the gradient inequality, one has h is convex if and only if Dh(x, y) \u2265 0,\u2200x \u2208 domh, y \u2208 int domh. Concrete Examples \u2022 Relative entropy, or Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, h(x) = \u2211i xi logxi and the Bregman divergence is given as Dh(x, y) =\u2211 i xi log xi yi . \u2022 Quadratic function: h(x) = 1 2 \u2225x\u22252. As such, the Bregman divergence Dh(x, y) will reduce to the Euclidean distance. For the completeness of our algorithmic development, we also give the details how the general BAPG (5) update implies (2) if we choose the Legendre function as relative entropy. \u03c0k+1 = argmin \u03c0\u2208C1 {\u2212\u27e8\u03c0,DY wkDY \u27e9 + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0,wk)} = argmin \u03c0\u2208C1 Dh (\u03c0,wk \u2299 exp( DXw kDY \u03c1 )) , = diag(\u00b5./P k1m)P k, where P k = wk \u2299 exp (DXw kDY \u03c1 ). wk+1 = argmin w\u2208C2 {\u2212\u27e8w,DX\u03c0k+1DY \u27e9 + \u03c1Dh(w,\u03c0k+1)} = argmin w\u2208C2 Dh (w,\u03c0k+1 \u2299 exp( DX\u03c0 k+1DY \u03c1 )) , = Zkdiag(\u03bd./ZkT 1n), where Zk = \u03c0k+1 \u2299 exp (DX\u03c0 k+1DY \u03c1 ). The optimality conditions for each iteration follow, \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 0 \u2208 \u2212DXwkDY + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)) +NC1(\u03c0k+1), 0 \u2208 \u2212DX\u03c0k+1DY + \u03c1(\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1)) +NC2(wk+1). (18) Proof of Lemma 3.2 Proof. To prove \u2225projC1(x) + projC2(y) \u2212 2projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )\u2225 \u2a7dM \u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y)\u2225 , (19) we first convert the left-hand side of (19) to \u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 ) + projC2(y) \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )\u2225 \u2264 \u221a 2\u2225(projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 ) , projC1\u2229C2 ( x + y 2 )) \u2212 (projC1(x), projC2(y))\u2225 . Then, the inequality can be regarded as the stability of the optimal solution for a linear-quadratic problem, i.e., (p(r), q(r)) = argmin p,q 1 2 \u2225x \u2212 p\u22252 + 1 2 \u2225y \u2212 q\u22252 s.t. p \u2212 q = r, p \u2208 C1, q \u2208 C2. (20) When r = 0, the pair (p(0), q(0)) satisfies p(0) = q(0) = projC1\u2229C2 ( x+y 2 ). Moreover, the parameter r itself can be viewed as the perturbation quantity, which is indeed the right-hand side of (19). By invoking Theorem 4.1 in (Zhang & Luo, 2022), we can bound the distance between two optimal solutions by the perturbation quantity r, i.e., \u2225(p(0), q(0)) \u2212 (p(r), q(r))\u2225 \u2264M\u2225r\u2225. Remark C.3. For any vector r, let (p(r), q(r)) be the optimal solution to (20). On the one hand, choosing r = 0, it is easy to see that p(0) = q(0) = projC1\u2229C2( x+y 2 ). On the other hand, by choosing r = projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y), it is easy to see that (p(r), q(r)) = (projC1(x), projC2(y)). Since Theorem 4.1 in (Zhang & Luo, 2022) implies that for any r, we have \u2225(p(0), q(0)) \u2212 (p(r), q(r))\u22252 \u2264M\u2225r\u22252 where M only depends on C1 and C2. By choosing r = projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y), we have \u2225(projC1\u2229C2( x + y 2 ), projC1\u2229C2( x + y 2 )) \u2212 (projC1(x), projC2(y)) \u2264M\u2225projC1(x) \u2212 projC2(y)\u22252. Proof of Proposition 3.3 \u2014 Approximation bound of fixed points of BAPG Definition C.4 (Bounded Linear Regularity (cf. Definition 5.6 in Bauschke (1996))). Let C1, . . . ,CN be closed convex subsets of Rn with a non-empty intersection C. We say that the collection {C1, . . . ,CN} is bounded linearly regular (BLR) if for every bounded subset B of Rn, there exists a constant \u03ba > 0 such that d(x,C) \u2264 \u03ba max i\u2208{1,...,N} d(x,Ci), for all x \u2208 B. If all of Ci are polyhedral sets, the BLR condition will automatically hold. Proof. Recall the fixed-point set of BAPG: XBAPG = {(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) \u2236 \u2207f(w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6)) + p = 0,p \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6)) + q = 0, q \u2208 NC2(w\u22c6) } . (21) Define \u03c0\u0302 = projC1\u2229C2(\u03c0 \u22c6), we first want to argue the following inequality holds, \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)\u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225. As the BLR condition is satisfied for the polyhedral constraint, see Definition C.4 for details, we have \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 2\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 = 2dist(\u03c0\u22c6,C1 \u2229C2) + \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)\u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225. (22) Based on the stationary points defined in (8), we have, \u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6))T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + pT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) = 0,p \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6), \u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6))T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) + qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) = 0, q \u2208 NC2(w\u22c6). Summing up the above two equations, \u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u22c6) \u2212\u2207h(w\u22c6))T (w\u22c6 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + pT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) = 0 (\u2663) \u21d2\u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) \u2212 \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) +Dh(w\u22c6,\u03c0\u22c6)) + pT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) + qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) = 0 (\u2660) \u21d2\u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) \u2212 \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) +Dh(w\u22c6,\u03c0\u22c6)) \u2265 0, where (\u2663) holds as (\u2207h(x) \u2212 \u2207h(y))T (x \u2212 y) = Dh(x, y) +Dh(y,x) and (\u2660) follows from the property of the normal cone. For instance, since q \u2208 NC1(\u03c0\u22c6), we have qT (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) \u2264 0 (i.e., \u03c0\u0302 \u2208 C1). Therefore, \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) +Dh(w\u22c6,\u03c0\u22c6)) \u2264 \u2207f(w\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6) +\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)T (\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6) \u2264 \u2225\u2207f(w\u22c6)\u2225\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u2207f(\u03c0\u22c6)\u2225\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 Lf(\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0\u22c6\u2225 + \u2225\u2225\u03c0\u0302 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225) (22) \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)Lf\u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225. The next to last inequality holds as f(\u22c5) is a quadratic function and the effective domain C1 \u2229 C2 is bounded. Thus, the norm of its gradient will naturally have a constant upper bound, i.e., Lf = \u03c3max(DX)\u03c3max(DY ). As h is a \u03c3-strongly convex, we have Dh(\u03c0\u22c6,w\u22c6) \u2265 \u03c3 2 \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u22252. Together with this property, we can quantify the infeasibility error \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225, \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)Lf \u03b4\u03c1 . (23) When \u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e, it is easy to observe that the infeasibility error term \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225 will shrink to zero. More importantly, if \u03c0\u22c6 = w\u22c6, then XBAPG will be identical to X . Next, we target at quantifying the approximation gap between the fixed-point set of BAPG and the critical point set of the original problem (1). Upon (21), we have \u2207f (\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ) + p + q 2 = 0, where \u2207f(\u22c5) is a linear operator. By applying the Luo-Tseng local error bound condition of (1), i.e., Proposition 3.1, we have dist(\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ,X) \u2264 \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( \u03c0\u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 \u2212\u2207f (\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ))\u2225 = \u03c4 \u2225\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 \u2212 projC1\u2229C2 ( \u03c0\u22c6 + p +w\u22c6 + q 2 )\u2225 (\u2663)= \u03c4 2 \u2225projC1(\u03c0 \u22c6 + p) + projC1(w \u22c6 + q) \u2212 2projC1\u2229C2 ( \u03c0\u22c6 + p +w\u22c6 + q 2 )\u2225 (\u2660) \u2264 M\u03c4 2 \u2225\u03c0\u22c6 \u2212w\u22c6\u2225, where (\u2663) holds due to the normal cone property, that is, projC(x + z) = x for any x \u2208 C and z \u2208 NC(x), and (\u2660) follows from Lemma 3.2. Incorporating with (23), the approximation bound for BAPG has been characterized quantitatively, i.e., dist(\u03c0 \u22c6 +w\u22c6 2 ,X) \u2264 (2\u03ba + 1)LfM 2\u03b4\u03c1 . Proof of Proposition 3.5 \u2014 Sufficient decrease property of BAPG Proof. We first observe from the optimality conditions of main updates, i.e., 0 \u2208 \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)) + \u2202g1(\u03c0k+1) (24) 0 \u2208 \u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk) + \u03c1(\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1)) + \u2202g2(wk+1) (25) where g1(\u03c0) = I{\u03c0\u2208C1} and g2(w) = I{w\u2208C2}. Due to the convexity of g1(\u22c5), it is natural to obtain, g1(\u03c0k) \u2212 g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2265 \u2212\u27e8\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)),\u03c0k \u2212 \u03c0k+1\u27e9 = \u2212\u27e8\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk),\u03c0k \u2212 \u03c0k+1\u27e9 + \u27e8\u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk)),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9 As f(\u03c0,w) = \u2212tr(DX\u03c0DY wT ) is a bilinear function, we have, f(\u03c0k,wk) \u2212 f(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212 \u27e8\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk),\u03c0k \u2212 \u03c0k+1\u27e9 = 0. Consequently, we get f(\u03c0k,wk) + g1(\u03c0k) \u2212 f(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212 g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2265 \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9. (26) Similarly, based on the w-update, we obtain f(\u03c0k+1,wk)+g2(wk)\u2212f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)\u2212g2(wk+1) \u2265 \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(wk+1)\u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1),wk+1 \u2212wk\u27e9. (27) Combine with (26) and (27), we obtain f(\u03c0k,wk) + g1(\u03c0k) + g2(wk) \u2212 f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212 g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2212 g2(wk+1) \u2265 \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9 + \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1),wk+1 \u2212wk\u27e9. (28) The right-hand side can be further simplified, \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(\u03c0k+1) \u2212\u2207h(wk),\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u27e9 + \u03c1\u27e8\u2207h(wk+1) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0k+1),wk+1 \u2212wk\u27e9 (\u2663)= \u03c1(Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) +Dh(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212Dh(\u03c0k,wk)) + \u03c1(Dh(wk,wk+1)+ Dh(wk+1,\u03c0k+1) \u2212Dh(wk,\u03c0k+1)) (\u2660)= \u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) + \u03c1Dh(wk,wk+1) \u2212 \u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,wk) + \u03c1Dh(\u03c0k+1,wk+1). Here, (\u2663) uses the fact that the three-point property of Bregman divergence holds, i.e., For any y, z \u2208 int domh and x \u2208 domh, Dh(x, z) \u2212Dh(x, y) \u2212Dh(y, z) = \u27e8\u2207h(y) \u2212\u2207h(z),x \u2212 y\u27e9. Moreover, (\u2660) holds as Dh(\u22c5, \u22c5) is symmetric on the whole sequence. To proceed, this together with (28) implies F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212 F\u03c1(\u03c0k,wk) \u2264 \u2212\u03c1Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) \u2212 \u03c1Dh(wk,wk+1). (29) Summing up (29) from k = 0 to +\u221e, we obtain F\u03c1(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) \u2212 F\u03c1(\u03c00,w0) \u2264 \u2212\u03ba1 \u221e \u2211 k=0 (Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) +Dh(wk,wk+1)) . As the potential function F\u03c1(\u22c5, \u22c5) is coercive and {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 is a bounded sequence, it means the left-hand side is bounded, which implies \u221e \u2211 k=0 (Dh(\u03c0k,\u03c0k+1) +Dh(wk,wk+1)) < +\u221e. Proof of Theorem 3.6 \u2014 Subsequence convergence result of BAPG Proof. Let (\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) be a limit point of the sequence {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650. Then, there exists a sequence {nk}k\u22650 such that {(\u03c0nk ,wnk)}k\u22650 converges to (\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e). Replacing k by nk in (24) and (25), taking limits on both sides as k \u2192\u221e 0 \u2208 \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) + \u03c1(\u2207h(\u03c0\u221e) \u2212\u2207h(w\u221e)) + \u2202g1(\u03c0\u221e) 0 \u2208 \u2207wf(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) + \u03c1(\u2207h(w\u221e) \u2212\u2207h(\u03c0\u221e)) + \u2202g2(w\u221e). Based on the fact that \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) = \u2207f(w\u221e) and \u2207wf(\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) = \u2207f(\u03c0\u221e), it can be easily concluded that (\u03c0\u221e,w\u221e) \u2208 XBAPG. More importantly, the above subsequence convergence result can be extended to the global convergence if the Legendre function h(\u22c5) is quadratic. Theorem C.5 (Global Convergence of BAPG \u2014 Quadratic Case). The sequence {(\u03c0k,wk)}k\u22650 converges to a critical point of F\u03c1(\u03c0,w). Proof. To invoke the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz analysis framework developed in (Attouch et al., 2010; 2013), we have to establish two crucial properties \u2014 sufficient decrease and safeguard condition. The first one has already been proven in Proposition 3.5. Then, we would like to show that there exists a constant \u03ba2 such that, dist(0,\u2202F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)) \u2264 \u03ba2(\u2225\u03c0k+1 \u2212 \u03c0k\u2225 + \u2225wk+1 \u2212wk\u2225). At first, noting that \u2202F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) = \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) + \u03c1(\u03c0k+1 \u2212wk+1) + \u2202g1(\u03c0k+1) \u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) + \u03c1(wk+1 \u2212 \u03c0k+1) + \u2202g2(wk+1) \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 . Again, together with the updates (24) and (25), this implies dist2(0,\u2202F\u03c1(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)) \u2264 \u2225\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k+1,wk+1) \u2212\u2207\u03c0f(\u03c0k,wk)\u22252 + \u03c1\u2225wk \u2212wk+1\u22252 + \u2225\u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk) \u2212\u2207wf(\u03c0k+1,wk+1)\u22252 \u2264 (\u03c32max(DX)\u03c32max(DY ) + \u03c1)\u2225wk \u2212wk+1\u22252, where \u03c3max(\u22c5) denotes the maximum singular value. By letting \u03ba2 = \u221a \u03c32max(DX)\u03c32max(DY ) + \u03c1, we get the desired result.
