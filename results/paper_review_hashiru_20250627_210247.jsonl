The paper title is: Anamnesic Neural Differential Equations with Orthogonal Polynomial Projections\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Time series are ubiquitous in many fields of science such as healthcare, finance and biology, and as such, represent an important but challenging data modality for machine learning. Indeed, their temporal nature, along with the potentially high dimensionality makes them arduous to manipulate as mathematical objects. A long-standing line of research has thus focused on efforts in learning informative time series representations, such as simple vectors, that are capable of capturing local and global structure in such data (Franceschi et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020). Such architectures include recurrent neural networks (Malhotra et al., 2017), temporal transformers (Zhou et al., 2021) and neural ordinary differential equations (Rubanova et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018). In particular, neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) have emerged as a popular choice for time series modelling due to their sequential nature and their ability to handle irregularly sampled time-series data. Sequential processing, as opposed to parallel transformer architectures, allows to us update the time series representation as new observations are reached. By positing an underlying continuous time dynamic process, Neural ODEs sequentially process irregularly sampled time series via numerical integration of the dynamics between observations. In doing so, they update the hidden representation for each new choice of observation. The flexibility of this model family arises from the use of neural networks to parameterize the dynamics function, and different choices of parameterizations of the dynamics function can have different properties. For instance, bounding the output of the neural networks can enforce Lipschitz constants over the temporal process (De Brouwer et al., 2019; Onken et al., 2021). The problem this work tackles is that the piece-wise integration of the latent process between observations can fail to retain a global representation of the time series. Specifically, each change to the hidden state of the dynamical system from a new observation can result in a loss of memory about prior dynamical states the model was originally in. This pathology limits the utility of Neural ODEs when there is a necessity to retain information about the recent and distant past; i.e. current Neural ODE formulations are amnesic. We illustrate this effect in Figure 1, where we see that backward integration of a learned Neural ODE (that is competent at forecasting) quickly diverges, indicating the state only retains sufficient local information about the future dynamics. One strategy that has been explored in the past to address this pathology is to regularize the model to encourage it to capture long-range patterns by reconstructing the time series from the last observation, using an auto-encoder architecture(Rubanova et al., 2019; Tschannen et al., 2018). This class of approaches results in higher complexity and does not provide any guarantees on the retention of the history of a time series. In contrast, our work proposes an alternative parameterization of the dynamics function that, by design, captures long-range memory within a Neural ODE. We achieve this by enforcing that the dynamics of the hidden process follow the dynamics of the projection of the observed temporal process onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. The resulting model, PolyODE, thereby ensures encoding of long-range past information in the latent process and is thus anamnesic. As depicted in Figure 1, the resulting time series embeddings are able to reconstruct the past time series with significantly better accuracy. Contributions \u2022 We propose a novel dynamics function for a neural ODE resulting in PolyODE, a model that learns a global representation of high-dimensional time series and is capable of longterm forecasting and reconstruction by design. \u2022 Methodologically, we highlight the practical challenges in learning PolyODE and show how adaptive solvers for ODEs can overcome them. Theoretically, we provide bounds characterizing the quality of reconstruction of time series when using PolyODE. \u2022 Empirically, we study the performance of our approach by assessing the ability of the learnt embeddings to reconstruct the past of the time series and by studying their utility as inputs for downstream predictive tasks. We show that our model provides better time series representations, relative to several existing Neural ODEs architectures, based on the ability of the representations to accurately make predictions on several downstream tasks based on chaotic time series and irregularly sampled data from patients in intensive care units. 2 RELATED WORK: Time series modelling in machine learning: There is vast literature on the use of machine learning for time series modelling and we highlight some of the ideas that have been explored to adapt diverse kinds of models for irregular time series data. Although not naturally well suited to learning representations of such data, there have been modifications proposed to discrete-time models such as recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014) to handle such data. Models such as mTANs (Shukla and Marlin, 2021) leverage an attention-based approach to interpolate sequences to create discrete-time data from irregularly sampled data). Another strategy has been architectural modifications to the recurrence equations e.g. CT-GRU (Mozer et al., 2017), GRU-D (Che et al., 2018) and Unitary RNNs (Arjovsky et al., 2016). Much more closely aligned to our work, and a natural fit for irregularly sampled data is research that uses differential equations to model continuous-time processes(Chen et al., 2018). By parameterizing the derivative of a time series using neural networks and integrating the dynamics over unobserved time points, this class of models is well suited to handle irregularly sampled data. This includes models such as ODERNN (Rubanova et al., 2019), ODE-LSTM (Lechner and Hasani, 2020) and Neural CDE (Kidger et al., 2020). ODE-based approaches require the use of differential equation solvers during training and inference, which can come at the cost of runtime (Shukla and Marlin, 2021). PolyODEs lie in this family of models; specifically, this work proposes a new parameterization of the dynamics function and a practical method for learning that enables this model family to accurately forecast the future and reconstruct the past greatly enhancing the scope and utility of the learned embeddings. Orthogonal polynomials: PolyODEs are inspired by a rich line of work in orthogonal decomposition of time series data. Orthogonal polynomials have been a mainstay in the toolkit for engineering (Heuberger et al., 2003) and uncertainty quantification (Li et al., 2011). In the context of machine learning, the limitations of RNNs to retain long-term memory have been studied empirically and theoretically (Zhao et al., 2020). Indeed, the GRU (Chung et al., 2014) and LSTM (Graves et al., 2007) architectures were created in part to improve the long-term memory of such models. Recent approaches for discrete-time models have used orthogonal polynomials and their ability to represent temporal processes in a memory-efficient manner. The Legendre Memory Unit (Voelker et al., 2019) can be seen as a projection of data onto Legendre polynomials within the recurrence equation of RNNs. The HiPPo framework and its S4 extension (Gu et al., 2020; 2021) present an overarching generalization of this and related (Zhang et al., 2018) ideas to Legendre, Laguerre or Chebyshev polynomials. LMUs, HiPPO and S4 all rely on a linear interpolation in between observations and perform the projection on the hidden space of the model. This prevents this approach from producing accurate time series reconstruction in general and informative embedding for sparsely observed time series. Despite attempts to improve the computational performance of learning from long-term sequences (Morrill et al., 2021), we are not aware of approaches that leverage orthogonal polynomials to improve long-term memory for continuous time models. 3 BACKGROUND: Orthogonal Polynomial Projections: Orthogonal polynomials are defined with respect to a measure \u00b5 as a sequence of polynomials {P0(s), P1(s), ...} such that deg(Pi) = i and hPn, Pmi = Z Pn(s)Pm(s)d\u00b5(s) = n=m\u21b5n. (1) For simplicity, we consider only absolutely continuous measures with respect to the Lebesgue measure, such that there exists a weight function !(\u00b7) such that d\u00b5(s) = !(s)ds. The measure \u00b5 determines the class of polynomials obtained from the conditions above (Eq. 1). Examples include Legendre, Hermite or Laguerre classes of orthogonal polynomials. The measure \u00b5 also defines an inner product h\u00b7, \u00b7i\u00b5 such that the orthogonal projection of a 1-dimensional continuous process f(\u00b7) : R! R on the space of polynomials of degree N , PN is given as fN (t) = NX n=0 cnPn(t) 1 \u21b5n with cn = hf, Pni\u00b5 = Z f(s)Pn(s)d\u00b5(s). (2) This projection minimizes the distance kf pk\u00b5 for all p 2 PN and is thus optimal with respect to the measure \u00b5. One can thus encode a process f by storing its projection coefficients {c0, ..., cN}. We write the vector of coefficients up to degree N as c (the degree N is omitted) and ci = ci. Intuitively, the measure assigns different weights at times of the process and thus allows for modulating the importance of different parts of the input signal for the reconstruction. Continuous update of approximation coefficients: The projection of a process f onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials provides an optimal representation for reconstruction. However, there is often a need to update this representation continuously as new observations of the process f become available. Let f<t be the temporal process observed up until time t. We wish to compute the coefficients of this process at different times t. We can define for this purpose a time-varying measure \u00b5t and corresponding weight function !t that can incorporate our requirements in terms of reconstruction abilities over time. For instance, if one cares about reconstruction of a process temporal units in the past, one could use a time-varying weight function !t(s) = I[s 2 (t , t)] and corresponding measure. This time-varying measure induces a time-varying basis of orthogonal polynomials P tn for n = 0, ..., N . We can define the time-varying orthogonal projection and its coefficients cn(t) as f<t \u21e1 f<t,N = NX n=0 cn(t)P t n 1 \u21b5tn with cn(t) = hf<t, P tni\u00b5t = Z f<t(s)P t n(s)d\u00b5 t(s). (3) Dynamics of the projection coefficients: Computing the coefficients of the projection at each time step would be both computationally wasteful and would require storing the whole time series in memory, going against the principle of sequential updates to the model. Instead, we can leverage the fact that the coefficients evolve according to known linear dynamics over time. Remarkably, for a wide range of time-varying measures \u00b5t, Gu et al. (2020) show that the coefficients cN (t) follow: dcn(t) dt = d dt Z f<t(s)P t n(s)d\u00b5 t(s), 8n 2 N dc(t) dt = A\u00b5c(t) +B\u00b5f(t) (4) where A and B are fixed matrices (for completeness, we provide a derivation of the relation in Appendix A). Using the dynamics of Eq. 4, it is possible to update the coefficients of the projection sequentially by only using the new incoming sample f(t), while retaining the desired reconstruction abilities. Gu et al. (2020) use a discretization of the above dynamics to model discrete timesequential data via a recurrent neural network architecture. Specifically, their architecture projects the hidden representation of an RNN onto a single time series that is projected onto an polynomial basis. Our approach differs in two ways. First, we work with a continuous time model. Second, we jointly model the evolution of d-dimensional time-varying process as a overparameterized hidden representation that uses orthogonal projections to serve as memory banks. The resulting model is a new Neural ODE architecture as we detail below. 4 METHODOLOGY: Problem Setup. We consider a collection of sequences of temporal observations x = {(xi,mi, ti) : i 2 {1, ..., T}} that consist of a set of time-stamped observations and masks (xi 2 Rd,mi 2 Rd, ti 2 R). We write xi,j and mi,j for the value of the jth dimension of xi and mi respectively. The mask mi encodes the presence of each dimension at a specific time point. We set mi,j = 1 if xi,j is observed and mi,j = 0 otherwise. The number of observations for each sequence x, T , can vary across sequences. We define the set of sequences as S and the distance between two time series observed at the same times as d(x,x0) = 1T PT i kxi x0ik2. Our goal is to be able to embed a sequence x into a vector h 2 Rdh such that (1) h retains a maximal amount of information contained in x and (2) h is informative for downstream prediction tasks. We formalize both objectives below. Definition (Reverse reconstruction). Given an embedding ht of a time series x at time t, we define the reverse reconstruction x\u0302<t as the predicted values of the time series at times prior to t. We write the observed time series prior to t as x<t. Objective 1 (Long memory representation). Let ht and h0t be two embeddings of the same time series x. Let x\u0302<t and x\u03020<t be their reverse reconstruction. We say that ht enjoys more memory than h0t if d(x\u0302<t,x<t) < d(x\u03020<t,x<t). Objective 2 (Downstream task performance). Let y 2 Rdy be an auxiliary vector drawn from a unknown distribution depending on x. Let y\u0302(x) and y\u0302(x)0 be the predictions obtained from embeddings ht and h0t. For a performance metric \u21b5 : S \u21e5 Rdy ! R, we say that ht is more informative than h0t if Ex,y[\u21b5(y\u0302(x),y)] > Ex,y[\u21b5(y\u0302(x)0,y)]. 4.1 POLYODE: ANAMNESIC NEURAL ODES: We make the assumption that the observed time series x comes from an unknown but continuous temporal process x(t). Given h(t) 2 Rdh and a read-out function g : Rdh ! Rd we posit the following generative process for the data: x(t) = g(h(t)), dh(t) dt = (h(t)) (5) where part of (\u00b7) is parametrized via a neural network \u2713(\u00b7). The augmentation of the state space is a known technique to improve the expressivity of Neural ODEs (Dupont et al., 2019). Here, to ensure that the hidden representation in our model has the capacity to retain long-term memory, we augment the state space of our model by including the dynamics of coefficients of orthogonal polynomials as described in Equation 4. We structure the hidden state as h(t) = [h0(t),h1(t), . . . ,hd(t)] where h0(t) 2 Rd has the same dimension as the input process x, hi(t) 2 RN , 8i 2 1, . . . , d, has the same dimension as the vector of projection coefficients ci(t) and [\u00b7, \u00b7] is the concatenation operator. We define the readout function gi(\u00b7) : R(N+1)d ! R such that gi(h(t)) = h0(t)i. That is, gi is fixed and returns the ith value of the input vector. This leads to the following system of ODEs that characterize the evolution of h(t): Integration Step. 8 >>>>< >>>>: dc1(t) dt = A\u00b5c 1(t) +B\u00b5g1(h(t)) ... dcd(t) dt = A\u00b5c d(t) +B\u00b5gd(h(t)) dh(t) dt = \u2713(h(t)) (6) This parametrization allows learning arbitrarily complex dynamics for the temporal process x. We define a sub-system of equations of projection coefficients update for each dimension of the input temporal process x(t) 2 Rd. This sub-system is equivalent to Equation 4, where we have substituted the input process by the prediction from the hidden process h(t) through a mapping gi(\u00b7). The hidden process h0(t) acts similarly as in Neural ODEs and the processes c(t) captures long-range information about the observed time series. At each time step, we can provide an estimate of the time series x\u0302(t) conditioned on the hidden process h(t), with x\u0302(t) = g(h(t)). The system of equations in Eq. 6 characterises the dynamics in between observations. To easily update the state of the system when a new observation becomes available, This construction allows for the processing of new observations as follows. Update Step. At time t = ti, after observing xi and mask mi, we set \u21e2 hj(ti) := cj(ti), 8j s.t. mi,j = 1 h0(ti)j := xi,j , 8j s.t. mi,j = 1 (7) Remarks: Our model blends orthogonal polynomials with the flexibility offered in modelling the observations with NeuralODEs. The consequence of this is that while the coefficients serve as memory banks for each dimension of the time series, the Neural ODE over h0(t) can be used to forecast from the model. That said, we acknowledge that a significant limitation of our current design is the need for the hidden dimension to track N coefficients for each time-series dimension. Given that many adjacent time series might be correlated, we anticipate that methods to reduce the space footprint of the coefficients within our model is fertile ground for future work. 4.2 TRAINING: We train this architecture by minimizing the reconstruction error between the predictions and the observations: L = PT i=1kx\u0302(ti) xik22. We first initialize the hidden processes c(0) = 0 and h(0) = 0 though they can be initialized with static information b, if available (e.g. h(0) = \u2713(b)). We subsequently alternate between integration steps between observations and update steps at observation times. The loss is updated at each observation time ti. A pseudo-code description of the overall procedure is given in Algorithm 1. Numerical integration. We integrate the system of differential equations of Equation 6 using differentiable numerical solvers as introduced in Chen et al. (2018). However, one of the technical challenges that arise with learning PolyODE is that the dynamical system in Equation 6 is relatively stiff and integrating this process with acceptable precision would lead to prohibitive computation times with explicit solvers. This arises because a subset of this dynamical system is linear inhomogeneous and can be expressed in the following form: dx(t)dt = A\u00b5x(t) + f(t). Crucially, the real part of all eigenvalues of A are negative and the stiffness ratio, defined as the ratio between the largest and lowest real parts of the eigenvalues of A grows large with the degree of the polynomial approximation N . This is characteristic of stiff systems that will exhibit instabilities at large integration step sizes. To deal with this instability we used an implicit solver such as Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton for the numerical integration Sauer (2011). Algorithm 1: PolyODE Training Data: x, matrices A\u00b5, B\u00b5, number of dimensions d, number of observations T , number of polynomial coefficients N Result: Training loss L over a whole sequence x t\u21e4 0 Initialize hj(0) = cj(0) = 0N , 8j 2 1, ..., d, Loss L = 0 for i 1 to T do Integrate c1,...,d(t) and h0,..,d(t) from t = t\u21e4 until t = ti x\u0302i h0(t\u21e4) Update c1,...,d(ti) and h0,...,d(ti) with xi,mi. L = L+ k(x\u0302i xi) mik22 t\u21e4 ti end Forecasting: From time t, we forecast the time series at an arbitrary time t\u21e4 as: x\u0302>t(t \u21e4) = g(h(t) + Z t\u21e4 t \u2713(h(s))ds), (8) where \u2713(\u00b7) is the learned model that we use in the integration step and introduced in Eq. 5. Reverse Reconstruction: Using Equation 3, we can compute the reverse reconstruction of the time series at any time t using the projection coefficients part of the hidden process: x\u0302<t,j = NX n=0 cjn(t) \u00b7 P tn \u00b7 1 \u21b5tn . (9) The error between the prediction obtained during the integration step, x\u0302(t), and the above reconstruction estimator is bounded above, as Result 4.1 shows. The result addresses how well we should expect to perform reverse reconstructions after integrating forward in time over irregularly observed intervals. Result 4.1. For a shifted rectangular weighting function with width , !t(x) = 1 I[t ,t] (which generate Legendre polynomials), the mean square error between the forward (x\u0302) and reverse prediction (x\u0302<t) at each time t is bounded by: kx\u0302 x\u0302<tk2\u00b5t  C0 2L2(K + 1)2 N(2N 1) + C1 L(K + 1)SK\u21e0 \u2713 3 2 , N \u25c6 + C2S 2 K\u21e0 \u2713 3 2 , N \u25c6 , where K is the number of observations in the interval [t , t], L is the Lipschitz constant of the forward process, N is the degree of the polynomial approximation and \u21e0(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the Hurwitz zeta function. SK = PK i=1|x\u0302 xi| is the sum of absolute errors between the forward process and observations incurred at the update steps. C0, C1 and C2 are constants. Expectedly, the bound goes to 0 as the degree of the approximation increases. The lower cumulative absolute error SK also leads to a reduction of this bound. As the cumulative absolute error SK and our loss function L share the same optimum, for fixed , L, K and N , our training objective therefore implicitly enforces a minimization of the reconstruction error. This corresponds to optimizing Objective 1, where we set d(x,x0) = kx x0k2\u00b5t . Our architecture thus jointly minimizes both global reconstruction and global reconstruction error. Notably, when SK = 0, this result boils down to the well-known projection error for orthogonal polynomials projection of continuous processes (Canuto and Quarteroni, 1982). What is more, increasing the width of the weighting function (increasing ) predictably results in higher reconstruction error. However, this can be compensated by increasing the dimension of the polynomial basis accordingly. We also note a quadratic dependency on the Lipschitz constant of the temporal process, which can limit the reverse reconstruction abilities for high-frequency components. The full proof can be found in Appendix B. 5 EXPERIMENTS: We evaluate our approach on two objectives : (1) the ability of the learned embedding to encode global information about the time series, through the reverse reconstruction performance (or memorization) and (2) the ability of embedding to provide an informative input for a downstream task. We study our methods on the following datasets: Synthetic Univariate. We validate our approach using a univariate synthetic time series. We simulate 1000 realizations from this process and sample it at irregularly spaced time points using a Poisson point process with rate [ 1s ]. For each generated irregularly sampled time series x, we create a binary label y = I[x(5) > 0.5]. Further details about this dataset are to be found in Appendix F. Chaotic Attractors. Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit a large dependence of the dynamics on the initial conditions. This means that a noisy or incomplete evaluation of the state space may not contain much information about the past of the time series. We consider two widely used chaotic dynamical systems: Lorenz63 and a 5-dimensional Lorenz96. We generate 1000 irregularly sampled time series from different initial conditions. We completely remove one dimension of the time series such that the state space is never fully observed. This forces the model to remember the past trajectories to create an accurate estimate of the state space at each time t. MIMIC-IIII dataset. We use a pre-processed version of the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). This consists of the first 24 hours of follow-up for ICU patients. We use the following longitudinal variables: heart rate, mean and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cell count, temperature and creatinine. For each time series, the label y is the in-hospital mortality. Baselines: We compare our approach against two sets of baselines: Neural ODEs architecture and variants of recurrent neural networks architectures designed for long-term memory. To ensure a fair comparison, we use the same dimensionality of the hidden state for all models. Neural ODE baselines. We use a filtering implementation of Neural ODEs, GRU-ODE-Bayes (De Brouwer et al., 2019) and ODE-RNN Rubanova et al. (2019), an auto-encoder relying on a Neural ODE for both the encoder and the decoder part. Because of the additional auto-encoder loss, we expect this approach to provide more informative time-series embeddings. For theses baselines, we compute the reverse reconstruction by integrating the system of learnt ODEs backward in time. In case of ODE-RNN, we use the ODE of the decoder. Long-term memory RNN baselines. We compare against HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020), a recurrent neural network architecture that uses orthogonal polynomial projections of the hidden process. We also use a variant of this approach where we directly use the HiPPO operator on the observed time series, rather than on the hidden process. We call this variant HiPPO-obs. Long-range representation learning: For each dataset, we evaluate our method and the various baselines on different tasks. Implementation details are available in Appendix G. Downstream Classification. We train the models on the available time series. After training, we extract time series embedding from each model and use them as input to a multi-layer perceptron trained to predict the time series label y. We report the area under the operator-characteristic curve evaluated on a left-out test set with 5 repetitions. Time Series Reconstruction. Similarly as for the downstream classification, we extract the time series embeddings from models trained on the time series. We then compute the reverse reconstruction x\u0302<t and evaluate the MSE with respect to the true time series. Forecasting. We compare the ability of all models to forecast the future of the time series. We compute the embedding of the time series observed until some time tcond and predict over a horizon thorizon. We then report the MSE between the prediction and true trajectories. Results for these tasks are presented in Table 1 for Synthetic and Lorenz datasets and in Table 2 for MIMIC. We report additional results in Appendix C, with a larger array of irregular sampling rates. We observe that the reconstruction abilities of PolyODE clearly outperforms the other baselines, for all datasets under consideration. A similar trend is to be noted for the downstream classification for the synthetic and Lorenz datasets. For these datasets, accurate prediction of the label y requires a global representation of the time series, which results in better performance for our approach. For the MIMIC dataset, our approach compares favourably with the other methods for the downstream classification objective and outperforms other methods for trajectory forecasting. What is more, the reconstruction ability of PolyODE is significantly better than compared ap- proaches. To showcase this ability further, we plot in Figure 3 the reverse reconstructions of PolyODEand the true values (dotted lines) for the heart rate, mean blood pressure and oxygen saturation of a random patient over the first 24 hours in the ICU. This reconstruction is obtained by first sequentially processing the time series until t = 24 hours and subsequently using the hidden process to reconstruct the time series as in Equation 9. We observe that PolyODE can indeed capture the overall trend of the time series over the whole history. Ablation study: the importance of the auxiliary dynamical system: Is there utility to leveraging the neural network \u2713(\u00b7) to learn the dynamics of the time series? How well would various interpolation schemes for irregularly sampled observations perform in the context of reverse reconstruction and classification? In response to these questions, we first note that they do not support extrapolation and are thus incapable of forecasting the future of the time series. However, we compare the performance in terms of reverse reconstruction and classification in Table 3. We consider constant interpolation (last observation carried forward), linear interpolation and Hermite spline interpolation.Our results indicate a significant gap in performance between PolyODE and the linear and constant interpolation schemes. The Hermite spline interpolation allows us to capture most of the signal needed for the downstream classification task but results in significantly lower performance in terms of the reverse reconstruction error. These results therefore strongly support the importance of \u2713(\u00b7) for producing informative time series embeddings. Complementary results are available in Appendix C. Incorporating global time series uncertainty: Previous experiments demonstrate the ability of PolyODE to retain memory of the past trajectory. A similar capability can be obtained for capturing global model uncertainties over the time series history. This allows having specific uncertainty estimates at different points of the reconstruction. In Figure 4, we evaluate the association between the recovered uncertainties of PolyODE and the reverse reconstruction errors. We plot the predicted uncertainties against the root mean square error (RMSE) on a logarithmic scale. We compare our approach with using the uncertainty of the model at the last time step only. We observe that the uncertainties recovered by PolyODE are significantly more correlated with the errors (Pearson\u21e2 = 0.56) compared to using the uncertainties obtained from the last time step (Pearson-\u21e2 = 0.11). More details are available in Appendix E. 6 CONCLUSION: Producing time series representations that are easy to manipulate, representative of global dynamics, practically useful for downstream tasks and robust to irregular sampling remains an ongoing challenge. In this work, we took a step in that direction by proposing a simple but novel architecture that satisfies those requirements by de- sign. As a Neural ODE, PolyODE inherits the ability to handle irregular time series elegantly but at the same time, PolyODE also incurs computational cost associated with numerical integration. Currently, our approach also requires a large hidden space dimension and finding methods to address this that exploit the correlation between dimensions of the time series is a fruitful direction for future work.

Indeed, their temporal nature, along with the potentially high dimensionality makes them arduous to manipulate as mathematical objects. A long-standing line of research has thus focused on efforts in learning informative time series representations, such as simple vectors, that are capable of capturing local and global structure in such data (Franceschi et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020). Such architectures include recurrent neural networks (Malhotra et al., 2017), temporal transformers (Zhou et al., 2021) and neural ordinary differential equations (Rubanova et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018). In particular, neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) have emerged as a popular choice for time series modelling due to their sequential nature and their ability to handle irregularly sampled time-series data. Sequential processing, as opposed to parallel transformer architectures, allows to us update the time series representation as new observations are reached. By positing an underlying continuous time dynamic process, Neural ODEs sequentially process irregularly sampled time series via numerical integration of the dynamics between observations. In doing so, they update the hidden representation for each new choice of observation. The flexibility of this model family arises from the use of neural networks to parameterize the dynamics function, and different choices of parameterizations of the dynamics function can have different properties. For instance, bounding the output of the neural networks can enforce Lipschitz constants over the temporal process (De Brouwer et al., 2019; Onken et al., 2021). The problem this work tackles is that the piece-wise integration of the latent process between observations can fail to retain a global representation of the time series. Specifically, each change to the hidden state of the dynamical system from a new observation can result in a loss of memory about prior dynamical states the model was originally in. This pathology limits the utility of Neural ODEs when there is a necessity to retain information about the recent and distant past; i.e. current Neural ODE formulations are amnesic. We illustrate this effect in Figure 1, where we see that backward integration of a learned Neural ODE (that is competent at forecasting) quickly diverges, indicating the state only retains sufficient local information about the future dynamics. One strategy that has been explored in the past to address this pathology is to regularize the model to encourage it to capture long-range patterns by reconstructing the time series from the last observation, using an auto-encoder architecture(Rubanova et al., 2019; Tschannen et al., 2018). This class of approaches results in higher complexity and does not provide any guarantees on the retention of the history of a time series. In contrast, our work proposes an alternative parameterization of the dynamics function that, by design, captures long-range memory within a Neural ODE. We achieve this by enforcing that the dynamics of the hidden process follow the dynamics of the projection of the observed temporal process onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. The resulting model, PolyODE, thereby ensures encoding of long-range past information in the latent process and is thus anamnesic. As depicted in Figure 1, the resulting time series embeddings are able to reconstruct the past time series with significantly better accuracy. Contributions \u2022 We propose a novel dynamics function for a neural ODE resulting in PolyODE, a model that learns a global representation of high-dimensional time series and is capable of longterm forecasting and reconstruction by design. \u2022 Methodologically, we highlight the practical challenges in learning PolyODE and show how adaptive solvers for ODEs can overcome them. Theoretically, we provide bounds characterizing the quality of reconstruction of time series when using PolyODE. \u2022 Empirically, we study the performance of our approach by assessing the ability of the learnt embeddings to reconstruct the past of the time series and by studying their utility as inputs for downstream predictive tasks. We show that our model provides better time series representations, relative to several existing Neural ODEs architectures, based on the ability of the representations to accurately make predictions on several downstream tasks based on chaotic time series and irregularly sampled data from patients in intensive care units. 2 RELATED WORK: Time series modelling in machine learning: There is vast literature on the use of machine learning for time series modelling and we highlight some of the ideas that have been explored to adapt diverse kinds of models for irregular time series data. Although not naturally well suited to learning representations of such data, there have been modifications proposed to discrete-time models such as recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014) to handle such data. Models such as mTANs (Shukla and Marlin, 2021) leverage an attention-based approach to interpolate sequences to create discrete-time data from irregularly sampled data). Another strategy has been architectural modifications to the recurrence equations e.g. CT-GRU (Mozer et al., 2017), GRU-D (Che et al., 2018) and Unitary RNNs (Arjovsky et al., 2016). Much more closely aligned to our work, and a natural fit for irregularly sampled data is research that uses differential equations to model continuous-time processes(Chen et al., 2018). By parameterizing the derivative of a time series using neural networks and integrating the dynamics over unobserved time points, this class of models is well suited to handle irregularly sampled data. This includes models such as ODERNN (Rubanova et al., 2019), ODE-LSTM (Lechner and Hasani, 2020) and Neural CDE (Kidger et al., 2020). ODE-based approaches require the use of differential equation solvers during training and inference, which can come at the cost of runtime (Shukla and Marlin, 2021). PolyODEs lie in this family of models; specifically, this work proposes a new parameterization of the dynamics function and a practical method for learning that enables this model family to accurately forecast the future and reconstruct the past greatly enhancing the scope and utility of the learned embeddings. Orthogonal polynomials: PolyODEs are inspired by a rich line of work in orthogonal decomposition of time series data. Orthogonal polynomials have been a mainstay in the toolkit for engineering (Heuberger et al., 2003) and uncertainty quantification (Li et al., 2011). In the context of machine learning, the limitations of RNNs to retain long-term memory have been studied empirically and theoretically (Zhao et al., 2020). Indeed, the GRU (Chung et al., 2014) and LSTM (Graves et al., 2007) architectures were created in part to improve the long-term memory of such models. Recent approaches for discrete-time models have used orthogonal polynomials and their ability to represent temporal processes in a memory-efficient manner. The Legendre Memory Unit (Voelker et al., 2019) can be seen as a projection of data onto Legendre polynomials within the recurrence equation of RNNs. The HiPPo framework and its S4 extension (Gu et al., 2020; 2021) present an overarching generalization of this and related (Zhang et al., 2018) ideas to Legendre, Laguerre or Chebyshev polynomials. LMUs, HiPPO and S4 all rely on a linear interpolation in between observations and perform the projection on the hidden space of the model. This prevents this approach from producing accurate time series reconstruction in general and informative embedding for sparsely observed time series. Despite attempts to improve the computational performance of learning from long-term sequences (Morrill et al., 2021), we are not aware of approaches that leverage orthogonal polynomials to improve long-term memory for continuous time models. 3 BACKGROUND: Orthogonal Polynomial Projections: Orthogonal polynomials are defined with respect to a measure \u00b5 as a sequence of polynomials {P0(s), P1(s), ...} such that deg(Pi) = i and hPn, Pmi = Z Pn(s)Pm(s)d\u00b5(s) = n=m\u21b5n. (1) For simplicity, we consider only absolutely continuous measures with respect to the Lebesgue measure, such that there exists a weight function !(\u00b7) such that d\u00b5(s) = !(s)ds. The measure \u00b5 determines the class of polynomials obtained from the conditions above (Eq. 1). Examples include Legendre, Hermite or Laguerre classes of orthogonal polynomials. The measure \u00b5 also defines an inner product h\u00b7, \u00b7i\u00b5 such that the orthogonal projection of a 1-dimensional continuous process f(\u00b7) : R! R on the space of polynomials of degree N , PN is given as fN (t) = NX n=0 cnPn(t) 1 \u21b5n with cn = hf, Pni\u00b5 = Z f(s)Pn(s)d\u00b5(s). (2) This projection minimizes the distance kf pk\u00b5 for all p 2 PN and is thus optimal with respect to the measure \u00b5. One can thus encode a process f by storing its projection coefficients {c0, ..., cN}. We write the vector of coefficients up to degree N as c (the degree N is omitted) and ci = ci. Intuitively, the measure assigns different weights at times of the process and thus allows for modulating the importance of different parts of the input signal for the reconstruction. Continuous update of approximation coefficients: The projection of a process f onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials provides an optimal representation for reconstruction. However, there is often a need to update this representation continuously as new observations of the process f become available. Let f<t be the temporal process observed up until time t. We wish to compute the coefficients of this process at different times t. We can define for this purpose a time-varying measure \u00b5t and corresponding weight function !t that can incorporate our requirements in terms of reconstruction abilities over time. For instance, if one cares about reconstruction of a process temporal units in the past, one could use a time-varying weight function !t(s) = I[s 2 (t , t)] and corresponding measure. This time-varying measure induces a time-varying basis of orthogonal polynomials P tn for n = 0, ..., N . We can define the time-varying orthogonal projection and its coefficients cn(t) as f<t \u21e1 f<t,N = NX n=0 cn(t)P t n 1 \u21b5tn with cn(t) = hf<t, P tni\u00b5t = Z f<t(s)P t n(s)d\u00b5 t(s). (3) Dynamics of the projection coefficients: Computing the coefficients of the projection at each time step would be both computationally wasteful and would require storing the whole time series in memory, going against the principle of sequential updates to the model. Instead, we can leverage the fact that the coefficients evolve according to known linear dynamics over time. Remarkably, for a wide range of time-varying measures \u00b5t, Gu et al. (2020) show that the coefficients cN (t) follow: dcn(t) dt = d dt Z f<t(s)P t n(s)d\u00b5 t(s), 8n 2 N dc(t) dt = A\u00b5c(t) +B\u00b5f(t) (4) where A and B are fixed matrices (for completeness, we provide a derivation of the relation in Appendix A). Using the dynamics of Eq. 4, it is possible to update the coefficients of the projection sequentially by only using the new incoming sample f(t), while retaining the desired reconstruction abilities. Gu et al. (2020) use a discretization of the above dynamics to model discrete timesequential data via a recurrent neural network architecture. Specifically, their architecture projects the hidden representation of an RNN onto a single time series that is projected onto an polynomial basis. Our approach differs in two ways. First, we work with a continuous time model. Second, we jointly model the evolution of d-dimensional time-varying process as a overparameterized hidden representation that uses orthogonal projections to serve as memory banks. The resulting model is a new Neural ODE architecture as we detail below. 4 METHODOLOGY: Problem Setup. We consider a collection of sequences of temporal observations x = {(xi,mi, ti) : i 2 {1, ..., T}} that consist of a set of time-stamped observations and masks (xi 2 Rd,mi 2 Rd, ti 2 R). We write xi,j and mi,j for the value of the jth dimension of xi and mi respectively. The mask mi encodes the presence of each dimension at a specific time point. We set mi,j = 1 if xi,j is observed and mi,j = 0 otherwise. The number of observations for each sequence x, T , can vary across sequences. We define the set of sequences as S and the distance between two time series observed at the same times as d(x,x0) = 1T PT i kxi x0ik2. Our goal is to be able to embed a sequence x into a vector h 2 Rdh such that (1) h retains a maximal amount of information contained in x and (2) h is informative for downstream prediction tasks. We formalize both objectives below. Definition (Reverse reconstruction). Given an embedding ht of a time series x at time t, we define the reverse reconstruction x\u0302<t as the predicted values of the time series at times prior to t. We write the observed time series prior to t as x<t. Objective 1 (Long memory representation). Let ht and h0t be two embeddings of the same time series x. Let x\u0302<t and x\u03020<t be their reverse reconstruction. We say that ht enjoys more memory than h0t if d(x\u0302<t,x<t) < d(x\u03020<t,x<t). Objective 2 (Downstream task performance). Let y 2 Rdy be an auxiliary vector drawn from a unknown distribution depending on x. Let y\u0302(x) and y\u0302(x)0 be the predictions obtained from embeddings ht and h0t. For a performance metric \u21b5 : S \u21e5 Rdy ! R, we say that ht is more informative than h0t if Ex,y[\u21b5(y\u0302(x),y)] > Ex,y[\u21b5(y\u0302(x)0,y)]. 4.1 POLYODE: ANAMNESIC NEURAL ODES: We make the assumption that the observed time series x comes from an unknown but continuous temporal process x(t). Given h(t) 2 Rdh and a read-out function g : Rdh ! Rd we posit the following generative process for the data: x(t) = g(h(t)), dh(t) dt = (h(t)) (5) where part of (\u00b7) is parametrized via a neural network \u2713(\u00b7). The augmentation of the state space is a known technique to improve the expressivity of Neural ODEs (Dupont et al., 2019). Here, to ensure that the hidden representation in our model has the capacity to retain long-term memory, we augment the state space of our model by including the dynamics of coefficients of orthogonal polynomials as described in Equation 4. We structure the hidden state as h(t) = [h0(t),h1(t), . . . ,hd(t)] where h0(t) 2 Rd has the same dimension as the input process x, hi(t) 2 RN , 8i 2 1, . . . , d, has the same dimension as the vector of projection coefficients ci(t) and [\u00b7, \u00b7] is the concatenation operator. We define the readout function gi(\u00b7) : R(N+1)d ! R such that gi(h(t)) = h0(t)i. That is, gi is fixed and returns the ith value of the input vector. This leads to the following system of ODEs that characterize the evolution of h(t): Integration Step. 8 >>>>< >>>>: dc1(t) dt = A\u00b5c 1(t) +B\u00b5g1(h(t)) ... dcd(t) dt = A\u00b5c d(t) +B\u00b5gd(h(t)) dh(t) dt = \u2713(h(t)) (6) This parametrization allows learning arbitrarily complex dynamics for the temporal process x. We define a sub-system of equations of projection coefficients update for each dimension of the input temporal process x(t) 2 Rd. This sub-system is equivalent to Equation 4, where we have substituted the input process by the prediction from the hidden process h(t) through a mapping gi(\u00b7). The hidden process h0(t) acts similarly as in Neural ODEs and the processes c(t) captures long-range information about the observed time series. At each time step, we can provide an estimate of the time series x\u0302(t) conditioned on the hidden process h(t), with x\u0302(t) = g(h(t)). The system of equations in Eq. 6 characterises the dynamics in between observations. To easily update the state of the system when a new observation becomes available, This construction allows for the processing of new observations as follows. Update Step. At time t = ti, after observing xi and mask mi, we set \u21e2 hj(ti) := cj(ti), 8j s.t. mi,j = 1 h0(ti)j := xi,j , 8j s.t. mi,j = 1 (7) Remarks: Our model blends orthogonal polynomials with the flexibility offered in modelling the observations with NeuralODEs. The consequence of this is that while the coefficients serve as memory banks for each dimension of the time series, the Neural ODE over h0(t) can be used to forecast from the model. That said, we acknowledge that a significant limitation of our current design is the need for the hidden dimension to track N coefficients for each time-series dimension. Given that many adjacent time series might be correlated, we anticipate that methods to reduce the space footprint of the coefficients within our model is fertile ground for future work. 4.2 TRAINING: We train this architecture by minimizing the reconstruction error between the predictions and the observations: L = PT i=1kx\u0302(ti) xik22. We first initialize the hidden processes c(0) = 0 and h(0) = 0 though they can be initialized with static information b, if available (e.g. h(0) = \u2713(b)). We subsequently alternate between integration steps between observations and update steps at observation times. The loss is updated at each observation time ti. A pseudo-code description of the overall procedure is given in Algorithm 1. Numerical integration. We integrate the system of differential equations of Equation 6 using differentiable numerical solvers as introduced in Chen et al. (2018). However, one of the technical challenges that arise with learning PolyODE is that the dynamical system in Equation 6 is relatively stiff and integrating this process with acceptable precision would lead to prohibitive computation times with explicit solvers. This arises because a subset of this dynamical system is linear inhomogeneous and can be expressed in the following form: dx(t)dt = A\u00b5x(t) + f(t). Crucially, the real part of all eigenvalues of A are negative and the stiffness ratio, defined as the ratio between the largest and lowest real parts of the eigenvalues of A grows large with the degree of the polynomial approximation N . This is characteristic of stiff systems that will exhibit instabilities at large integration step sizes. To deal with this instability we used an implicit solver such as Backward Euler or Adams-Moulton for the numerical integration Sauer (2011). Algorithm 1: PolyODE Training Data: x, matrices A\u00b5, B\u00b5, number of dimensions d, number of observations T , number of polynomial coefficients N Result: Training loss L over a whole sequence x t\u21e4 0 Initialize hj(0) = cj(0) = 0N , 8j 2 1, ..., d, Loss L = 0 for i 1 to T do Integrate c1,...,d(t) and h0,..,d(t) from t = t\u21e4 until t = ti x\u0302i h0(t\u21e4) Update c1,...,d(ti) and h0,...,d(ti) with xi,mi. L = L+ k(x\u0302i xi) mik22 t\u21e4 ti end Forecasting: From time t, we forecast the time series at an arbitrary time t\u21e4 as: x\u0302>t(t \u21e4) = g(h(t) + Z t\u21e4 t \u2713(h(s))ds), (8) where \u2713(\u00b7) is the learned model that we use in the integration step and introduced in Eq. 5. Reverse Reconstruction: Using Equation 3, we can compute the reverse reconstruction of the time series at any time t using the projection coefficients part of the hidden process: x\u0302<t,j = NX n=0 cjn(t) \u00b7 P tn \u00b7 1 \u21b5tn . (9) The error between the prediction obtained during the integration step, x\u0302(t), and the above reconstruction estimator is bounded above, as Result 4.1 shows. The result addresses how well we should expect to perform reverse reconstructions after integrating forward in time over irregularly observed intervals. Result 4.1. For a shifted rectangular weighting function with width , !t(x) = 1 I[t ,t] (which generate Legendre polynomials), the mean square error between the forward (x\u0302) and reverse prediction (x\u0302<t) at each time t is bounded by: kx\u0302 x\u0302<tk2\u00b5t  C0 2L2(K + 1)2 N(2N 1) + C1 L(K + 1)SK\u21e0 \u2713 3 2 , N \u25c6 + C2S 2 K\u21e0 \u2713 3 2 , N \u25c6 , where K is the number of observations in the interval [t , t], L is the Lipschitz constant of the forward process, N is the degree of the polynomial approximation and \u21e0(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the Hurwitz zeta function. SK = PK i=1|x\u0302 xi| is the sum of absolute errors between the forward process and observations incurred at the update steps. C0, C1 and C2 are constants. Expectedly, the bound goes to 0 as the degree of the approximation increases. The lower cumulative absolute error SK also leads to a reduction of this bound. As the cumulative absolute error SK and our loss function L share the same optimum, for fixed , L, K and N , our training objective therefore implicitly enforces a minimization of the reconstruction error. This corresponds to optimizing Objective 1, where we set d(x,x0) = kx x0k2\u00b5t . Our architecture thus jointly minimizes both global reconstruction and global reconstruction error. Notably, when SK = 0, this result boils down to the well-known projection error for orthogonal polynomials projection of continuous processes (Canuto and Quarteroni, 1982). What is more, increasing the width of the weighting function (increasing ) predictably results in higher reconstruction error. However, this can be compensated by increasing the dimension of the polynomial basis accordingly. We also note a quadratic dependency on the Lipschitz constant of the temporal process, which can limit the reverse reconstruction abilities for high-frequency components. The full proof can be found in Appendix B. 5 EXPERIMENTS: We evaluate our approach on two objectives : (1) the ability of the learned embedding to encode global information about the time series, through the reverse reconstruction performance (or memorization) and (2) the ability of embedding to provide an informative input for a downstream task. We study our methods on the following datasets: Synthetic Univariate. We validate our approach using a univariate synthetic time series. We simulate 1000 realizations from this process and sample it at irregularly spaced time points using a Poisson point process with rate [ 1s ]. For each generated irregularly sampled time series x, we create a binary label y = I[x(5) > 0.5]. Further details about this dataset are to be found in Appendix F. Chaotic Attractors. Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit a large dependence of the dynamics on the initial conditions. This means that a noisy or incomplete evaluation of the state space may not contain much information about the past of the time series. We consider two widely used chaotic dynamical systems: Lorenz63 and a 5-dimensional Lorenz96. We generate 1000 irregularly sampled time series from different initial conditions. We completely remove one dimension of the time series such that the state space is never fully observed. This forces the model to remember the past trajectories to create an accurate estimate of the state space at each time t. MIMIC-IIII dataset. We use a pre-processed version of the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). This consists of the first 24 hours of follow-up for ICU patients. We use the following longitudinal variables: heart rate, mean and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cell count, temperature and creatinine. For each time series, the label y is the in-hospital mortality. Baselines: We compare our approach against two sets of baselines: Neural ODEs architecture and variants of recurrent neural networks architectures designed for long-term memory. To ensure a fair comparison, we use the same dimensionality of the hidden state for all models. Neural ODE baselines. We use a filtering implementation of Neural ODEs, GRU-ODE-Bayes (De Brouwer et al., 2019) and ODE-RNN Rubanova et al. (2019), an auto-encoder relying on a Neural ODE for both the encoder and the decoder part. Because of the additional auto-encoder loss, we expect this approach to provide more informative time-series embeddings. For theses baselines, we compute the reverse reconstruction by integrating the system of learnt ODEs backward in time. In case of ODE-RNN, we use the ODE of the decoder. Long-term memory RNN baselines. We compare against HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020), a recurrent neural network architecture that uses orthogonal polynomial projections of the hidden process. We also use a variant of this approach where we directly use the HiPPO operator on the observed time series, rather than on the hidden process. We call this variant HiPPO-obs. Long-range representation learning: For each dataset, we evaluate our method and the various baselines on different tasks. Implementation details are available in Appendix G. Downstream Classification. We train the models on the available time series. After training, we extract time series embedding from each model and use them as input to a multi-layer perceptron trained to predict the time series label y. We report the area under the operator-characteristic curve evaluated on a left-out test set with 5 repetitions. Time Series Reconstruction. Similarly as for the downstream classification, we extract the time series embeddings from models trained on the time series. We then compute the reverse reconstruction x\u0302<t and evaluate the MSE with respect to the true time series. Forecasting. We compare the ability of all models to forecast the future of the time series. We compute the embedding of the time series observed until some time tcond and predict over a horizon thorizon. We then report the MSE between the prediction and true trajectories. Results for these tasks are presented in Table 1 for Synthetic and Lorenz datasets and in Table 2 for MIMIC. We report additional results in Appendix C, with a larger array of irregular sampling rates. We observe that the reconstruction abilities of PolyODE clearly outperforms the other baselines, for all datasets under consideration. A similar trend is to be noted for the downstream classification for the synthetic and Lorenz datasets. For these datasets, accurate prediction of the label y requires a global representation of the time series, which results in better performance for our approach. For the MIMIC dataset, our approach compares favourably with the other methods for the downstream classification objective and outperforms other methods for trajectory forecasting. What is more, the reconstruction ability of PolyODE is significantly better than compared ap- proaches. To showcase this ability further, we plot in Figure 3 the reverse reconstructions of PolyODEand the true values (dotted lines) for the heart rate, mean blood pressure and oxygen saturation of a random patient over the first 24 hours in the ICU. This reconstruction is obtained by first sequentially processing the time series until t = 24 hours and subsequently using the hidden process to reconstruct the time series as in Equation 9. We observe that PolyODE can indeed capture the overall trend of the time series over the whole history. Ablation study: the importance of the auxiliary dynamical system: Is there utility to leveraging the neural network \u2713(\u00b7) to learn the dynamics of the time series? How well would various interpolation schemes for irregularly sampled observations perform in the context of reverse reconstruction and classification? In response to these questions, we first note that they do not support extrapolation and are thus incapable of forecasting the future of the time series. However, we compare the performance in terms of reverse reconstruction and classification in Table 3. We consider constant interpolation (last observation carried forward), linear interpolation and Hermite spline interpolation.Our results indicate a significant gap in performance between PolyODE and the linear and constant interpolation schemes. The Hermite spline interpolation allows us to capture most of the signal needed for the downstream classification task but results in significantly lower performance in terms of the reverse reconstruction error. These results therefore strongly support the importance of \u2713(\u00b7) for producing informative time series embeddings. Complementary results are available in Appendix C. Incorporating global time series uncertainty: Previous experiments demonstrate the ability of PolyODE to retain memory of the past trajectory. A similar capability can be obtained for capturing global model uncertainties over the time series history. This allows having specific uncertainty estimates at different points of the reconstruction. In Figure 4, we evaluate the association between the recovered uncertainties of PolyODE and the reverse reconstruction errors. We plot the predicted uncertainties against the root mean square error (RMSE) on a logarithmic scale. We compare our approach with using the uncertainty of the model at the last time step only. We observe that the uncertainties recovered by PolyODE are significantly more correlated with the errors (Pearson\u21e2 = 0.56) compared to using the uncertainties obtained from the last time step (Pearson-\u21e2 = 0.11). More details are available in Appendix E. 6 CONCLUSION: Producing time series representations that are easy to manipulate, representative of global dynamics, practically useful for downstream tasks and robust to irregular sampling remains an ongoing challenge. In this work, we took a step in that direction by proposing a simple but novel architecture that satisfies those requirements by de- sign. As a Neural ODE, PolyODE inherits the ability to handle irregular time series elegantly but at the same time, PolyODE also incurs computational cost associated with numerical integration. Currently, our approach also requires a large hidden space dimension and finding methods to address this that exploit the correlation between dimensions of the time series is a fruitful direction for future work.

This evaluation will delve into the technical soundness of this methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Correctness of the Equations\\n\\nThe fundamental equations underpinning Neural ODEs are mathematically sound, drawing heavily from the theory of differential equations and optimal control.\\n\\n*   **Forward Pass Equation:** The core idea is to replace a sequence of layers $h_{t+1} = h_t + f(h_t, \\\\theta_t)$ with a continuous dynamics equation:\\n    $$ \\\\frac{dh(t)}{dt} = f(h(t), t, \\\\theta) $$\\n    where $h(t)$ is the hidden state at time $t$, $f$ is a neural network parameterizing the dynamics, and $\\\\theta$ are its weights. The output of the \\\"layer\\\" is then obtained by integrating this ODE from an initial state $h(t_0)$ to a final time $t_1$:\\n    $$ h(t_1) = h(t_0) + \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} f(h(t), t, \\\\theta) dt $$\\n    This formulation is a direct application of the fundamental theorem of calculus and standard ODE theory. It accurately represents a continuous transformation.\\n\\n*   **Loss Function and Backpropagation (Adjoint Method):** This is the most crucial and technically innovative part. To train the network, we need to compute gradients of a scalar loss function $L$ with respect to the parameters $\\\\theta$. Directly backpropagating through the numerical integration steps would be memory-intensive as it would require storing all intermediate states.\\n    Neural ODEs solve this using the **adjoint sensitivity method** (also known as the Pontryagin's maximum principle in optimal control, or the reverse-mode automatic differentiation applied to ODEs).\\n    The method defines an **adjoint state** $a(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial h(t)}$ which measures how changes in $h(t)$ affect the final loss. The dynamics of this adjoint state are given by:\\n    $$ \\\\frac{da(t)}{dt} = -a(t)^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial h(t)} $$\\n    This ODE is integrated *backwards in time* from $t_1$ to $t_0$, with a terminal condition $a(t_1) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial h(t_1)}$.\\n    The gradients with respect to the parameters $\\\\theta$ are then computed by integrating another term:\\n    $$ \\\\frac{dL}{d\\\\theta} = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} a(t)^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} dt $$\\n    These equations are derived using the chain rule and calculus of variations and are mathematically sound. The key benefit is that to compute gradients, one only needs to store $h(t_0)$, $h(t_1)$, and the current values of $h(t)$ and $a(t)$ during the backward pass, avoiding the storage of all intermediate $h(t)$ values. This makes the memory cost constant with respect to the \\\"depth\\\" (integration time or effective number of layers).\\n\\n**Conclusion on Correctness:** The mathematical framework for Neural ODEs, including the forward dynamics and the adjoint-based backpropagation, is rigorously derived and widely accepted in the fields of numerical analysis and optimal control.\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of Numerical Integration Techniques\\n\\nNeural ODEs inherently rely on numerical ODE solvers. The choice of solver is critical and depends on the characteristics of the learned dynamics.\\n\\n*   **Adaptive Step-Size Solvers:** This is a crucial and appropriate choice for Neural ODEs. Unlike fixed-layer networks where the \\\"depth\\\" is fixed, the \\\"computational depth\\\" of a Neural ODE is determined by the number of steps an ODE solver takes. Adaptive solvers (e.g., Dormand-Prince (RK45), LSODA, BDF, Radau) adjust their step size to meet a specified error tolerance.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** This is highly appropriate because the underlying dynamics $f$ are learned and can be highly complex and non-uniform across the integration interval. Adaptive solvers provide a balance between accuracy and computational cost, taking larger steps when the dynamics are smooth and smaller steps when they are rapidly changing.\\n    *   **Impact:** The user-defined error tolerance directly controls the trade-off between the accuracy of the numerical solution (and thus the gradients) and the computational speed. Too high a tolerance can lead to noisy gradients and slow convergence of the training, while too low a tolerance can lead to excessive computation.\\n\\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit Solvers:**\\n    *   **Explicit Solvers (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods like RK4, Dormand-Prince):**\\n        *   **Pros:** Simple to implement, computationally cheaper per step (no matrix inversion or root finding).\\n        *   **Cons:** Limited stability regions. They can require very small step sizes to maintain stability, especially for stiff systems.\\n        *   **Appropriateness:** Suitable for \\\"non-stiff\\\" dynamics where the solution components evolve on similar timescales. Many initial applications of Neural ODEs used these.\\n    *   **Implicit Solvers (e.g., Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF), Implicit Runge-Kutta methods like Radau):**\\n        *   **Pros:** Much larger stability regions (often A-stable or L-stable), allowing for larger step sizes without sacrificing stability, even for stiff systems.\\n        *   **Cons:** Computationally more expensive per step because they require solving a system of nonlinear equations (often using Newton's method), which involves computing and inverting or factorizing Jacobian matrices.\\n        *   **Appropriateness:** Essential when the learned dynamics $f$ become stiff.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Numerical Integration:** The reliance on robust, adaptive numerical solvers is technically sound. The choice between explicit and implicit solvers is a practical one, dictated by the characteristics of the learned dynamics.\\n\\n### 3. Stability and Convergence Properties\\n\\nThis area presents some of the most significant challenges and active research fronts for Neural ODEs.\\n\\n*   **Stability of the ODE Solver:** Standard numerical solvers come with guarantees about their stability properties (e.g., A-stability, L-stability for implicit methods). These properties ensure that errors do not grow unboundedly as the integration progresses for certain classes of ODEs. Explicit solvers generally have limited stability regions.\\n*   **Convergence of the ODE Solver:** Most standard numerical solvers are convergent, meaning that as the step size approaches zero, the numerical solution converges to the true solution of the ODE. Adaptive solvers aim to maintain a user-specified error tolerance, ensuring the numerical solution remains sufficiently close to the true solution.\\n*   **Stability of the Learned Dynamical System ($f$):** This is a key concern. The neural network can learn dynamics that are intrinsically unstable (e.g., highly chaotic, rapidly diverging, or oscillating with large amplitudes). If the learned system is unstable, the integration time can become extremely long, or the solver might fail, regardless of the solver's own numerical stability. This is a property of the *model* itself, not just the numerical method.\\n    *   **Consequence:** Training can be very slow or fail to converge if the learned dynamics become pathological. Techniques like regularization, architectural constraints (e.g., making $f$ contractive), or specific initializations are sometimes used to encourage stable dynamics.\\n*   **Convergence of the Training Process (Optimization):**\\n    *   **Noisy Gradients:** The gradients computed via the adjoint method are sensitive to the accuracy of the numerical integration in both forward and backward passes. If the solver tolerances are too loose, the gradients can be noisy, making optimization difficult.\\n    *   **Complex Loss Landscape:** The integral in the forward pass makes the loss landscape potentially more complex and non-smooth than for discrete-layer networks, which can complicate optimization.\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** The iterative nature of ODE solvers means that each forward/backward pass involves many function evaluations of $f$ and its Jacobians, making training generally slower than for an equivalent-depth discrete model.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Stability and Convergence:** While numerical solvers are stable and convergent for well-behaved ODEs, the *learned dynamics* of a Neural ODE can introduce instability challenges. This, combined with the computational cost and potential for noisy gradients, makes training convergence a more complex problem than for standard deep networks.\\n\\n### 4. Handling Stiff Systems and Justification for Implicit Solvers\\n\\n*   **What is a Stiff System?** A stiff ODE system is one where numerical stability requires extremely small step sizes when using explicit methods, even though the solution itself may be smooth or slowly varying. This typically arises when the system has components evolving on vastly different time scales (e.g., some components decay very quickly, while others change slowly). The Jacobian matrix of $f$ for a stiff system will have eigenvalues with widely varying magnitudes, especially large negative real parts.\\n*   **Why Neural ODEs Can Be Stiff:** The neural network $f$ is unconstrained and can learn arbitrary dynamics. It is very common for the learned dynamics to become stiff at certain points in the state space or during different phases of training. For instance, the network might learn to approximate a system with fast transients or highly damped modes, which are hallmarks of stiffness.\\n*   **Consequences of Stiffness with Explicit Solvers:** If an explicit solver is used on a stiff system, it will either:\\n    1.  Take an astronomically large number of tiny steps to satisfy stability conditions, leading to impractically long computation times.\\n    2.  Diverge and fail if the step size is not sufficiently small.\\n*   **Justification for Using Implicit Solvers:**\\n    *   **Robustness:** Implicit solvers are designed specifically to handle stiff systems. Their large stability regions (A-stability, L-stability) allow them to take much larger steps than explicit methods while maintaining stability, even when the learned dynamics are stiff.\\n    *   **Necessity for Complex Dynamics:** For many real-world physical systems or complex data, the underlying dynamics are inherently stiff. If Neural ODEs are to model such systems effectively, implicit solvers become a necessity.\\n    *   **Reliability during Training:** During the iterative training process, the learned function $f$ will constantly change. It is very likely that $f$ will pass through phases where it behaves stiffly. An implicit solver provides much greater robustness and prevents the training from stalling or diverging due to stiffness.\\n    *   **Trade-off:** The significant advantage in stability comes at the cost of higher computational expense per step (solving a non-linear system, often requiring Jacobian computations and matrix inversions/decompositions). This means that for non-stiff problems, explicit solvers are generally faster. However, for stiff problems, implicit solvers are often the *only* practical choice.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Stiffness:** The potential for Neural ODEs to learn stiff dynamics is a significant practical challenge. The use of implicit solvers is a technically sound and often necessary choice to ensure stability, robustness, and ultimately, the feasibility of training these models on complex problems.\\n\\n### 5. Theoretical Claims and Proofs Related to Reconstruction Error Bounds\\n\\nThe foundational Neural ODE papers (e.g., Chen et al., NeurIPS 2018) primarily focused on two major theoretical contributions, rather than traditional \\\"reconstruction error bounds\\\" in the sense of numerical analysis:\\n\\n1.  **Memory Efficiency (Adjoint Method):** The core theoretical claim, backed by rigorous proof, is that the adjoint sensitivity method allows for gradient computation with memory complexity that is *constant* with respect to the integration time (or effective depth). This is a monumental claim for deep learning, as it effectively removes the memory bottleneck for arbitrarily \\\"deep\\\" continuous models. The proof relies on the derivation of the adjoint ODE and the integral for parameter gradients, which is standard in optimal control and calculus of variations. This aspect is undeniably sound.\\n\\n2.  **Universal Approximation (Implied):** While not explicitly proven as a new theorem *for Neural ODEs*, the general capability of neural networks to approximate arbitrary continuous functions (universal approximation theorems) implies that Neural ODEs can, in principle, approximate any continuous dynamical system. This relies on the properties of the neural network $f$ itself.\\n\\nRegarding \\\"Reconstruction Error Bounds\\\" in the sense of comparing the model's output to ground truth data:\\n\\n*   **Numerical Solver Error:** Standard numerical ODE solvers have well-established error bounds (e.g., local truncation error, global error which accumulates). Adaptive solvers aim to keep this numerical error below a user-specified tolerance. So, if we were given a *fixed* true ODE and a numerical solver, we could theoretically bound the difference between the numerical solution and the true solution based on the solver's order and step size.\\n*   **Overall Model Reconstruction Error:** For a Neural ODE, the \\\"reconstruction error\\\" (e.g., $\\\\|h(t_1) - y\\\\|$) is a combination of:\\n    1.  **Model Approximation Error:** How well the learned function $f(h, t, \\\\theta)$ approximates the *true* underlying dynamics of the system generating the data.\\n    2.  **Numerical Integration Error:** The error introduced by the ODE solver in computing $h(t_1)$ from $h(t_0)$.\\n    3.  **Data Noise:** Inherent noise in the observed data.\\n\\nThe foundational papers did *not* provide novel theoretical proofs for end-to-end \\\"reconstruction error bounds\\\" that link the training process and the learned dynamics to a guaranteed upper bound on the discrepancy between the model's output and the true data. This is difficult because the \\\"true\\\" underlying dynamics are unknown and being learned, and the error from the numerical solver is typically controlled by a hyperparameter (tolerance).\\n\\nSubsequent research has explored properties like Lipschitz continuity of $f$ to ensure well-posedness of the ODE and stability of solutions, which indirectly contribute to the robustness of the learned transformation. Some works also look into energy conservation or other physical invariants, which can implicitly constrain error.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Reconstruction Error Bounds:** The primary theoretical contributions of the initial Neural ODE work were related to memory efficiency and continuous modeling, not novel bounds on the overall reconstruction error specific to the Neural ODE framework beyond what standard numerical analysis provides for the solver itself. The practical \\\"reconstruction error\\\" is instead minimized via empirical optimization, with the solver's tolerance acting as a knob to control numerical precision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Technical Soundness\\n\\nNeural ODEs represent a technically sound and innovative approach to deep learning, built upon strong mathematical foundations.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Mathematical Rigor:** The core equations for the forward pass and adjoint backpropagation are correctly derived from established mathematical principles.\\n*   **Memory Efficiency:** The adjoint method is a breakthrough for deep learning, offering constant memory cost with respect to model depth.\\n*   **Continuous Modeling:** Allows for modeling phenomena that are inherently continuous in time, variable sampling rates, and interpolation between observations.\\n*   **Adaptive Computation:** Adaptive ODE solvers dynamically adjust computational effort based on complexity, providing efficient computation for a given error tolerance.\\n\\n**Challenges and Areas for Improvement/Ongoing Research:**\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Training is often significantly slower due to the iterative nature of ODE solving, especially for stiff systems requiring implicit solvers.\\n*   **Stiffness:** The propensity of learned dynamics to become stiff is a major practical hurdle, necessitating computationally expensive implicit solvers.\\n*   **Stability of Learned Dynamics:** Ensuring the learned ODE dynamics are stable and well-behaved is not guaranteed and can lead to training difficulties or pathological behavior.\\n*   **Gradient Quality:** The accuracy of gradients depends directly on solver tolerance, requiring careful tuning.\\n*   **Interpretability and Control:** While the continuous nature offers some interpretability, directly controlling the learned dynamics (e.g., ensuring specific properties like contraction or energy conservation) remains an active research area.\\n\\nIn summary, the foundational theory of Neural ODEs is robust. The practical application, however, introduces complexities related to numerical stability, computational efficiency, and the behavior of the learned dynamical system, which continue to be subjects of intensive research and development.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.3825214\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the technical soundness of the Neural ODE methodology, focusing on the correctness of the equations, the appropriateness of the numerical integration techniques used, and the stability and convergence properties of the model.

Novelty\\n\\nThe core idea of using orthogonal polynomial projection to maintain a continuous-time memory state for sequences is **highly novel**, primarily due to the introduction of **HiPPO**.\\n\\n*   **Prior Art:** Orthogonal polynomials have long been used in numerical analysis, function approximation, and signal processing (e.g., Fourier series, Chebyshev approximation). State-space models (SSMs) also have a rich history.\\n*   **The Innovation (HiPPO):** What HiPPO (and by extension, the models built upon it) introduced was the *specific formulation of a linear continuous-time dynamical system whose state variables are the coefficients of an orthogonal polynomial expansion of the input signal over a continuously evolving history*. This provided a principled way to:\\n    1.  Compress an infinitely long history into a fixed-size state (the coefficients).\\n    2.  Define a stable and efficient update rule for this state.\\n    3.  Naturally incorporate a recency bias through the underlying weighting function (e.g., Legendre polynomials with a uniform weight, or other polynomials like Laguerre with an exponential decay weight).\\n\\nWhile S4 itself is a novel *implementation* (addressing the computational challenges of general SSMs), the foundational concept of using orthogonal polynomials as a memory basis for sequence modeling was the breakthrough provided by HiPPO.\\n\\n## 2. Effectiveness\\n\\nThe effectiveness of this approach, particularly through the S4 lineage, has been demonstrated across various benchmarks:\\n\\n*   **Long-Range Arena (LRA):** S4 models achieved state-of-the-art results on tasks requiring modeling dependencies over thousands or even millions of steps (e.g., Path-X, ListOps). This is where traditional RNNs struggle with vanishing/exploding gradients and Transformers face quadratic complexity.\\n*   **Audio and Speech:** S4 models have shown strong performance in tasks like audio generation, speech denoising, and speech recognition, leveraging their ability to model long-range dependencies in continuous signals.\\n*   **Image and Video:** While less dominant than in sequential data, adaptations have shown promise in certain visual tasks by treating them as long 1D sequences.\\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** The underlying SSM allows for linear complexity in sequence length ($O(L \\\\cdot D)$ where D is state dimension) during inference and a highly parallelizable $O(L \\\\log L \\\\cdot D)$ or $O(L \\\\cdot D)$ via a parallel scan during training (via fast transforms like FFT), which is significantly better than Transformers' $O(L^2 \\\\cdot D)$ for long sequences.\\n\\n## 3. Comparison to Existing Methods (HiPPO, S4, RNNs, Transformers)\\n\\n### **Relation between HiPPO and S4:**\\n\\n*   **HiPPO:** Is the *theoretical operator* or family of operators. It defines *how* the coefficients of an orthogonal polynomial approximation of a function evolve as the function itself evolves (e.g., as new data arrives or the observation window slides). It provides the mathematical foundation for the state matrix ($A$ matrix) in an SSM. HiPPO-Legendre is a specific instance that forms the basis for many S4 models.\\n*   **S4:** Is a *structured state-space sequence model*. It takes the theoretical insights from HiPPO (specifically, the A matrix structure derived from HiPPO) and designs a practical, efficient, and trainable deep learning module. S4 innovates on the parameterization and discretization of SSMs to make them competitive with modern deep learning architectures. It leverages the HiPPO A matrix due to its inherent ability to capture long-range dependencies and its stability.\\n\\n### **Comparison to RNNs (LSTMs, GRUs):**\\n\\n*   **Advantages of Polynomial Projection (HiPPO/S4):**\\n    *   **Longer Memory:** RNNs suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients, making it hard to retain information beyond a few hundred steps. HiPPO-derived SSMs maintain a fixed-size state that *globally* approximates the past, making them robust to extremely long dependencies.\\n    *   **Theoretical Foundation:** Rooted in continuous-time systems and function approximation, offering more interpretability of how memory is stored. RNNs are more ad-hoc in their memory mechanisms.\\n    *   **Parallelization:** S4-like models can be parallelized during training (via convolution or parallel scan), unlike traditional RNNs which are inherently sequential.\\n*   **Disadvantages:**\\n    *   RNNs can be more flexible for very short-term, highly complex non-linear patterns within a small window.\\n\\n### **Comparison to Transformers:**\\n\\n*   **Advantages of Polynomial Projection (HiPPO/S4):**\\n    *   **Computational Complexity:** Linear ($O(L)$) vs. quadratic ($O(L^2)$) in sequence length, making them significantly more efficient for very long sequences (L > ~2000).\\n    *   **Memory Footprint:** Linear memory scaling with L, vs. quadratic for Transformers' attention matrices.\\n    *   **Extrapolation:** SSMs, especially with HiPPO, have a stronger inductive bias for continuous signals, potentially allowing for better extrapolation beyond the training sequence length.\\n    *   **Recency Bias:** Naturally encodes a recency bias, which can be beneficial for many time series tasks.\\n*   **Disadvantages:**\\n    *   **Global Context:** Transformers' self-attention mechanism can directly attend to *any* position in the past, offering a highly flexible global context. Polynomial projection captures a *compressed summary* which might lose specific fine-grained relationships if they don't contribute significantly to the polynomial approximation.\\n    *   **Parallelism on Short Sequences:** Transformers can be faster for shorter sequences due to highly optimized matrix multiplications.\\n    *   **Modality-Agnosticism:** Transformers are highly general, performing well across text, image, and audio without strong inductive biases. SSMs have a stronger bias towards sequential, continuous data.\\n    *   **Cross-Attention:** SSMs in their basic form don't naturally support cross-attention, which is crucial for many encoder-decoder setups.\\n\\n## 4. Theoretical Justification for Orthogonal Polynomials and Long-Range Dependencies\\n\\nThe theoretical justification lies in their properties for **function approximation** and the **HiPPO operator**:\\n\\n*   **Function Approximation:** Any sufficiently \\\"well-behaved\\\" continuous function (like a time series segment) on a compact interval can be approximated arbitrarily well by a polynomial (Weierstrass Approximation Theorem). Orthogonal polynomials form a stable and efficient basis for this approximation.\\n    *   **Benefits of Orthogonality:** Coefficients are unique, easy to compute (via inner products), and their independence ensures numerical stability.\\n*   **The HiPPO Operator:** This is the crucial theoretical component. It describes a continuous-time linear operator that projects a function onto an orthogonal polynomial basis and updates its coefficients as new information arrives or the function evolves. Specifically, HiPPO constructs the state matrix (the A matrix in an SSM) such that:\\n    1.  The state variables are the coefficients of the best polynomial approximation of the past input.\\n    2.  The update rule for these coefficients is a linear ODE.\\n    3.  For specific choices of orthogonal polynomials and weighting functions (e.g., Legendre polynomials with a uniform weight, or Laguerre polynomials with an exponential decay weight), the resulting A matrix has eigenvalues that are carefully placed (often near the imaginary axis for Legendre) to allow information to persist for extremely long durations without decaying to zero or exploding.\\n*   **Capturing Long-Range Dependencies:**\\n    *   **Compressed Memory:** Instead of explicitly storing all past values, the model stores a fixed number of polynomial coefficients that *summarize* the entire history. This compression is lossless for polynomial functions and provides a good approximation for others.\\n    *   **Stable Evolution:** The continuous-time linear dynamics ensure that information embedded in these coefficients doesn't vanish or explode over long time horizons. The eigenvalues of the A matrix dictate the memory decay rates; HiPPO specifically designs these matrices to have \\\"long-memory\\\" eigenvalues.\\n    *   **Recency Bias:** The choice of orthogonal basis and the underlying weighting function (inherent to the HiPPO derivation) naturally prioritizes more recent information while still preserving a compressed representation of the distant past. For example, the HiPPO-Legendre matrix implicitly performs a form of continuous weighted least-squares approximation that gives more importance to recent data when fitting the polynomial over the sliding window.\\n\\n## 5. Critical Evaluation of Claims Regarding Memory Retention Capabilities\\n\\n**Claims:** The model, especially S4 variants, claims superior long-range memory, handling dependencies over millions of steps, and outperforming RNNs and Transformers on specific long-sequence tasks.\\n\\n**Critical Evaluation:**\\n\\n*   **Empirical Validation:** These claims are **largely substantiated by empirical evidence**. S4 models have indeed set new benchmarks on the Long Range Arena and other challenging sequence modeling tasks where long-term memory is paramount. The ability to model dependencies over sequence lengths of $10^5$ to $10^6$ is a significant breakthrough.\\n*   **Nature of Memory:** It's important to understand the *nature* of this memory. It's not \\\"perfect recall\\\" of every single past data point. Instead, it's a **compressed, continuous, and summary-based memory**. The fixed-size state (polynomial coefficients) means that detailed information about individual past points is inevitably lost, but the *overall shape, trends, and statistically significant features* of the past signal, as captured by its polynomial approximation, are retained.\\n*   **Inductive Bias:** The \\\"memory\\\" is inherently tied to the inductive bias of polynomials. If the underlying long-range dependencies in the data are *not well-approximated by polynomials*, or if they require very high-order polynomials, then the memory might become less effective or require a very high state dimension (which increases computational cost). For instance, highly sparse, discrete events far apart might be better captured by attention (direct look-up) than by a continuous polynomial approximation.\\n*   **The Role of Eigenvalues:** The exceptional memory retention comes from the carefully structured eigenvalues of the HiPPO-derived A matrix. These eigenvalues are typically placed near the imaginary axis, allowing information to oscillate or decay very slowly, thus preserving information for a very long time. This is a deliberate design choice of the HiPPO operator, not just an emergent property.\\n*   **Practical Limitations:** While theoretically capable of infinite memory (in a continuous sense), in practice, the fixed state dimension means there's a limit to the *granularity* of information that can be retained. The memory capacity is directly tied to the polynomial order (state dimension). Higher order means more detailed memory but also higher computational cost.\\n\\nIn conclusion, orthogonal polynomial projection, primarily through the HiPPO framework, provides a novel, theoretically grounded, and empirically effective method for long-term memory in time series modeling. Its advantages in computational efficiency and true long-range dependency capture make it a strong alternative or complement to existing models, particularly for very long sequences where Transformers and RNNs falter. Its memory capabilities are real and significant, though they rely on a compressed, polynomial-based approximation of the past.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.38152165\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the novelty and effectiveness of the orthogonal polynomial projection for long-term memory in time series modeling.

Are the baselines appropriate for the task and also capable of handling irregular data (if applicable)?\\n    *   **Magnitude of Improvement:** Is the performance gain substantial enough to be meaningful in a practical context? A marginal improvement might not justify increased complexity or computational cost.\\n    *   **Statistical Significance:** Are statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) performed to confirm that performance differences are not due to random chance? Are confidence intervals reported?\\n    *   **Robustness to Hyperparameters:** Does the method show stable performance across a range of hyperparameters, or is it highly sensitive?\\n\\n*   **Qualitative Results:**\\n    *   **Visualizations:** Are there clear visualizations that demonstrate the method's capabilities (e.g., accurate predictions aligning with ground truth, realistic imputations, well-reconstructed signals)?\\n    *   **Error Analysis:** Does the paper provide insights into *when* and *why* the method performs well or poorly? This helps understand its limitations and guide future improvements.\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   Are controlled experiments performed to demonstrate the contribution of each novel component of the proposed method?

Ability to Handle Irregularly Sampled Data\\n\\nThis is a critical aspect for many real-world time series and sequential data problems.\\n\\n*   **Explicit Mechanism:** Does the proposed method have an inherent design that accommodates irregular sampling (e.g., continuous-time models, ODE-based neural networks, attention mechanisms that incorporate time differences, explicit time embeddings, point processes)? Or does it rely on pre-processing steps like interpolation or resampling, which can introduce artifacts or lose information?\\n*   **Robustness to Degree of Irregularity:** Does the method perform well across various degrees of irregularity, from slightly non-uniform to highly sparse and irregularly spaced observations?\\n*   **Comparison with Interpolation-based Methods:** A strong evaluation would compare the proposed method against traditional methods that require regularized inputs (e.g., standard RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers applied after interpolation). This clearly highlights the advantage of explicit irregular data handling.\\n*   **Information Preservation:** Does the method effectively utilize the *actual timestamps* and the *intervals between observations*, or does it treat irregular data simply as \\\"missing\\\" data points in a regular grid? The former is generally superior for preserving temporal dynamics.\\n\\n#### 6. Computational Cost and Scalability\\n\\n*   **Training Time:**\\n    *   How does the training time scale with the number of samples, sequence length, dimensionality of features, and model complexity?\\n    *   Is it feasible for large datasets and frequent retraining?\\n    *   Comparison to baselines: Is it significantly slower or faster?

This impacts deployment costs and accessibility.\\n*   **Scalability with Data Volume/Velocity:** Can the method handle streaming data or increasingly large historical datasets without significant performance degradation or exponential increase in resources?\\n*   **Comparison to Baselines (Cost):** Often, there's a trade-off between performance and computational cost. Does the improved performance of the proposed method justify its potentially higher cost, or does it achieve similar performance with lower cost?\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy systematically addressing each of these points with the specific details of your proposed method and experimental setup, you can construct a thorough and insightful assessment of its practical utility.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.38064295\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ApplicationEvaluator\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Assess the relevance of the chosen datasets, the significance of the experimental results, and the practical utility of the proposed method for downstream tasks.

This evaluation will delve into the technical soundness of this methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Correctness of the Equations\\n\\nThe fundamental equations underpinning Neural ODEs are mathematically sound, drawing heavily from the theory of differential equations and optimal control.\\n\\n*   **Forward Pass Equation:** The core idea is to replace a sequence of layers $h_{t+1} = h_t + f(h_t, \\\\theta_t)$ with a continuous dynamics equation:\\n    $$ \\\\frac{dh(t)}{dt} = f(h(t), t, \\\\theta) $$\\n    where $h(t)$ is the hidden state at time $t$, $f$ is a neural network parameterizing the dynamics, and $\\\\theta$ are its weights. The output of the \"layer\" is then obtained by integrating this ODE from an initial state $h(t_0)$ to a final time $t_1$:\\n    $$ h(t_1) = h(t_0) + \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} f(h(t), t, \\\\theta) dt $$\\n    This formulation is a direct application of the fundamental theorem of calculus and standard ODE theory. It accurately represents a continuous transformation.\\n\\n*   **Loss Function and Backpropagation (Adjoint Method):** This is the most crucial and technically innovative part. To train the network, we need to compute gradients of a scalar loss function $L$ with respect to the parameters $\\\\theta$. Directly backpropagating through the numerical integration steps would be memory-intensive as it would require storing all intermediate states.\\n    Neural ODEs solve this using the **adjoint sensitivity method** (also known as the Pontryagin\\'s maximum principle in optimal control, or the reverse-mode automatic differentiation applied to ODEs).\\n    The method defines an **adjoint state** $a(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial h(t)}$ which measures how changes in $h(t)$ affect the final loss. The dynamics of this adjoint state are given by:\\n    $$ \\\\frac{da(t)}{dt} = -a(t)^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial h(t)} $$\\n    This ODE is integrated *backwards in time* from $t_1$ to $t_0$, with a terminal condition $a(t_1) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial h(t_1)}$.\\n    The gradients with respect to the parameters $\\\\theta$ are then computed by integrating another term:\\n    $$ \\\\frac{dL}{d\\\\theta} = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} a(t)^T \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} dt $$\\n    These equations are derived using the chain rule and calculus of variations and are mathematically sound. The key benefit is that to compute gradients, one only needs to store $h(t_0)$, $h(t_1)$, and the current values of $h(t)$ and $a(t)$ during the backward pass, avoiding the storage of all intermediate $h(t)$ values. This makes the memory cost constant with respect to the \"depth\" (integration time or effective number of layers).\\n\\n**Conclusion on Correctness:** The mathematical framework for Neural ODEs, including the forward dynamics and the adjoint-based backpropagation, is rigorously derived and widely accepted in the fields of numerical analysis and optimal control.\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of Numerical Integration Techniques\\n\\nNeural ODEs inherently rely on numerical ODE solvers. The choice of solver is critical and depends on the characteristics of the learned dynamics.\\n\\n*   **Adaptive Step-Size Solvers:** This is a crucial and appropriate choice for Neural ODEs. Unlike fixed-layer networks where the \"depth\" is fixed, the \"computational depth\" of a Neural ODE is determined by the number of steps an ODE solver takes. Adaptive solvers (e.g., Dormand-Prince (RK45), LSODA, BDF, Radau) adjust their step size to meet a specified error tolerance.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** This is highly appropriate because the underlying dynamics $f$ are learned and can be highly complex and non-uniform across the integration interval. Adaptive solvers provide a balance between accuracy and computational cost, taking larger steps when the dynamics are smooth and smaller steps when they are rapidly changing.\\n    *   **Impact:** The user-defined error tolerance directly controls the trade-off between the accuracy of the numerical solution (and thus the gradients) and the computational speed. Too high a tolerance can lead to noisy gradients and slow convergence of the training, while too low a tolerance can lead to excessive computation.\\n\\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit Solvers:**\\n    *   **Explicit Solvers (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods like RK4, Dormand-Prince):**\\n        *   **Pros:** Simple to implement, computationally cheaper per step (no matrix inversion or root finding).\\n        *   **Cons:** Limited stability regions. They can require very small step sizes to maintain stability, especially for stiff systems.\\n        *   **Appropriateness:** Suitable for \"non-stiff\" dynamics where the solution components evolve on similar timescales. Many initial applications of Neural ODEs used these.\\n    *   **Implicit Solvers (e.g., Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF), Implicit Runge-Kutta methods like Radau):**\\n        *   **Pros:** Much larger stability regions (often A-stable or L-stable), allowing for larger step sizes without sacrificing stability, even for stiff systems.\\n        *   **Cons:** Computationally more expensive per step because they require solving a system of nonlinear equations (often using Newton\\'s method), which involves computing and inverting or factorizing Jacobian matrices.\\n        *   **Appropriateness:** Essential when the learned dynamics $f$ become stiff.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Numerical Integration:** The reliance on robust, adaptive numerical solvers is technically sound. The choice between explicit and implicit solvers is a practical one, dictated by the characteristics of the learned dynamics.\\n\\n### 3. Stability and Convergence Properties\\n\\nThis area presents some of the most significant challenges and active research fronts for Neural ODEs.\\n\\n*   **Stability of the ODE Solver:** Standard numerical solvers come with guarantees about their stability properties (e.g., A-stability, L-stability for implicit methods). These properties ensure that errors do not grow unboundedly as the integration progresses for certain classes of ODEs. Explicit solvers generally have limited stability regions.\\n*   **Convergence of the ODE Solver:** Most standard numerical solvers are convergent, meaning that as the step size approaches zero, the numerical solution converges to the true solution of the ODE. Adaptive solvers aim to maintain a user-specified error tolerance, ensuring the numerical solution remains sufficiently close to the true solution.\\n*   **Stability of the Learned Dynamical System ($f$):** This is a key concern. The neural network can learn dynamics that are intrinsically unstable (e.g., highly chaotic, rapidly diverging, or oscillating with large amplitudes). If the learned system is unstable, the integration time can become extremely long, or the solver might fail, regardless of the solver\\'s own numerical stability. This is a property of the *model* itself, not just the numerical method.\\n    *   **Consequence:** Training can be very slow or fail to converge if the learned dynamics become pathological. Techniques like regularization, architectural constraints (e.g., making $f$ contractive), or specific initializations are sometimes used to encourage stable dynamics.\\n*   **Convergence of the Training Process (Optimization):**\\n    *   **Noisy Gradients:** The gradients computed via the adjoint method are sensitive to the accuracy of the numerical integration in both forward and backward passes. If the solver tolerances are too loose, the gradients can be noisy, making optimization difficult.\\n    *   **Complex Loss Landscape:** The integral in the forward pass makes the loss landscape potentially more complex and non-smooth than for discrete-layer networks, which can complicate optimization.\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** The iterative nature of ODE solvers means that each forward/backward pass involves many function evaluations of $f$ and its Jacobians, making training generally slower than for an equivalent-depth discrete model.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Stability and Convergence:** While numerical solvers are stable and convergent for well-behaved ODEs, the *learned dynamics* of a Neural ODE can introduce instability challenges. This, combined with the computational cost and potential for noisy gradients, makes training convergence a more complex problem than for standard deep networks.\\n\\n### 4. Handling Stiff Systems and Justification for Implicit Solvers\\n\\n*   **What is a Stiff System?** A stiff ODE system is one where numerical stability requires extremely small step sizes when using explicit methods, even though the solution itself may be smooth or slowly varying. This typically arises when the system has components evolving on vastly different time scales (e.g., some components decay very quickly, while others change slowly). The Jacobian matrix of $f$ for a stiff system will have eigenvalues with widely varying magnitudes, especially large negative real parts.\\n*   **Why Neural ODEs Can Be Stiff:** The neural network $f$ is unconstrained and can learn arbitrary dynamics. It is very common for the learned dynamics to become stiff at certain points in the state space or during different phases of training. For instance, the network might learn to approximate a system with fast transients or highly damped modes, which are hallmarks of stiffness.\\n*   **Consequences of Stiffness with Explicit Solvers:** If an explicit solver is used on a stiff system, it will either:\\n    1.  Take an astronomically large number of tiny steps to satisfy stability conditions, leading to impractically long computation times.\\n    2.  Diverge and fail if the step size is not sufficiently small.\\n*   **Justification for Using Implicit Solvers:**\\n    *   **Robustness:** Implicit solvers are designed specifically to handle stiff systems. Their large stability regions (A-stability, L-stability) allow them to take much larger steps than explicit methods while maintaining stability, even when the learned dynamics are stiff.\\n    *   **Necessity for Complex Dynamics:** For many real-world physical systems or complex data, the underlying dynamics are inherently stiff. If Neural ODEs are to model such systems effectively, implicit solvers become a necessity.\\n    *   **Reliability during Training:** During the iterative training process, the learned function $f$ will constantly change. It is very likely that $f$ will pass through phases where it behaves stiffly. An implicit solver provides much greater robustness and prevents the training from stalling or diverging due to stiffness.\\n    *   **Trade-off:** The significant advantage in stability comes at the cost of higher computational expense per step (solving a non-linear system, often requiring Jacobian computations and matrix inversions/decompositions). This means that for non-stiff problems, explicit solvers are generally faster. However, for stiff problems, implicit solvers are often the *only* practical choice.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Stiffness:** The potential for Neural ODEs to learn stiff dynamics is a significant practical challenge. The use of implicit solvers is a technically sound and often necessary choice to ensure stability, robustness, and ultimately, the feasibility of training these models on complex problems.\\n\\n### 5. Theoretical Claims and Proofs Related to Reconstruction Error Bounds\\n\\nThe foundational Neural ODE papers (e.g., Chen et al., NeurIPS 2018) primarily focused on two major theoretical contributions, rather than traditional \"reconstruction error bounds\" in the sense of numerical analysis:\\n\\n1.  **Memory Efficiency (Adjoint Method):** The core theoretical claim, backed by rigorous proof, is that the adjoint sensitivity method allows for gradient computation with memory complexity that is *constant* with respect to the integration time (or effective depth). This is a monumental claim for deep learning, as it effectively removes the memory bottleneck for arbitrarily \"deep\" continuous models. The proof relies on the derivation of the adjoint ODE and the integral for parameter gradients, which is standard in optimal control and calculus of variations. This aspect is undeniably sound.\\n\\n2.  **Universal Approximation (Implied):** While not explicitly proven as a new theorem *for Neural ODEs*, the general capability of neural networks to approximate arbitrary continuous functions (universal approximation theorems) implies that Neural ODEs can, in principle, approximate any continuous dynamical system. This relies on the properties of the neural network $f$ itself.\\n\\nRegarding \"Reconstruction Error Bounds\" in the sense of comparing the model\\'s output to ground truth data:\\n\\n*   **Numerical Solver Error:** Standard numerical ODE solvers have well-established error bounds (e.g., local truncation error, global error which accumulates). Adaptive solvers aim to keep this numerical error below a user-specified tolerance. So, if we were given a *fixed* true ODE and a numerical solver, we could theoretically bound the difference between the numerical solution and the true solution based on the solver\\'s order and step size.\\n*   **Overall Model Reconstruction Error:** For a Neural ODE, the \"reconstruction error\" (e.g., $\\\\|h(t_1) - y\\\\|$) is a combination of:\\n    1.  **Model Approximation Error:** How well the learned function $f(h, t, \\\\theta)$ approximates the *true* underlying dynamics of the system generating the data.\\n    2.  **Numerical Integration Error:** The error introduced by the ODE solver in computing $h(t_1)$ from $h(t_0)$.\\n    3.  **Data Noise:** Inherent noise in the observed data.\\n\\nThe foundational papers did *not* provide novel theoretical proofs for end-to-end \"reconstruction error bounds\" that link the training process and the learned dynamics to a guaranteed upper bound on the discrepancy between the model\\'s output and the true data. This is difficult because the \"true\" underlying dynamics are unknown and being learned, and the error from the numerical solver is typically controlled by a hyperparameter (tolerance).\\n\\nSubsequent research has explored properties like Lipschitz continuity of $f$ to ensure well-posedness of the ODE and stability of solutions, which indirectly contribute to the robustness of the learned transformation. Some works also look into energy conservation or other physical invariants, which can implicitly constrain error.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Reconstruction Error Bounds:** The primary theoretical contributions of the initial Neural ODE work were related to memory efficiency and continuous modeling, not novel bounds on the overall reconstruction error specific to the Neural ODE framework beyond what standard numerical analysis provides for the solver itself. The practical \"reconstruction error\" is instead minimized via empirical optimization, with the solver\\'s tolerance acting as a knob to control numerical precision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Technical Soundness\\n\\nNeural ODEs represent a technically sound and innovative approach to deep learning, built upon strong mathematical foundations.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Mathematical Rigor:** The core equations for the forward pass and adjoint backpropagation are correctly derived from established mathematical principles.\\n*   **Memory Efficiency:** The adjoint method is a breakthrough for deep learning, offering constant memory cost with respect to model depth.\\n*   **Continuous Modeling:** Allows for modeling phenomena that are inherently continuous in time, variable sampling rates, and interpolation between observations.\\n*   **Adaptive Computation:** Adaptive ODE solvers dynamically adjust computational effort based on complexity, providing efficient computation for a given error tolerance.\\n\\n**Challenges and Areas for Improvement/Ongoing Research:**\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Training is often significantly slower due to the iterative nature of ODE solving, especially for stiff systems requiring implicit solvers.\\n*   **Stiffness:** The propensity of learned dynamics to become stiff is a major practical hurdle, necessitating computationally expensive implicit solvers.\\n*   **Stability of Learned Dynamics:** Ensuring the learned ODE dynamics are stable and well-behaved is not guaranteed and can lead to training difficulties or pathological behavior.\\n*   **Gradient Quality:** The accuracy of gradients depends directly on solver tolerance, requiring careful tuning.\\n*   **Interpretability and Control:** While the continuous nature offers some interpretability, directly controlling the learned dynamics (e.g., ensuring specific properties like contraction or energy conservation) remains an active research area.\\n\\nIn summary, the foundational theory of Neural ODEs is robust. The practical application, however, introduces complexities related to numerical stability, computational efficiency, and the behavior of the learned dynamical system, which continue to be subjects of intensive research and development.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.3825214}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The orthogonal polynomial projection approach, particularly as embodied by HiPPO (High-Order Polynomial Projection Operators) and its practical implementation in models like S4 (Structured State Space Sequences), represents a significant advance in time series modeling, especially for long-term memory.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down its aspects:\\n\\n## 1. Novelty\\n\\nThe core idea of using orthogonal polynomial projection to maintain a continuous-time memory state for sequences is **highly novel**, primarily due to the introduction of **HiPPO**.\\n\\n*   **Prior Art:** Orthogonal polynomials have long been used in numerical analysis, function approximation, and signal processing (e.g., Fourier series, Chebyshev approximation). State-space models (SSMs) also have a rich history.\\n*   **The Innovation (HiPPO):** What HiPPO (and by extension, the models built upon it) introduced was the *specific formulation of a linear continuous-time dynamical system whose state variables are the coefficients of an orthogonal polynomial expansion of the input signal over a continuously evolving history*. This provided a principled way to:\\n    1.  Compress an infinitely long history into a fixed-size state (the coefficients).\\n    2.  Define a stable and efficient update rule for this state.\\n    3.  Naturally incorporate a recency bias through the underlying weighting function (e.g., Legendre polynomials with a uniform weight, or other polynomials like Laguerre with an exponential decay weight).\\n\\nWhile S4 itself is a novel *implementation* (addressing the computational challenges of general SSMs), the foundational concept of using orthogonal polynomials as a memory basis for sequence modeling was the breakthrough provided by HiPPO.\\n\\n## 2. Effectiveness\\n\\nThe effectiveness of this approach, particularly through the S4 lineage, has been demonstrated across various benchmarks:\\n\\n*   **Long-Range Arena (LRA):** S4 models achieved state-of-the-art results on tasks requiring modeling dependencies over thousands or even millions of steps (e.g., Path-X, ListOps). This is where traditional RNNs struggle with vanishing/exploding gradients and Transformers face quadratic complexity.\\n*   **Audio and Speech:** S4 models have shown strong performance in tasks like audio generation, speech denoising, and speech recognition, leveraging their ability to model long-range dependencies in continuous signals.\\n*   **Image and Video:** While less dominant than in sequential data, adaptations have shown promise in certain visual tasks by treating them as long 1D sequences.\\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** The underlying SSM allows for linear complexity in sequence length ($O(L \\\\cdot D)$ where D is state dimension) during inference and a highly parallelizable $O(L \\\\log L \\\\cdot D)$ or $O(L \\\\cdot D)$ via a parallel scan during training (via fast transforms like FFT), which is significantly better than Transformers\\' $O(L^2 \\\\cdot D)$ for long sequences.\\n\\n## 3. Comparison to Existing Methods (HiPPO, S4, RNNs, Transformers)\\n\\n### **Relation between HiPPO and S4:**\\n\\n*   **HiPPO:** Is the *theoretical operator* or family of operators. It defines *how* the coefficients of an orthogonal polynomial approximation of a function evolve as the function itself evolves (e.g., as new data arrives or the observation window slides). It provides the mathematical foundation for the state matrix ($A$ matrix) in an SSM. HiPPO-Legendre is a specific instance that forms the basis for many S4 models.\\n*   **S4:** Is a *structured state-space sequence model*. It takes the theoretical insights from HiPPO (specifically, the A matrix structure derived from HiPPO) and designs a practical, efficient, and trainable deep learning module. S4 innovates on the parameterization and discretization of SSMs to make them competitive with modern deep learning architectures. It leverages the HiPPO A matrix due to its inherent ability to capture long-range dependencies and its stability.\\n\\n### **Comparison to RNNs (LSTMs, GRUs):**\\n\\n*   **Advantages of Polynomial Projection (HiPPO/S4):**\\n    *   **Longer Memory:** RNNs suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients, making it hard to retain information beyond a few hundred steps. HiPPO-derived SSMs maintain a fixed-size state that *globally* approximates the past, making them robust to extremely long dependencies.\\n    *   **Theoretical Foundation:** Rooted in continuous-time systems and function approximation, offering more interpretability of how memory is stored. RNNs are more ad-hoc in their memory mechanisms.\\n    *   **Parallelization:** S4-like models can be parallelized during training (via convolution or parallel scan), unlike traditional RNNs which are inherently sequential.\\n*   **Disadvantages:**\\n    *   RNNs can be more flexible for very short-term, highly complex non-linear patterns within a small window.\\n\\n### **Comparison to Transformers:**\\n\\n*   **Advantages of Polynomial Projection (HiPPO/S4):**\\n    *   **Computational Complexity:** Linear ($O(L)$) vs. quadratic ($O(L^2)$) in sequence length, making them significantly more efficient for very long sequences (L > ~2000).\\n    *   **Memory Footprint:** Linear memory scaling with L, vs. quadratic for Transformers\\' attention matrices.\\n    *   **Extrapolation:** SSMs, especially with HiPPO, have a stronger inductive bias for continuous signals, potentially allowing for better extrapolation beyond the training sequence length.\\n    *   **Recency Bias:** Naturally encodes a recency bias, which can be beneficial for many time series tasks.\\n*   **Disadvantages:**\\n    *   **Global Context:** Transformers\\' self-attention mechanism can directly attend to *any* position in the past, offering a highly flexible global context. Polynomial projection captures a *compressed summary* which might lose specific fine-grained relationships if they don\\'t contribute significantly to the polynomial approximation.\\n    *   **Parallelism on Short Sequences:** Transformers can be faster for shorter sequences due to highly optimized matrix multiplications.\\n    *   **Modality-Agnosticism:** Transformers are highly general, performing well across text, image, and audio without strong inductive biases. SSMs have a stronger bias towards sequential, continuous data.\\n    *   **Cross-Attention:** SSMs in their basic form don\\'t naturally support cross-attention, which is crucial for many encoder-decoder setups.\\n\\n## 4. Theoretical Justification for Orthogonal Polynomials and Long-Range Dependencies\\n\\nThe theoretical justification lies in their properties for **function approximation** and the **HiPPO operator**:\\n\\n*   **Function Approximation:** Any sufficiently \"well-behaved\" continuous function (like a time series segment) on a compact interval can be approximated arbitrarily well by a polynomial (Weierstrass Approximation Theorem). Orthogonal polynomials form a stable and efficient basis for this approximation.\\n    *   **Benefits of Orthogonality:** Coefficients are unique, easy to compute (via inner products), and their independence ensures numerical stability.\\n*   **The HiPPO Operator:** This is the crucial theoretical component. It describes a continuous-time linear operator that projects a function onto an orthogonal polynomial basis and updates its coefficients as new information arrives or the function evolves. Specifically, HiPPO constructs the state matrix (the A matrix in an SSM) such that:\\n    1.  The state variables are the coefficients of the best polynomial approximation of the past input.\\n    2.  The update rule for these coefficients is a linear ODE.\\n    3.  For specific choices of orthogonal polynomials and weighting functions (e.g., Legendre polynomials with a uniform weight, or Laguerre polynomials with an exponential decay weight), the resulting A matrix has eigenvalues that are carefully placed (often near the imaginary axis for Legendre) to allow information to persist for extremely long durations without decaying to zero or exploding.\\n*   **Capturing Long-Range Dependencies:**\\n    *   **Compressed Memory:** Instead of explicitly storing all past values, the model stores a fixed number of polynomial coefficients that *summarize* the entire history. This compression is lossless for polynomial functions and provides a good approximation for others.\\n    *   **Stable Evolution:** The continuous-time linear dynamics ensure that information embedded in these coefficients doesn\\'t vanish or explode over long time horizons. The eigenvalues of the A matrix dictate the memory decay rates; HiPPO specifically designs these matrices to have \"long-memory\" eigenvalues.\\n    *   **Recency Bias:** The choice of orthogonal basis and the underlying weighting function (inherent to the HiPPO derivation) naturally prioritizes more recent information while still preserving a compressed representation of the distant past. For example, the HiPPO-Legendre matrix implicitly performs a form of continuous weighted least-squares approximation that gives more importance to recent data when fitting the polynomial over the sliding window.\\n\\n## 5. Critical Evaluation of Claims Regarding Memory Retention Capabilities\\n\\n**Claims:** The model, especially S4 variants, claims superior long-range memory, handling dependencies over millions of steps, and outperforming RNNs and Transformers on specific long-sequence tasks.\\n\\n**Critical Evaluation:**\\n\\n*   **Empirical Validation:** These claims are **largely substantiated by empirical evidence**. S4 models have indeed set new benchmarks on the Long Range Arena and other challenging sequence modeling tasks where long-term memory is paramount. The ability to model dependencies over sequence lengths of $10^5$ to $10^6$ is a significant breakthrough.\\n*   **Nature of Memory:** It\\'s important to understand the *nature* of this memory. It\\'s not \"perfect recall\" of every single past data point. Instead, it\\'s a **compressed, continuous, and summary-based memory**. The fixed-size state (polynomial coefficients) means that detailed information about individual past points is inevitably lost, but the *overall shape, trends, and statistically significant features* of the past signal, as captured by its polynomial approximation, are retained.\\n*   **Inductive Bias:** The \"memory\" is inherently tied to the inductive bias of polynomials. If the underlying long-range dependencies in the data are *not well-approximated by polynomials*, or if they require very high-order polynomials, then the memory might become less effective or require a very high state dimension (which increases computational cost). For instance, highly sparse, discrete events far apart might be better captured by attention (direct look-up) than by a continuous polynomial approximation.\\n*   **The Role of Eigenvalues:** The exceptional memory retention comes from the carefully structured eigenvalues of the HiPPO-derived A matrix. These eigenvalues are typically placed near the imaginary axis, allowing information to oscillate or decay very slowly, thus preserving information for a very long time. This is a deliberate design choice of the HiPPO operator, not just an emergent property.\\n*   **Practical Limitations:** While theoretically capable of infinite memory (in a continuous sense), in practice, the fixed state dimension means there\\'s a limit to the *granularity* of information that can be retained. The memory capacity is directly tied to the polynomial order (state dimension). Higher order means more detailed memory but also higher computational cost.\\n\\nIn conclusion, orthogonal polynomial projection, primarily through the HiPPO framework, provides a novel, theoretically grounded, and empirically effective method for long-term memory in time series modeling. Its advantages in computational efficiency and true long-range dependency capture make it a strong alternative or complement to existing models, particularly for very long sequences where Transformers and RNNs falter. Its memory capabilities are real and significant, though they rely on a compressed, polynomial-based approximation of the past.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.38152165}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'To provide a precise and actionable assessment, I need specific details about:\\n\\n1.  **The Proposed Method:** What kind of machine learning model is it?

Ability to Handle Irregularly Sampled Data\\n\\nThis is a critical aspect for many real-world time series and sequential data problems.\\n\\n*   **Explicit Mechanism:** Does the proposed method have an inherent design that accommodates irregular sampling (e.g., continuous-time models, ODE-based neural networks, attention mechanisms that incorporate time differences, explicit time embeddings, point processes)? Or does it rely on pre-processing steps like interpolation or resampling, which can introduce artifacts or lose information?\\n*   **Robustness to Degree of Irregularity:** Does the method perform well across various degrees of irregularity, from slightly non-uniform to highly sparse and irregularly spaced observations?\\n*   **Comparison with Interpolation-based Methods:** A strong evaluation would compare the proposed method against traditional methods that require regularized inputs (e.g., standard RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers applied after interpolation). This clearly highlights the advantage of explicit irregular data handling.\\n*   **Information Preservation:** Does the method effectively utilize the *actual timestamps* and the *intervals between observations*, or does it treat irregular data simply as \"missing\" data points in a regular grid?
