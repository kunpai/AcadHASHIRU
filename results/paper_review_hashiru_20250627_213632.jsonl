The paper title is: Synthetic Data Generation of Many-to-Many Datasets via Random Graph Generation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Private data release has gained much attention in recent years due to new regulations in privacy such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To obey such regulations and to protect privacy, a popular approach from the machine learning community called synthetic data generation (SDG) is developed in various domains (Nowok et al., 2016; Montanez et al., 2018; Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Tucker et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Ziller et al., 2021). In SDG, synthetic data that is statistically similar but not identical to real data is released as a replacement of the real data to protect. On top of it, special attention has also been paid to make sure these methods work well on tabular data as most real-world datasets are stored as tables in databases (Montanez et al., 2018; Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020). At the core of most SDG methods are generative models\u2014probabilistic models that one can drawn samples from. Usually a generative model is firstly trained to capture the distribution of the private real data, and then samples are drawn from the model so they can be released as protected synthetic data. However, this procedure without extra care does not have guarantees privacy. To tackle this, research in this direction has also been focusing on differentially private generative models (Zhang et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018; Jordon et al., 2018)\u2014generative models that satisfy a notion of privacy called differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2014), which controls the amount of information individual datum can reveal. While real-world datasets usually consist of multiple tables with potential many-to-many relationships, SDG for such type of data is not well-studied. Most of recent work focuses on modeling tables independently (Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020) or considers generating many-to-many relationships but only for special cases such as one-to-many (Getoor et al., 2007; Montanez et al., 2018). As a side effect, privacy for multi-table SDG with manyto-many relationships is also under-studied. In fact, relationships in real data can also reveal private information (Sala et al., 2011; Proserpio et al., 2012). For example, in a customer-merchant dataset, the number of links to a merchant could reveal its identity because of its uncommon popularity. This paper studies the challenge of building faithful generative models (Webb et al., 2018) to synthesize data together with their many-to-many relationships, and proposes a novel factorization for many-to-many generative models, which leads to a scalable approach by combining results from random graph theory and representation learning. In short, our paper has the following contributions: 1. We study possible factorization of faithful generative models for many-to-many data and identify limitations of those taken by existing approaches. 2. We propose a novel factorization for modeling distributions over many-to-many data and we use it to develop a synthetic data generation framework using methods from random graph generation, node representation learning and set representation learning. 3. We extend the proposed framework to establish the notion of (\u03f5, \u03b4)-differential privacy. 4. We evaluate two model instances from our framework, BayesM2M and NeuralM2M, on the MOVIELENS dataset, demonstrating its superior performance over its closest competitor, SDV, especially on capturing information in many-to-many relationships. 2 BACKGROUND AND NOTATIONS: Bipartite and multipartite graphs A bipartite graph B := (U,V,L) is a tuple of two disjoint node sets U,V (called upper and lower nodes respectively) as well as a set of edges L between them. Each node is represented by a tuple of its index and attribute, e.g. nku := (i k u, x k u) \u2208 U for k = 1, . . . , |U|. Each edge is represented by a tuple of node indices, i.e. lk := (iku, i k v) \u2208 L for k = 1, . . . , |L|. Such edge sets can be represented as adjacency matrices G or biadjacency matrices B; see figure 1b for an illustration. A generalised notion of bipartite graphs called multipartite graphs, denoted as M := ({Tk1}Nk1=1, {L k2}Mk2=1), are graphs with N disjoint node sets and M \u2264 ( N 2 ) edge sets. Modeling datasets with many-to-many relationships 1Datasets with many-to-many relationships, such as relational databases, can be viewed as multipartite graphs. Denote the generating distribution of a given multipartite graph Mdata as pdata(M). The goal of this paper is to build a generative model p\u03b8(M) with learnable parameter \u03b8 and to develop a learning algorithm A1 that takesMdata as inputs and outputs the optimal model p\u03b8\u2217 with parameter \u03b8\u2217, s.t. p\u03b8\u2217(M) is close to pdata(M). After learning, a sample M\u0303 is drawn from the model and used as synthetic data; we denote this sampling process/algorithm as A2. Differential privacy In this work, we are interested in establishing the standard (\u03f5, \u03b4)-differential privacy, a.k.a. (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP or approximate DP. Denote A = A2 \u25e6 A1. We say a model p\u03b8 with A is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP according to the following definition (Dwork et al., 2014): Definition 1 ((\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP for p\u03b8 with A). A generative model p\u03b8 with the synthesis algorithm A is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP if for all S \u2286 Range(A) and for all B,B\u2032 that differ on a single element: P(A(B) \u2208 S) \u2264 exp(\u03f5)P(A(B\u2032) \u2208 S) + \u03b4. In our case, S is the output of the synthesis algorithm A\u2019s training procedure, while we are interested in the most general case (with strongest privacy protection) and define an element as a single node that could be part of either U or V. If \u03b4 = 0, we also call a model p\u03b8 with A satisfies \u03f5-differential privacy, i.e. \u03f5-DP. 1Note here we are intended to avoid using terms such as primary/foreign keys and parents/children from the relational database literature. This is because in order to model the joint distribution for a given dataset, parentchild directions can be rearranged for modeling convenience in favor of some particular factorization of the joint. Learning graph distributions Consider the distribution pdata(L) for a given set of edges Ldata. Unlike setup in work like Liao et al. (2019) in which multiple samples from pdata are given, we are presented with a single sample from pdata. Therefore, rather than replying on the standard notion of learning as probability divergence minimization using empirical samples, we consider learning a model p\u03b8(L) such that samples from it share similar graph properties as Ldata. Graph properties We consider the dK-distributions from Mahadevan et al. (2006) with d = 2, defined as the (joint) degree distribution of all pairs of d nodes in the graph.2 We call all graphs with a given dK-distributions dK-graphs. For example, 0K-graphs share the same graph density, 1K-graphs share the same distribution of node degrees, 2K-graphs share the same joint distributions of degrees of node pairs, etc. We call models that sample dK-graphs dK-generators. We consider the same notion for bipartite graphs, defining bipartite dK-graphs, and consider learning p\u03b8 that generates bipartite 2K-graphs of data. For a bipartite graph B, we denote its bipartite joint degree distribution (BJDD) as the empirical distribution of samples {(deg(n(iku)),deg(n(ikv)))} |L| k=1, where n(i) denotes the node with index i (similarly i(n) is the node index for node n) and deg(n) is the degree of the node n. Such empirical distribution can be represented as a matrix PJ along with the supports du,dv for both dimensions; see figure 1c for an illustration. One can also compute the (marginal) degree distributions of the upper or lower nodes from BJDD. For example, that of upper nodes pu is a probability vector (a vector of whose elements sum up to 1) in which its i-th element pu[i] = \u2211 j PJ[i, j]/du[i]. 3 RELATED WORK: Generative models for tabular data In general, there are two categories of generative models that have been successfully applied to tabular data. One is based on classic graphical models. This includes directed graphical models such as Bayesian networks PrivBayes (PrivBayes; Zhang et al., 2017) and auto-regressive models (synthpop; Nowok et al., 2016) as well as undirected graphical models such as factor graphs (MST; McKenna et al., 2019). For these models, data is usually discretized in order to facilitate efficient learning. Another is based on recently emerged deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs; Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs; Goodfellow et al., 2014). Unlike graphical models, work on deep generative models has been mostly focusing on developing methods to directly model heterogeneous data, which are mixed-type data with different types of continuous (real, positive real, etc) and discrete variables (categorical, ordinal, etc), which includes specific pre-processing steps, neural network architecture design, improving training, etc (Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020); for surveys, see Fan et al. (2020); Borisov et al. (2021). Generative models for relational data Probabilistic relational models (PRMs) (Friedman et al., 1999; Getoor et al., 2007) is the most well-established approach to building distributions over relational data. Getoor et al. (2007) describes two ways of dealing with structural uncertainty but only with learning methods for structures, i.e. finding the best structures. While it is possible to extend these methods to samplers by using Markov chain Monte Carlo for sampling, applying them to datasets at scale would be challenging. Mostly related to our work is Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) (Patki et al., 2016; Montanez et al., 2018), which is based on PRMs and considers the task of synthesizing relational data with links. However, SDV only models one-to-many relationships by recording the children count per row and generates one-to-many links by sampling the number of children. Because SDV cannot handle many-to-one relationships, the so-called \u201cmultiple parents\u201d problem occurs in certain scenarios (Montanez et al., 2018). For example, consider three tables A\u2212B \u2212 C forming an one-many-one relationship. At generation time, SDV has to generate A and C first and conditionally generates B given A and C, at which stage it is unclear whether the children counts in A or C should be used. Montanez et al. (2018) suggests to either randomly pick a table for the conditional generation or to perform weighted averaging between parents. Another related work based on PRMs is Ben Ishak et al. (2016), which describes a generator for many-to-many data 2With d increasing, samples from the dK-distributions become more similar to the data but generating dKgraphs is increasingly computationally complex; luckily 2K-graphs are sufficient for most practical purposes (Mahadevan et al., 2006). Also note that with d \u2192 \u221e, dK-series describe any given graph completely. In addition, from a privacy perspective, a large d means high sensitivity in the dK-series, which requires much more noise to be added for achieving \u03f5-DP for a given \u03f5 (Sala et al., 2011). with links. However, the work only targets generating testing data\u2014data used as test examples in a software engineering setup. Thus, the generator is learnable. Random graph generation One line of work in this direction is built on the classic degree sequence problem, which is the problem of finding some or all graphs with a given degree sequence (Molloy & Reed, 1995). Mahadevan et al. (2006) introduces the notion of dK-graphs and studies generating them via classic random graph methods, such as the pseudograph or configuration approach (Molloy & Reed, 1995; Aiello et al., 2000). As classic methods in general cannot correctly sample dK-graphs with d \u2265 2, a few follow-up works improves the sampling for these graphs (Stanton & Pinar, 2012; Gjoka et al., 2013; 2015). Unlike previous work that focuses on general graphs, Boroojeni et al. (2017) specifically considers sampling bipartite graphs that preserves the 2K-distribution. Another line of methods, unlike above-mentioned methods that can generate arbitrary-sized graphs, can only generate graphs with the same size as the data graph, e.g. spectral-based approach in Baldesi et al. (2018), or expands it by a whole number, e.g. method based on fractal expansions from Belletti et al. (2019). Differentially private SDG In terms of DP generative models, a few graphical models discussed above (PrivBayes, MST) are originally proposed in a DP context. For deep generative models, there are two generic training algorithms that make models differentially private: differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD; Abadi et al., 2016) and private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE; Papernot et al., 2016; 2018), leading to methods such as DP-GAN (Xie et al., 2018) and PATE-GAN (Jordon et al., 2018). Regarding random graph generation, Sala et al. (2011); Proserpio et al. (2012) consider the release of graphs in a differentially private manner based on dK-generators. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work specifically targeting differentially private synthesis of bipartite graphs, nor previous work for differentially private synthesis for many-to-many datasets. 4 MODELING MANY-TO-MANY DATASETS WITH DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: In this section, we first discuss the challenges of building faithful generative models (Webb et al., 2018) for many-to-many datasets by studying possible factorization of the joint distribution (section 4.1), during which we also identify the limitations of the factorization that existing approaches are based on. Based on a novel factorization, we use methods from random graph generation, node representation learning and set representation learning to develop a new type of scalable generative model for manyto-many datasets section 4.2. Finally, we extend the model to be (\u03f5, \u03b4)-differentially private section 4.3. Also note that in this section, for brevity, we omit the model parameter \u03b8 in p\u03b8 unless it is necessary. 4.1 FAITHFUL GENERATIVE MODELS FOR MANY-TO-MANY DATASETS: To simplify the discussion, we first focus on modeling bipartite graph and will later extend it to multipartite graphs. The term \u201cfaithful\u201d as in faithful generative models refers to the fact that the model does not introduce any conditional independence that is not true in general (Webb et al., 2018). For the joint distribution p(U,V,L), where U,V are two tables with rows linked by edges in L, that we are interested in, considering the fact that the roles of U and V are exchangeable, there are only three possible factorization of the joint p(U,V,L) := pjoint: FACTORIZATION S FACTORIZATION E FACTORIZATION A pjoint p(U)p(L | U)p(V | U,L) p(U)p(V | U)p(L | U,V) p(L)p(U | L)p(V | U,L) Within all factorization, there are a 6 sub-models in total to consider. \u2022 p(U) (the single-table model) can be any generative model for single table generation. \u2022 p(L | U) (the semi-conditional edge model) requires to generate edges based on one of the table\u2014the row count generation used in Montanez et al. (2018) is in fact an example of such. However, a general case of this model can be computational challenging: For any subset of U, it requires checking if they together link to an existing or new node in V. \u2022 p(V | U,L) (the conditional table model) requires to generate each node in V based on the first table and all connections. As per node in V is connected to a subset of nodes in U via L, it requires to condition on a set of varied number of nodes for modelling, which can be done using a aggregation function or a aggregator (Getoor et al., 2007; Montanez et al., 2018). another (while marginalizing all edges). This model can be computational challenge to implement. A potential work-around is to model the two-table joint p(U,V) directly by joining two tables and apply a generative model on the joined table. However, this could easily lead to table with an intractable scale. And perhaps more importantly, it is hard to undo this join operation from the synthetic data to recover individual tables in general.3. \u2022 p(L | U,V) (the edge prediction model) predicts the existences of edges between node pairs and is essential probabilistic models used in many recommender systems. \u2022 p(L) (the edge model) requires to model the edges (i.e. the graph) unconditionally\u2014this is the type of random graph models that usually studied in random graph theory. \u2022 p(U | L) (the edge-conditional table model) requires to generate one of the table given the topology of edges. One way to achieve such conditioning is by using a node embedding to condition on. This is also related to node attributes generation/prediction in graph models. As discussed, approaches from Getoor et al. (2007); Montanez et al. (2018) correspond to FACTORIZATION S and there is no easy way to extend p(L | U) to a general many-to-many case. FACTORIZATION E also has the scalability issue in p(V | U) (or similarly in p(U,V)) as discussed. Our approach will then be based on FACTORIZATION A that does not have such concerns/limitations. Considering edges attributes So far our discussion assumes there are no edge attributes, which is not true in general, e.g. ratings in MOVIELENS. The way to deal with this is by adding an extra edge attribute model that is similar to p(L | U,V) but generates edge attributes instead. One can use any edge prediction model for this purpose\u2014rather than predicting the existence of edges it generates the edge attributes\u2014and the corresponding generation step is performed after all other data is generated. Extending to multipartite graphs For a given datasets with multiple tables, we assume the links at table level are given. Thus we can impose an arbitrary order on the tables and generate the edges and tables in order; this is similar to how an arbitrary order is imposed on random variables as in Bayesian networks. Extra care needs to be taken for graph generation when generating graphs involving tables with more than one connection, which will be explained in section 4.2.1. 4.2 RANDOM GRAPH GENERATION BASED MANY-TO-MANY SYNTHESIS: We now describe how to model the three distributions in our proposed factorization pjoint = p(L)p(U | L)p(V | U,L): p(L) in section 4.2.1, p(U | L) in section 4.2.2 and p(V | L,U) in section 4.2.3. Figure 2 also provides an illustration of the learning and sampling process for the proposed method. 4.2.1 GRAPH MODELING VIA RANDOM GRAPH GENERATION: We consider using bipartite dK-generators to model p(L) that take in a target BJD J and generate random graph satisfying this J. Boroojeni et al. (2017) proves the existence of an algorithm for sampling bipartite graphs with a target BJD J, giving rise to bipartite 2K-generators. The idea is 3As a concrete example, suppose U has a single column C1 with a continuous variable, V has another column C2 (with either a continuous or discrete variable) and L indicates every row in U is linked with two rows in V. After joining two tables, we will arrive with a table in which two columns C1, C2 in which there are duplicated elements in C1 due to the one-to-many relationship; it is also possible to undo the join operation on this real dataset. However, for any generative model that treats C1 as continuous variable, the probability of having duplicated elements in C1 is exactly 0, which means any synthetic dataset would effectively giving a dataset with one-to-one relationship between U and V, after undoing the join operation. to first generate a bipartite graph based on random pairing, after which the graph matches the 2K distribution but has potentially repeated edges. Then, a rewiring process is performed to make the graph simple\u2014a graph is called simple if there is no loop or multiple edges (West et al., 2001). Boroojeni et al. (2017) shows that such rewiring process exists and can always produce a graph with the target BJD. Since the prescribed algorithm of rewiring in Boroojeni et al. (2017) contains a few mistakes/typos, we present a corrected version in algorithm 1 in appendix A. To complete the description of p\u03b8(L), we also need to define how to obtain J that bipartite algorithm 1 take in. For this, we draw samples from PJ with a prescribed number of edges. However, as this might invalidate the input to algorithm 14, which may cause infinite loops in rewiring, we stop the rewiring process after a predefined maximum number of iterations. To this end, sampling from J together with algorithm 1 define p\u03b8(L) through its generative process, where \u03b8 is the BJDD matrix PJ. \u201cBackward compatibility\u201d of the graph generator One consideration taken into account while selecting the model for p(L) was \u201cbackward compatibility\u201d to one-to-many and many-to-one problems. This refers to the cases where if the data graph contains only one-to-many relationships, the generated graphs shall do so. The 2K-generator indeed satisfies this property while, in contrast, spectral-based graph generation methods such as Baldesi et al. (2018) usually fail to hold it. Learning and sampling Learning of this model only involves computing the BJDD matrix from the data graph; if a table is involved in multiple edges, the joint distribution of all degrees per node is learned. Sampling from the model is defined by sampling from PJ followed by algorithm 1. 4.2.2 CONDITIONAL MODELING VIA NODE EMBEDDING: We now discuss how to model upper nodes U conditioned on edges L. This distribution essentially models a set of nodes given topology, which can be dealt with the use of node embedding as: p(U | L) = |U|\u220f k=1 p(niu | \u03b2(L, i)), (1) where the node encoder \u03b2 computes node embedding of node i in graph L; its range is ran(\u03b2) = RH\u03b2 , where H\u03b2 is the dimension of the node embedding. As such, once given \u03b2, this distribution can be modeled by any existing conditional generative model. A few candidates of such \u03b2 are: 1. Node statistics: d-step neighbour count (number of neighbours of distance d) can be used. As an simple example, d = 1 means using node degrees as 1d embeddings. It can be generalised to use a collection of counts with H\u03b2 different d, giving to an embedding of size H\u03b2 . 2. Node embedding: Methods to learn node embedding such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) and node2vec (Grover & Leskovec, 2016) can also be used as \u03b2. Learning and sampling Learning of this model involves learning the node embedding (if it is not fixed) and learning the conditional generative model. Sampling from the model is straightforward. 4.2.3 CONDITIONAL MODELING VIA SET EMBEDDING: Consider a node nv \u2208 V with neighbors ne(nv) \u2286 U. It is easy to see that, given ne(nv), nv is conditionally independent with any other n\u2032v \u2208 V. Thus, we have p(V | L,U) = \u220f nv\u2208V p(nv | ne(nv)), where p(nv | ne(nv)) is a conditional distribution whose condition is a multiset\u2014a set that allows repeated elements. Without imposing any order on ne(nv), one way to condition on this through a fixed-size set embedding computed by an aggregator \u03b3, which leads to our model p(V | L,U) = \u220f nv\u2208V p(nv | \u03b3(ne(nv))). (2) Equation 2 requires an aggregator \u03b3 : pow(U) 7\u2192 RH\u03b3 where pow(U) is the power set of U and H\u03b3 is the dimension of the set embedding. A few candidates of such \u03b3 are: 4Algorithm 1 assumes two conditions for the input J: (i) J[i, j] \u2264 ( \u2211 j J[i, j]/du[i])( \u2211 i J[i, j]/dv[j]) and (ii) the degree sums for upper and lower nodes are the same (which would be true as long as \u2211 j J[i, j]/du[i]) is integer for all i and \u2211 i J[i, j]/du[j] is integer for all j) (Boroojeni et al., 2017). 1. Summary statistics: count, sum, n-th order moments, q-percent quantiles, etc. can be used. If both count and sum are used and d different moments and quantiles are used, the total dimension of the embedding is D+D+ d\u00d7D+ d\u00d7D for nodes with D-dimensional attributes. 2. Distribution parameters: One can also fit a distribution on the set and use the distribution parameters as the embedding. Montanez et al. (2018) suggests using a Gaussian copula; for nodes with D-dimensional attributes, the dimension of the embedding is D +D2. 3. Set embedding: The deep sets architecture (Zaheer et al., 2017) is specifically proposed to produce a set embedding. If the single table model used is neural based, this architecture can be used to consume a set of nodes and outputs the embedding to condition on. Training of this module in this case is done end-to-end with the neural-based conditional generator.5. Learning and sampling Learning of this model involves learning the set embedding (if it is not fixed) and learning the conditional generative model. Sampling from the model is straightforward. 4.3 ESTABLISHING DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: We now describe how to extend the learning of each sub-model in p\u03b8(U,V,L) = p\u03b81(L)p\u03b82(U | L)p\u03b83(V | L,U) such that the learned parameter \u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83) with corresponding privacy budgets \u03f51, \u03f52, and \u03f53 (\u03f51 + \u03f52 + \u03f53 = \u03f5) is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP, which by sequential composition implies the whole synthetic data generation process is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP. Note that we assume the required privacy budgets for each component in each sub-model are given; how to optimally spend the budget is a question for future work that is out of the scope of this paper. p\u03b81(L) with \u03f51 For p\u03b81 , \u03b81 is the BJDD matrix PJ. As per the definition in section 2, we are interested in masking the presence of absence of a single node of either U or V, which is a stronger privacy notion than edge protection. To do so we follow the strategy in Sala et al. (2011); Proserpio et al. (2012) that uses the Laplace mechanism to make PJ \u03f5-DP. The main difference here is that we are operating on bipartite graphs instead of general graphs. Specifically, after measuring the BJD matrix J from data graphs, to achieve \u03f5-DP, we add noise following Lap(Sij\u03f5 ) where Sij = 4max(di, dj) to the i-th row, j-th column entry of J (Sala et al., 2011; Proserpio et al., 2012). p\u03b82(U | L) with \u03f52 For p\u03b82 , \u03b82 consists both the parameter of the node embedding model as well as that of the underlying generative model for the conditional. For the former, if such embedding is pre-fixed (referred as \u201cnode statistics\u201d in section 4.2.2), there is no learnable parameter for the node embedding model; otherwise we use DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) to train the embedding. For the underlying generative model, we choose some existing DP ones and follow their learning algorithms. p\u03b83(V | L,U) with \u03f53 For p\u03b83 , \u03b83 consists both the parameter of the set embedding model as well as that of the underlying generative model for the conditional. For the former, if such embedding is pre-fixed (referred as \u201cstatistics\u201d in section 4.2.3), there is no learnable parameter for the node embedding model; if such embedding is from Gaussian copula (the second option in section 4.2.3), we use the differentially private copula from Li et al. (2014); if such embedding is based on the deep sets architecture, which is only defined when it can be trained end-to-end with the generative model, we use DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) for training. For the underlying generative model not trained jointly, we choose some existing DP ones and follow their learning algorithms. It should be noted that the proposed formulation is flexible enough to allow for the privacy protection of the nodes from only one of U and V but not the other. For instance, if we choose to protect only U, we can set \u03f53 =\u221e when learning p\u03b83(V | L,U) and dj = 0 for all j when learning p\u03b81(L), making the overall synthetic data generation process (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP (\u03f51 + \u03f52 = \u03f5). 5 EVALUATION: Dataset We consider the MOVIELENS in our evaluation. MOVIELENS is a dataset that contains users\u2019 ratings to different movies (Harper & Konstan, 2015). The user and movie tables have their 5As there is no existing method to train deep sets in an unsupervised manner, it cannot be used with classic models like Bayesian networks. This, however, is an interesting future work that is out of the scope of this paper. own attributes such as user ages and movie genres and have a many-to-many relationship through existing ratings. We choose MOVIELENS as it is a commonly used datasets to study graph properties (Harper & Konstan, 2015; Baldesi et al., 2018; Belletti et al., 2019). Pre-processing We discretize all features into maximally 30 bins. Note this discretization step is optional: for our study, it is meant to make modeling and evaluation easier, which is an orthogonal consideration to the main point of the study which is to assess the performance of many-to-many modelling. Also note we do not use any privacy budget during pre-processing by assuming all information needed are public, which is again a separate concern that is out of the scope of this paper. 5.1 QUALITY OF MANY-TO-MANY MODELING: In this section, we evaluate the quality of the proposed model in terms of synthetic data similarity. We consider a set of baselines as well as two realizations of the proposed method, which we explain next. Baseline We consider SDV (Montanez et al., 2018) as the baseline method in our evaluation.6 SDV decomposes many-to-many relationships into multiple one-to-many ones and has the \u201cmultiple parents\u201d (discussed in section 3). To handle this, instead of randomly picking one table as the parent as suggested by Montanez et al. (2018), we experiment both options and report the one with better results. Two model instances from the proposed framework The proposed framework enables a range of new generative models with different options in each submodel detailed in section 4.2. In this evaluation, we focus on two typical ones built on different single table models: a Bayesian network with the network building method from Zhang et al. (2017), referred as BN, and an autoregressive model in which each conditional is modelled by a neural network, referred as NeuralAR. The two realizations are then (i) a classic non-parametric approach in which the single table models used are BN, referred as Bayesian many-to-many (BayesM2M) and (ii) a neural-based approach in which the single table models used are NeuralAR, referred as neural many-to-many (NeuralM2M). In both realizations, for p(L), we use the 2K-generator. In BayesM2M, for p(U | L), we use node statistics with d-step counts for d = 1, 2; for p(V | L,U), we use summary statistics with count, sum, n-th order moments for n = 1, 2, 3 and q-percent quantiles for q = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. In NeuralM2M, for p(U | L), we use node2vec to extract node embeddings; for p(V | L,U), we use the deep sets architecture (Zaheer et al., 2017) to consume a set of node (equivalently a set of rows). Metrics We consider three sets of metrics to evaluate the generation quality. The first set consists metrics that specifically evaluate the quality of relationship generation, which are one minus the total variation distances between the dK-distributions of real and synthetic data for d = 1, 2 (bounded between 0 and 1). The second set consists the pairwise mutual information (MI) similarity for each table to evaluate the quality of individual tables. For a pair of real and synthetic tables, we first compute the normalized MI7 between each pair of columns in each table; for tables with m features, this gives a pair of m\u00d7m matrices. The MI similarity is then defined as the average Jaccard indices between each pair of entries. Compared to alternative metrics such as f -divergences, this metric is bounded between 0 and 1 thus is easy to interpret. The third set consists the metrics to capture correlations between table pairs rooted in their many-to-many relationships, i.e. cross-table similarity. For each pair, we join the tables by their links into a single table and compute the pairwise MI similarity for each pair between two tables; for a pair of two tables with m and n features, this gives a pair of m\u00d7n matrices. The MI similarity is then defined as the average Jaccard indices between each pair of entries. To help understand our metrics, we provide detailed definitions with step-by-step examples in appendix B. Table 1 summarizes the main results from experiments with the above setups. Compared to SDV, both realizations of the proposed method obtains better scores in terms of graph similarity (marginal and joint degree similarity). This supports our choice of using random graph generation as the starting point of the whole generative process. Among two realizations, NeuralM2M has a better score in MI similarity for U, indicating that the node representation from node2vec contains more information 6We use the official implementation of SDV at https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV in our experiments. 7For discrete X,Y , we have I(X;Y ) \u2264 min(H(X), H(Y )). Thus normalized MI is defined as I(X;Y )/min(H(X), H(Y )), which is bounded between 0 and 1. than a simple-minded node statistics. On top of this, NeuralM2M also has a larger the gain/different between MI similarity for U and V than BayesM2M, indicating that deep sets architecture learn better set representation than fixed summary statistics. As a result of using random graph generation and learnable neural-based representations, NeuralM2M has the best cross-table similarity. 5.2 PERFORMANCE UNDER DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY CONSTRAINTS: For the two typical realizations of the proposed framework, we now evaluate how the generation quality of their differentially private variants changes with different privacy budgets. We focus on the crosstable similarity in this section as it is the most comprehensive metric for many-to-many modelling. Privacy budgets For both realizations, we vary \u03f5 in {0.1, 10.0, 1, 000.0,\u221e}. For NeuralM2M, as it only satisfies approximate DP, we in addition set \u03b4 = 1\u00d7 10\u22125. Figure 3 summarizes the main results from experiments with the above setups. As it can be seen, even though NeuralM2M performs well in a non-DP setup, its performance drops quickly with even a slightly smaller privacy budget. In comparison, BayesM2M has a better privacy-similarity trade-off. The main reason behind this is that the components in NeuralM2M rely on iterative training in which noise is added per iteration in order to establish differential privacy, making it hard to optimally spend the privacy budget or to obtain a tight DP bound. On the other side, most of the component in BayesM2M are pre-fixed and BNs can achieve DP by only adding noises to the measurement (i.e. counting for discreized data) of each table column. 6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Limitation The overall quality of the proposed framework depends on the choice of random graph generation methods. In this paper, we mostly focus on the 2K-generator that can generate arbitary-sized graphs but it at its best matches the 2K-distributions of the real data. Some other graph generation methods such as Baldesi et al. (2018); Belletti et al. (2019) can capture more graph statistics but can only generate graphs with the same size as the data graph or expands it by a whole number. Societal impacts On the positive side, the proposed method improve SDG for many-to-many data and can be used to release such data with DP guarantees, protecting the privacy of relevant individuals. However, as all generative model-based SDG methods, the synthetic data may be different from the real one in certain ways, causing potential fairness issues. To conclude, this paper studies the challenge of building faithful generative models for many-to-many datasets and present a novel generation framework based on random graph generation, node and set representation learning. The proposed framework is demonstrated to be better than its closest competitor SDV in terms of the generation quality on the widely-studied MOVIELENS dataset. We also study the behaviour of proposed model under different DP constraints, highlighting potential future works. B DETAILED EXPLANATION OF METRICS USED IN SECTION 5: In section 5 we used a set of metrics that are not commonly used for evaluation. To repeat, the two reasons we prefer these metrics are (i) they are bounded between 0 and 1 and (ii) they are easy to compute once the data is discretized, e.g. not requirement for training a classifier for density ratio estimation in computing f -divergences. We now provide a more formal description of these metrics. B.1 DEGREE SIMILARITY Let p,q be the probability vectors representing the 1K-distribution (with the same support) of the real and synthetic graphs. The marginal degree similarity is defined as 1\u2212 1 2 TV(p,q) = 1\u2212 1 2 \u2211 i |pi \u2212 qi| where TV is the total variation distance and pi, qi are the i-th element of p,q. Let P,Q be the probability matrices representing the corresponding 2K-distribution (with the same support). Similarly, the joint degree similarity is defined as 1\u2212 1 2 TV(P,Q) = 1\u2212 1 2 \u2211 i,j |Pij \u2212Qij | where Pij , Qij are the i-th row, j-th column entry of P,Q. As TV(\u00b7, \u00b7) \u2208 [0, 2], it can be easily shown that the two above degree similarity metrics are bounded by 0 and 1 with 1 being the maximal and best value. B.2 MUTUAL INFORMATION SIMILARITY Let X,Y be two datasets with the same number of discrete columns/features (m). For each dataset, we compute the normalized mutual information between each pair of columns, giving the pairwise MI matrix. The normalized mutual information between two random variables X,Y is defined as nMI(X,Y ) := MI(X,Y ) min{H(X),H(Y )} = H(X) + H(Y )\u2212H(X,Y ) min{H(X),H(Y )} where MI refers to the mutual information and H refers to the Shannon entropy. This quantity is bounded by 0 and 1 due to (i) the positivity of entropy and (ii) the inequality below H(X,Y ) \u2265 max{H(X),H(Y )} property of joint entropy \u2212H(X,Y ) \u2264 min{\u2212H(X),\u2212H(Y )} multiply by \u2212 1 H(X) + H(Y )\u2212H(X,Y ) \u2264 H(X) + H(Y ) + min{\u2212H(X),\u2212H(Y )} add marginal entropies MI(X,Y ) \u2264 min{H(X),H(Y )} simplification . Then the pairwise MI matrix, e.g. M for X can be defined by its i-th row, j-th column entries Mij Mij := nMI(Xi, Xj) where Xi, Xj are the random variables for the i-th and j-th columns of the dataset X. As the dataset is assumed to be given in discrete, the entropy of each column and the joint entropy of a pair of columns can be easily estimated by first estimating the empirical probabilities followed by the definition of Shannon entropy. Let M,N be the pairwise MI matrices for X,Y respectively, the MI similarity is then defined as 1 m2 \u2211 i,j J(Mij , Nij) where Mij , Nij the i-th row, j-th column entries accordingly and J is the Jaccard index defined as J(A,B) = min{A,B} max{A,B} . It is easy to see this metric is bounded by 0 and 1 with 1 being the maximal and best value. Cross-table MI similarity To compute the cross-table MI similarity score, for a pair of real tables X1,X2 and synthetic tables Y1,Y2, we first join (join as in relational algebra or databases) the two table pairs (X1,X2 and Y1,Y2) into X and Y by the graph/links between them. Then, we simply follow the MI similarity described above to compute the score. C REPRODUCIBILITY: C.1 CODE We provide the source code for the key uncommon components in the experiments for inspection, namely the 2K generator and metrics for evaluation. Unfortunately, as we used proprietary implementation of single table models (Bayesian networks and autoregressive models) that would reveal our identity, we cannot provide source code dependent on them. However, we describe as much details as possible in the next section such that one can reproduce them using other implementation of single table models. We will also make them publicly available upon publication. C.2 EXPERIMENT DETAILS In this section we provide some experimental details that are missing in section 5. Bayesian networks For BNs, we set the number of parents to be 2. The network building algorithm follows (Zhang et al., 2017) exactly. Neural autoregressive models For NeuralARs, the architecture for each classifier is as follows:8 1. Each discrete variable is passed to an embedding layer with an embedding size of 20, after which all embeddings are concatenated, giving a input embedding of size de 2. (Optional) When the deep sets architecture is used, each node is passed to a linear layer with output size 10 (i.e. node embedding size), then summed (i.e. summation as the aggregation function) and passed to a linear layer with output size 50 (i.e. set embedding size). We also overload the notation de by this set embedding size if this step is performed. 3. The input embedding is passed to a multi-layer perceptron of de ReLU\u2212\u2192 50 ReLU\u2212\u2192 50 Softmax\u2212\u2192 do where ReLU refers to the rectified linear unit activation function, Softmax refers to the he softmax function and do is the output dimension, equal to the number of unique values of the output features. Data is split by 80/20 into training and validation sets. All training is done using the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) for maximally 1, 000 steps with a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 and a batch size of 500. We also use a learning rate scheduler with the sine function with exponential amplitude decay with a minimal learning rate of 2\u00d7 10\u22124 and a 5-epoch periodicity.9 Finally, early training is used based on the loss computed on the validation set: if there is no loss drop for 5 epochs, the training is early stopped. 8All neural networks are implemented using Flux.jl (https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl.) 9This is done using the SinExp from https://github.com/darsnack/ ParameterSchedulers.jl. node2vec We use the Julia implementation of node2vec.10 We keep all default parameters except setting the number of walks to be 10, the walk length to be 100, p = q = 2 and an embedding size of 20. Privacy accountant We apply a simple-minded way to spread the privacy budget. First, the privacy budget is evenly split among three sub-models. Second, within each sub-model, the budget is further evenly split to each component. For BNs, it means the network building and counting. For NeuralARs, we simply record the number of iterations used for training per classifier in the non-private version and evenly spread the privacy across all iterations. Note this (assuming the number of iterations per classifier is known) is for evaluation purpose only and by no means this strategy is an optimal way to spend the privacy budgets. C.3 TOTAL COMPUTATION RESOURCES All experiments are conducted on an Amazon EC2 instance of type c5.4xlarge with CPUs only. 10The code is available at https://github.com/ollin18/Node2Vec.jl.

The paper title is: Synthetic Data Generation of Many-to-Many Datasets via Random Graph Generation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Private data release has gained much attention in recent years due to new regulations in privacy such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To obey such regulations and to protect privacy, a popular approach from the machine learning community called synthetic data generation (SDG) is developed in various domains (Nowok et al., 2016; Montanez et al., 2018; Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Tucker et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Ziller et al., 2021). In SDG, synthetic data that is statistically similar but not identical to real data is released as a replacement of the real data to protect. On top of it, special attention has also been paid to make sure these methods work well on tabular data as most real-world datasets are stored as tables in databases (Montanez et al., 2018; Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020). At the core of most SDG methods are generative models\u2014probabilistic models that one can drawn samples from. Usually a generative model is firstly trained to capture the distribution of the private real data, and then samples are drawn from the model so they can be released as protected synthetic data. However, this procedure without extra care does not have guarantees privacy. To tackle this, research in this direction has also been focusing on differentially private generative models (Zhang et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018; Jordon et al., 2018)\u2014generative models that satisfy a notion of privacy called differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2014), which controls the amount of information individual datum can reveal. While real-world datasets usually consist of multiple tables with potential many-to-many relationships, SDG for such type of data is not well-studied. Most of recent work focuses on modeling tables independently (Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020) or considers generating many-to-many relationships but only for special cases such as one-to-many (Getoor et al., 2007; Montanez et al., 2018). As a side effect, privacy for multi-table SDG with manyto-many relationships is also under-studied. In fact, relationships in real data can also reveal private information (Sala et al., 2011; Proserpio et al., 2012). For example, in a customer-merchant dataset, the number of links to a merchant could reveal its identity because of its uncommon popularity. This paper studies the challenge of building faithful generative models (Webb et al., 2018) to synthesize data together with their many-to-many relationships, and proposes a novel factorization for many-to-many generative models, which leads to a scalable approach by combining results from random graph theory and representation learning. In short, our paper has the following contributions: 1. We study possible factorization of faithful generative models for many-to-many data and identify limitations of those taken by existing approaches. 2. We propose a novel factorization for modeling distributions over many-to-many data and we use it to develop a synthetic data generation framework using methods from random graph generation, node representation learning and set representation learning. 3. We extend the proposed framework to establish the notion of (\u03f5, \u03b4)-differential privacy. 4. We evaluate two model instances from our framework, BayesM2M and NeuralM2M, on the MOVIELENS dataset, demonstrating its superior performance over its closest competitor, SDV, especially on capturing information in many-to-many relationships. 2 BACKGROUND AND NOTATIONS: Bipartite and multipartite graphs A bipartite graph B := (U,V,L) is a tuple of two disjoint node sets U,V (called upper and lower nodes respectively) as well as a set of edges L between them. Each node is represented by a tuple of its index and attribute, e.g. nku := (i k u, x k u) \u2208 U for k = 1, . . . , |U|. Each edge is represented by a tuple of node indices, i.e. lk := (iku, i k v) \u2208 L for k = 1, . . . , |L|. Such edge sets can be represented as adjacency matrices G or biadjacency matrices B; see figure 1b for an illustration. A generalised notion of bipartite graphs called multipartite graphs, denoted as M := ({Tk1}Nk1=1, {L k2}Mk2=1), are graphs with N disjoint node sets and M \u2264 ( N 2 ) edge sets. Modeling datasets with many-to-many relationships 1Datasets with many-to-many relationships, such as relational databases, can be viewed as multipartite graphs. Denote the generating distribution of a given multipartite graph Mdata as pdata(M). The goal of this paper is to build a generative model p\u03b8(M) with learnable parameter \u03b8 and to develop a learning algorithm A1 that takesMdata as inputs and outputs the optimal model p\u03b8\u2217 with parameter \u03b8\u2217, s.t. p\u03b8\u2217(M) is close to pdata(M). After learning, a sample M\u0303 is drawn from the model and used as synthetic data; we denote this sampling process/algorithm as A2. Differential privacy In this work, we are interested in establishing the standard (\u03f5, \u03b4)-differential privacy, a.k.a. (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP or approximate DP. Denote A = A2 \u25e6 A1. We say a model p\u03b8 with A is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP according to the following definition (Dwork et al., 2014): Definition 1 ((\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP for p\u03b8 with A). A generative model p\u03b8 with the synthesis algorithm A is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP if for all S \u2286 Range(A) and for all B,B\u2032 that differ on a single element: P(A(B) \u2208 S) \u2264 exp(\u03f5)P(A(B\u2032) \u2208 S) + \u03b4. In our case, S is the output of the synthesis algorithm A\u2019s training procedure, while we are interested in the most general case (with strongest privacy protection) and define an element as a single node that could be part of either U or V. If \u03b4 = 0, we also call a model p\u03b8 with A satisfies \u03f5-differential privacy, i.e. \u03f5-DP. 1Note here we are intended to avoid using terms such as primary/foreign keys and parents/children from the relational database literature. This is because in order to model the joint distribution for a given dataset, parentchild directions can be rearranged for modeling convenience in favor of some particular factorization of the joint. Learning graph distributions Consider the distribution pdata(L) for a given set of edges Ldata. Unlike setup in work like Liao et al. (2019) in which multiple samples from pdata are given, we are presented with a single sample from pdata. Therefore, rather than replying on the standard notion of learning as probability divergence minimization using empirical samples, we consider learning a model p\u03b8(L) such that samples from it share similar graph properties as Ldata. Graph properties We consider the dK-distributions from Mahadevan et al. (2006) with d = 2, defined as the (joint) degree distribution of all pairs of d nodes in the graph.2 We call all graphs with a given dK-distributions dK-graphs. For example, 0K-graphs share the same graph density, 1K-graphs share the same distribution of node degrees, 2K-graphs share the same joint distributions of degrees of node pairs, etc. We call models that sample dK-graphs dK-generators. We consider the same notion for bipartite graphs, defining bipartite dK-graphs, and consider learning p\u03b8 that generates bipartite 2K-graphs of data. For a bipartite graph B, we denote its bipartite joint degree distribution (BJDD) as the empirical distribution of samples {(deg(n(iku)),deg(n(ikv)))} |L| k=1, where n(i) denotes the node with index i (similarly i(n) is the node index for node n) and deg(n) is the degree of the node n. Such empirical distribution can be represented as a matrix PJ along with the supports du,dv for both dimensions; see figure 1c for an illustration. One can also compute the (marginal) degree distributions of the upper or lower nodes from BJDD. For example, that of upper nodes pu is a probability vector (a vector of whose elements sum up to 1) in which its i-th element pu[i] = \u2211 j PJ[i, j]/du[i]. 3 RELATED WORK: Generative models for tabular data In general, there are two categories of generative models that have been successfully applied to tabular data. One is based on classic graphical models. This includes directed graphical models such as Bayesian networks PrivBayes (PrivBayes; Zhang et al., 2017) and auto-regressive models (synthpop; Nowok et al., 2016) as well as undirected graphical models such as factor graphs (MST; McKenna et al., 2019). For these models, data is usually discretized in order to facilitate efficient learning. Another is based on recently emerged deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs; Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs; Goodfellow et al., 2014). Unlike graphical models, work on deep generative models has been mostly focusing on developing methods to directly model heterogeneous data, which are mixed-type data with different types of continuous (real, positive real, etc) and discrete variables (categorical, ordinal, etc), which includes specific pre-processing steps, neural network architecture design, improving training, etc (Xu & Veeramachaneni, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020); for surveys, see Fan et al. (2020); Borisov et al. (2021). Generative models for relational data Probabilistic relational models (PRMs) (Friedman et al., 1999; Getoor et al., 2007) is the most well-established approach to building distributions over relational data. Getoor et al. (2007) describes two ways of dealing with structural uncertainty but only with learning methods for structures, i.e. finding the best structures. While it is possible to extend these methods to samplers by using Markov chain Monte Carlo for sampling, applying them to datasets at scale would be challenging. Mostly related to our work is Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) (Patki et al., 2016; Montanez et al., 2018), which is based on PRMs and considers the task of synthesizing relational data with links. However, SDV only models one-to-many relationships by recording the children count per row and generates one-to-many links by sampling the number of children. Because SDV cannot handle many-to-one relationships, the so-called \u201cmultiple parents\u201d problem occurs in certain scenarios (Montanez et al., 2018). For example, consider three tables A\u2212B \u2212 C forming an one-many-one relationship. At generation time, SDV has to generate A and C first and conditionally generates B given A and C, at which stage it is unclear whether the children counts in A or C should be used. Montanez et al. (2018) suggests to either randomly pick a table for the conditional generation or to perform weighted averaging between parents. Another related work based on PRMs is Ben Ishak et al. (2016), which describes a generator for many-to-many data 2With d increasing, samples from the dK-distributions become more similar to the data but generating dKgraphs is increasingly computationally complex; luckily 2K-graphs are sufficient for most practical purposes (Mahadevan et al., 2006). Also note that with d \u2192 \u221e, dK-series describe any given graph completely. In addition, from a privacy perspective, a large d means high sensitivity in the dK-series, which requires much more noise to be added for achieving \u03f5-DP for a given \u03f5 (Sala et al., 2011). with links. However, the work only targets generating testing data\u2014data used as test examples in a software engineering setup. Thus, the generator is learnable. Random graph generation One line of work in this direction is built on the classic degree sequence problem, which is the problem of finding some or all graphs with a given degree sequence (Molloy & Reed, 1995). Mahadevan et al. (2006) introduces the notion of dK-graphs and studies generating them via classic random graph methods, such as the pseudograph or configuration approach (Molloy & Reed, 1995; Aiello et al., 2000). As classic methods in general cannot correctly sample dK-graphs with d \u2265 2, a few follow-up works improves the sampling for these graphs (Stanton & Pinar, 2012; Gjoka et al., 2013; 2015). Unlike previous work that focuses on general graphs, Boroojeni et al. (2017) specifically considers sampling bipartite graphs that preserves the 2K-distribution. Another line of methods, unlike above-mentioned methods that can generate arbitrary-sized graphs, can only generate graphs with the same size as the data graph, e.g. spectral-based approach in Baldesi et al. (2018), or expands it by a whole number, e.g. method based on fractal expansions from Belletti et al. (2019). Differentially private SDG In terms of DP generative models, a few graphical models discussed above (PrivBayes, MST) are originally proposed in a DP context. For deep generative models, there are two generic training algorithms that make models differentially private: differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD; Abadi et al., 2016) and private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE; Papernot et al., 2016; 2018), leading to methods such as DP-GAN (Xie et al., 2018) and PATE-GAN (Jordon et al., 2018). Regarding random graph generation, Sala et al. (2011); Proserpio et al. (2012) consider the release of graphs in a differentially private manner based on dK-generators. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work specifically targeting differentially private synthesis of bipartite graphs, nor previous work for differentially private synthesis for many-to-many datasets. 4 MODELING MANY-TO-MANY DATASETS WITH DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: In this section, we first discuss the challenges of building faithful generative models (Webb et al., 2018) for many-to-many datasets by studying possible factorization of the joint distribution (section 4.1), during which we also identify the limitations of the factorization that existing approaches are based on. Based on a novel factorization, we use methods from random graph generation, node representation learning and set representation learning to develop a new type of scalable generative model for manyto-many datasets section 4.2. Finally, we extend the model to be (\u03f5, \u03b4)-differentially private section 4.3. Also note that in this section, for brevity, we omit the model parameter \u03b8 in p\u03b8 unless it is necessary. 4.1 FAITHFUL GENERATIVE MODELS FOR MANY-TO-MANY DATASETS: To simplify the discussion, we first focus on modeling bipartite graph and will later extend it to multipartite graphs. The term \u201cfaithful\u201d as in faithful generative models refers to the fact that the model does not introduce any conditional independence that is not true in general (Webb et al., 2018). For the joint distribution p(U,V,L), where U,V are two tables with rows linked by edges in L, that we are interested in, considering the fact that the roles of U and V are exchangeable, there are only three possible factorization of the joint p(U,V,L) := pjoint: FACTORIZATION S FACTORIZATION E FACTORIZATION A pjoint p(U)p(L | U)p(V | U,L) p(U)p(V | U)p(L | U,V) p(L)p(U | L)p(V | U,L) Within all factorization, there are a 6 sub-models in total to consider. \u2022 p(U) (the single-table model) can be any generative model for single table generation. \u2022 p(L | U) (the semi-conditional edge model) requires to generate edges based on one of the table\u2014the row count generation used in Montanez et al. (2018) is in fact an example of such. However, a general case of this model can be computational challenging: For any subset of U, it requires checking if they together link to an existing or new node in V. \u2022 p(V | U,L) (the conditional table model) requires to generate each node in V based on the first table and all connections. As per node in V is connected to a subset of nodes in U via L, it requires to condition on a set of varied number of nodes for modelling, which can be done using a aggregation function or a aggregator (Getoor et al., 2007; Montanez et al., 2018). another (while marginalizing all edges). This model can be computational challenge to implement. A potential work-around is to model the two-table joint p(U,V) directly by joining two tables and apply a generative model on the joined table. However, this could easily lead to table with an intractable scale. And perhaps more importantly, it is hard to undo this join operation from the synthetic data to recover individual tables in general.3. \u2022 p(L | U,V) (the edge prediction model) predicts the existences of edges between node pairs and is essential probabilistic models used in many recommender systems. \u2022 p(L) (the edge model) requires to model the edges (i.e. the graph) unconditionally\u2014this is the type of random graph models that usually studied in random graph theory. \u2022 p(U | L) (the edge-conditional table model) requires to generate one of the table given the topology of edges. One way to achieve such conditioning is by using a node embedding to condition on. This is also related to node attributes generation/prediction in graph models. As discussed, approaches from Getoor et al. (2007); Montanez et al. (2018) correspond to FACTORIZATION S and there is no easy way to extend p(L | U) to a general many-to-many case. FACTORIZATION E also has the scalability issue in p(V | U) (or similarly in p(U,V)) as discussed. Our approach will then be based on FACTORIZATION A that does not have such concerns/limitations. Considering edges attributes So far our discussion assumes there are no edge attributes, which is not true in general, e.g. ratings in MOVIELENS. The way to deal with this is by adding an extra edge attribute model that is similar to p(L | U,V) but generates edge attributes instead. One can use any edge prediction model for this purpose\u2014rather than predicting the existence of edges it generates the edge attributes\u2014and the corresponding generation step is performed after all other data is generated. Extending to multipartite graphs For a given datasets with multiple tables, we assume the links at table level are given. Thus we can impose an arbitrary order on the tables and generate the edges and tables in order; this is similar to how an arbitrary order is imposed on random variables as in Bayesian networks. Extra care needs to be taken for graph generation when generating graphs involving tables with more than one connection, which will be explained in section 4.2.1. 4.2 RANDOM GRAPH GENERATION BASED MANY-TO-MANY SYNTHESIS: We now describe how to model the three distributions in our proposed factorization pjoint = p(L)p(U | L)p(V | U,L): p(L) in section 4.2.1, p(U | L) in section 4.2.2 and p(V | L,U) in section 4.2.3. Figure 2 also provides an illustration of the learning and sampling process for the proposed method. 4.2.1 GRAPH MODELING VIA RANDOM GRAPH GENERATION: We consider using bipartite dK-generators to model p(L) that take in a target BJD J and generate random graph satisfying this J. Boroojeni et al. (2017) proves the existence of an algorithm for sampling bipartite graphs with a target BJD J, giving rise to bipartite 2K-generators. The idea is 3As a concrete example, suppose U has a single column C1 with a continuous variable, V has another column C2 (with either a continuous or discrete variable) and L indicates every row in U is linked with two rows in V. After joining two tables, we will arrive with a table in which two columns C1, C2 in which there are duplicated elements in C1 due to the one-to-many relationship; it is also possible to undo the join operation on this real dataset. However, for any generative model that treats C1 as continuous variable, the probability of having duplicated elements in C1 is exactly 0, which means any synthetic dataset would effectively giving a dataset with one-to-one relationship between U and V, after undoing the join operation. to first generate a bipartite graph based on random pairing, after which the graph matches the 2K distribution but has potentially repeated edges. Then, a rewiring process is performed to make the graph simple\u2014a graph is called simple if there is no loop or multiple edges (West et al., 2001). Boroojeni et al. (2017) shows that such rewiring process exists and can always produce a graph with the target BJD. Since the prescribed algorithm of rewiring in Boroojeni et al. (2017) contains a few mistakes/typos, we present a corrected version in algorithm 1 in appendix A. To complete the description of p\u03b8(L), we also need to define how to obtain J that bipartite algorithm 1 take in. For this, we draw samples from PJ with a prescribed number of edges. However, as this might invalidate the input to algorithm 14, which may cause infinite loops in rewiring, we stop the rewiring process after a predefined maximum number of iterations. To this end, sampling from J together with algorithm 1 define p\u03b8(L) through its generative process, where \u03b8 is the BJDD matrix PJ. \u201cBackward compatibility\u201d of the graph generator One consideration taken into account while selecting the model for p(L) was \u201cbackward compatibility\u201d to one-to-many and many-to-one problems. This refers to the cases where if the data graph contains only one-to-many relationships, the generated graphs shall do so. The 2K-generator indeed satisfies this property while, in contrast, spectral-based graph generation methods such as Baldesi et al. (2018) usually fail to hold it. Learning and sampling Learning of this model only involves computing the BJDD matrix from the data graph; if a table is involved in multiple edges, the joint distribution of all degrees per node is learned. Sampling from the model is defined by sampling from PJ followed by algorithm 1. 4.2.2 CONDITIONAL MODELING VIA NODE EMBEDDING: We now discuss how to model upper nodes U conditioned on edges L. This distribution essentially models a set of nodes given topology, which can be dealt with the use of node embedding as: p(U | L) = |U|\u220f k=1 p(niu | \u03b2(L, i)), (1) where the node encoder \u03b2 computes node embedding of node i in graph L; its range is ran(\u03b2) = RH\u03b2 , where H\u03b2 is the dimension of the node embedding. As such, once given \u03b2, this distribution can be modeled by any existing conditional generative model. A few candidates of such \u03b2 are: 1. Node statistics: d-step neighbour count (number of neighbours of distance d) can be used. As an simple example, d = 1 means using node degrees as 1d embeddings. It can be generalised to use a collection of counts with H\u03b2 different d, giving to an embedding of size H\u03b2 . 2. Node embedding: Methods to learn node embedding such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) and node2vec (Grover & Leskovec, 2016) can also be used as \u03b2. Learning and sampling Learning of this model involves learning the node embedding (if it is not fixed) and learning the conditional generative model. Sampling from the model is straightforward. 4.2.3 CONDITIONAL MODELING VIA SET EMBEDDING: Consider a node nv \u2208 V with neighbors ne(nv) \u2286 U. It is easy to see that, given ne(nv), nv is conditionally independent with any other n\u2032v \u2208 V. Thus, we have p(V | L,U) = \u220f nv\u2208V p(nv | ne(nv)), where p(nv | ne(nv)) is a conditional distribution whose condition is a multiset\u2014a set that allows repeated elements. Without imposing any order on ne(nv), one way to condition on this through a fixed-size set embedding computed by an aggregator \u03b3, which leads to our model p(V | L,U) = \u220f nv\u2208V p(nv | \u03b3(ne(nv))). (2) Equation 2 requires an aggregator \u03b3 : pow(U) 7\u2192 RH\u03b3 where pow(U) is the power set of U and H\u03b3 is the dimension of the set embedding. A few candidates of such \u03b3 are: 4Algorithm 1 assumes two conditions for the input J: (i) J[i, j] \u2264 ( \u2211 j J[i, j]/du[i])( \u2211 i J[i, j]/dv[j]) and (ii) the degree sums for upper and lower nodes are the same (which would be true as long as \u2211 j J[i, j]/du[i]) is integer for all i and \u2211 i J[i, j]/du[j] is integer for all j) (Boroojeni et al., 2017). 1. Summary statistics: count, sum, n-th order moments, q-percent quantiles, etc. can be used. If both count and sum are used and d different moments and quantiles are used, the total dimension of the embedding is D+D+ d\u00d7D+ d\u00d7D for nodes with D-dimensional attributes. 2. Distribution parameters: One can also fit a distribution on the set and use the distribution parameters as the embedding. Montanez et al. (2018) suggests using a Gaussian copula; for nodes with D-dimensional attributes, the dimension of the embedding is D +D2. 3. Set embedding: The deep sets architecture (Zaheer et al., 2017) is specifically proposed to produce a set embedding. If the single table model used is neural based, this architecture can be used to consume a set of nodes and outputs the embedding to condition on. Training of this module in this case is done end-to-end with the neural-based conditional generator.5. Learning and sampling Learning of this model involves learning the set embedding (if it is not fixed) and learning the conditional generative model. Sampling from the model is straightforward. 4.3 ESTABLISHING DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: We now describe how to extend the learning of each sub-model in p\u03b8(U,V,L) = p\u03b81(L)p\u03b82(U | L)p\u03b83(V | L,U) such that the learned parameter \u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83) with corresponding privacy budgets \u03f51, \u03f52, and \u03f53 (\u03f51 + \u03f52 + \u03f53 = \u03f5) is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP, which by sequential composition implies the whole synthetic data generation process is (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP. Note that we assume the required privacy budgets for each component in each sub-model are given; how to optimally spend the budget is a question for future work that is out of the scope of this paper. p\u03b81(L) with \u03f51 For p\u03b81 , \u03b81 is the BJDD matrix PJ. As per the definition in section 2, we are interested in masking the presence of absence of a single node of either U or V, which is a stronger privacy notion than edge protection. To do so we follow the strategy in Sala et al. (2011); Proserpio et al. (2012) that uses the Laplace mechanism to make PJ \u03f5-DP. The main difference here is that we are operating on bipartite graphs instead of general graphs. Specifically, after measuring the BJD matrix J from data graphs, to achieve \u03f5-DP, we add noise following Lap(Sij\u03f5 ) where Sij = 4max(di, dj) to the i-th row, j-th column entry of J (Sala et al., 2011; Proserpio et al., 2012). p\u03b82(U | L) with \u03f52 For p\u03b82 , \u03b82 consists both the parameter of the node embedding model as well as that of the underlying generative model for the conditional. For the former, if such embedding is pre-fixed (referred as \u201cnode statistics\u201d in section 4.2.2), there is no learnable parameter for the node embedding model; otherwise we use DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) to train the embedding. For the underlying generative model, we choose some existing DP ones and follow their learning algorithms. p\u03b83(V | L,U) with \u03f53 For p\u03b83 , \u03b83 consists both the parameter of the set embedding model as well as that of the underlying generative model for the conditional. For the former, if such embedding is pre-fixed (referred as \u201cstatistics\u201d in section 4.2.3), there is no learnable parameter for the node embedding model; if such embedding is from Gaussian copula (the second option in section 4.2.3), we use the differentially private copula from Li et al. (2014); if such embedding is based on the deep sets architecture, which is only defined when it can be trained end-to-end with the generative model, we use DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) for training. For the underlying generative model not trained jointly, we choose some existing DP ones and follow their learning algorithms. It should be noted that the proposed formulation is flexible enough to allow for the privacy protection of the nodes from only one of U and V but not the other. For instance, if we choose to protect only U, we can set \u03f53 =\u221e when learning p\u03b83(V | L,U) and dj = 0 for all j when learning p\u03b81(L), making the overall synthetic data generation process (\u03f5, \u03b4)-DP (\u03f51 + \u03f52 = \u03f5). 5 EVALUATION: Dataset We consider the MOVIELENS in our evaluation. MOVIELENS is a dataset that contains users\u2019 ratings to different movies (Harper & Konstan, 2015). The user and movie tables have their 5As there is no existing method to train deep sets in an unsupervised manner, it cannot be used with classic models like Bayesian networks. This, however, is an interesting future work that is out of the scope of this paper. own attributes such as user ages and movie genres and have a many-to-many relationship through existing ratings. We choose MOVIELENS as it is a commonly used datasets to study graph properties (Harper & Konstan, 2015; Baldesi et al., 2018; Belletti et al., 2019). Pre-processing We discretize all features into maximally 30 bins. Note this discretization step is optional: for our study, it is meant to make modeling and evaluation easier, which is an orthogonal consideration to the main point of the study which is to assess the performance of many-to-many modelling. Also note we do not use any privacy budget during pre-processing by assuming all information needed are public, which is again a separate concern that is out of the scope of this paper. 5.1 QUALITY OF MANY-TO-MANY MODELING: In this section, we evaluate the quality of the proposed model in terms of synthetic data similarity. We consider a set of baselines as well as two realizations of the proposed method, which we explain next. Baseline We consider SDV (Montanez et al., 2018) as the baseline method in our evaluation.6 SDV decomposes many-to-many relationships into multiple one-to-many ones and has the \u201cmultiple parents\u201d (discussed in section 3). To handle this, instead of randomly picking one table as the parent as suggested by Montanez et al. (2018), we experiment both options and report the one with better results. Two model instances from the proposed framework The proposed framework enables a range of new generative models with different options in each submodel detailed in section 4.2. In this evaluation, we focus on two typical ones built on different single table models: a Bayesian network with the network building method from Zhang et al. (2017), referred as BN, and an autoregressive model in which each conditional is modelled by a neural network, referred as NeuralAR. The two realizations are then (i) a classic non-parametric approach in which the single table models used are BN, referred as Bayesian many-to-many (BayesM2M) and (ii) a neural-based approach in which the single table models used are NeuralAR, referred as neural many-to-many (NeuralM2M). In both realizations, for p(L), we use the 2K-generator. In BayesM2M, for p(U | L), we use node statistics with d-step counts for d = 1, 2; for p(V | L,U), we use summary statistics with count, sum, n-th order moments for n = 1, 2, 3 and q-percent quantiles for q = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. In NeuralM2M, for p(U | L), we use node2vec to extract node embeddings; for p(V | L,U), we use the deep sets architecture (Zaheer et al., 2017) to consume a set of node (equivalently a set of rows). Metrics We consider three sets of metrics to evaluate the generation quality. The first set consists metrics that specifically evaluate the quality of relationship generation, which are one minus the total variation distances between the dK-distributions of real and synthetic data for d = 1, 2 (bounded between 0 and 1). The second set consists the pairwise mutual information (MI) similarity for each table to evaluate the quality of individual tables. For a pair of real and synthetic tables, we first compute the normalized MI7 between each pair of columns in each table; for tables with m features, this gives a pair of m\u00d7m matrices. The MI similarity is then defined as the average Jaccard indices between each pair of entries. Compared to alternative metrics such as f -divergences, this metric is bounded between 0 and 1 thus is easy to interpret. The third set consists the metrics to capture correlations between table pairs rooted in their many-to-many relationships, i.e. cross-table similarity. For each pair, we join the tables by their links into a single table and compute the pairwise MI similarity for each pair between two tables; for a pair of two tables with m and n features, this gives a pair of m\u00d7n matrices. The MI similarity is then defined as the average Jaccard indices between each pair of entries. To help understand our metrics, we provide detailed definitions with step-by-step examples in appendix B. Table 1 summarizes the main results from experiments with the above setups. Compared to SDV, both realizations of the proposed method obtains better scores in terms of graph similarity (marginal and joint degree similarity). This supports our choice of using random graph generation as the starting point of the whole generative process. Among two realizations, NeuralM2M has a better score in MI similarity for U, indicating that the node representation from node2vec contains more information 6We use the official implementation of SDV at https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV in our experiments. 7For discrete X,Y , we have I(X;Y ) \u2264 min(H(X), H(Y )). Thus normalized MI is defined as I(X;Y )/min(H(X), H(Y )), which is bounded between 0 and 1. than a simple-minded node statistics. On top of this, NeuralM2M also has a larger the gain/different between MI similarity for U and V than BayesM2M, indicating that deep sets architecture learn better set representation than fixed summary statistics. As a result of using random graph generation and learnable neural-based representations, NeuralM2M has the best cross-table similarity. 5.2 PERFORMANCE UNDER DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY CONSTRAINTS: For the two typical realizations of the proposed framework, we now evaluate how the generation quality of their differentially private variants changes with different privacy budgets. We focus on the crosstable similarity in this section as it is the most comprehensive metric for many-to-many modelling. Privacy budgets For both realizations, we vary \u03f5 in {0.1, 10.0, 1, 000.0,\u221e}. For NeuralM2M, as it only satisfies approximate DP, we in addition set \u03b4 = 1\u00d7 10\u22125. Figure 3 summarizes the main results from experiments with the above setups. As it can be seen, even though NeuralM2M performs well in a non-DP setup, its performance drops quickly with even a slightly smaller privacy budget. In comparison, BayesM2M has a better privacy-similarity trade-off. The main reason behind this is that the components in NeuralM2M rely on iterative training in which noise is added per iteration in order to establish differential privacy, making it hard to optimally spend the privacy budget or to obtain a tight DP bound. On the other side, most of the component in BayesM2M are pre-fixed and BNs can achieve DP by only adding noises to the measurement (i.e. counting for discreized data) of each table column. 6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Limitation The overall quality of the proposed framework depends on the choice of random graph generation methods. In this paper, we mostly focus on the 2K-generator that can generate arbitary-sized graphs but it at its best matches the 2K-distributions of the real data. Some other graph generation methods such as Baldesi et al. (2018); Belletti et al. (2019) can capture more graph statistics but can only generate graphs with the same size as the data graph or expands it by a whole number. Societal impacts On the positive side, the proposed method improve SDG for many-to-many data and can be used to release such data with DP guarantees, protecting the privacy of relevant individuals. However, as all generative model-based SDG methods, the synthetic data may be different from the real one in certain ways, causing potential fairness issues. To conclude, this paper studies the challenge of building faithful generative models for many-to-many datasets and present a novel generation framework based on random graph generation, node and set representation learning. The proposed framework is demonstrated to be better than its closest competitor SDV in terms of the generation quality on the widely-studied MOVIELENS dataset. We also study the behaviour of proposed model under different DP constraints, highlighting potential future works. B DETAILED EXPLANATION OF METRICS USED IN SECTION 5: In section 5 we used a set of metrics that are not commonly used for evaluation. To repeat, the two reasons we prefer these metrics are (i) they are bounded between 0 and 1 and (ii) they are easy to compute once the data is discretized, e.g. not requirement for training a classifier for density ratio estimation in computing f -divergences. We now provide a more formal description of these metrics. B.1 DEGREE SIMILARITY Let p,q be the probability vectors representing the 1K-distribution (with the same support) of the real and synthetic graphs. The marginal degree similarity is defined as 1\u2212 1 2 TV(p,q) = 1\u2212 1 2 \u2211 i |pi \u2212 qi| where TV is the total variation distance and pi, qi are the i-th element of p,q. Let P,Q be the probability matrices representing the corresponding 2K-distribution (with the same support). Similarly, the joint degree similarity is defined as 1\u2212 1 2 TV(P,Q) = 1\u2212 1 2 \u2211 i,j |Pij \u2212Qij | where Pij , Qij are the i-th row, j-th column entry of P,Q. As TV(\u00b7, \u00b7) \u2208 [0, 2], it can be easily shown that the two above degree similarity metrics are bounded by 0 and 1 with 1 being the maximal and best value. B.2 MUTUAL INFORMATION SIMILARITY Let X,Y be two datasets with the same number of discrete columns/features (m). For each dataset, we compute the normalized mutual information between each pair of columns, giving the pairwise MI matrix. The normalized mutual information between two random variables X,Y is defined as nMI(X,Y ) := MI(X,Y ) min{H(X),H(Y )} = H(X) + H(Y )\u2212H(X,Y ) min{H(X),H(Y )} where MI refers to the mutual information and H refers to the Shannon entropy. This quantity is bounded by 0 and 1 due to (i) the positivity of entropy and (ii) the inequality below H(X,Y ) \u2265 max{H(X),H(Y )} property of joint entropy \u2212H(X,Y ) \u2264 min{\u2212H(X),\u2212H(Y )} multiply by \u2212 1 H(X) + H(Y )\u2212H(X,Y ) \u2264 H(X) + H(Y ) + min{\u2212H(X),\u2212H(Y )} add marginal entropies MI(X,Y ) \u2264 min{H(X),H(Y )} simplification . Then the pairwise MI matrix, e.g. M for X can be defined by its i-th row, j-th column entries Mij Mij := nMI(Xi, Xj) where Xi, Xj are the random variables for the i-th and j-th columns of the dataset X. As the dataset is assumed to be given in discrete, the entropy of each column and the joint entropy of a pair of columns can be easily estimated by first estimating the empirical probabilities followed by the definition of Shannon entropy. Let M,N be the pairwise MI matrices for X,Y respectively, the MI similarity is then defined as 1 m2 \u2211 i,j J(Mij , Nij) where Mij , Nij the i-th row, j-th column entries accordingly and J is the Jaccard index defined as J(A,B) = min{A,B} max{A,B} . It is easy to see this metric is bounded by 0 and 1 with 1 being the maximal and best value. Cross-table MI similarity To compute the cross-table MI similarity score, for a pair of real tables X1,X2 and synthetic tables Y1,Y2, we first join (join as in relational algebra or databases) the two table pairs (X1,X2 and Y1,Y2) into X and Y by the graph/links between them. Then, we simply follow the MI similarity described above to compute the score. C REPRODUCIBILITY: C.1 CODE We provide the source code for the key uncommon components in the experiments for inspection, namely the 2K generator and metrics for evaluation. Unfortunately, as we used proprietary implementation of single table models (Bayesian networks and autoregressive models) that would reveal our identity, we cannot provide source code dependent on them. However, we describe as much details as possible in the next section such that one can reproduce them using other implementation of single table models. We will also make them publicly available upon publication. C.2 EXPERIMENT DETAILS In this section we provide some experimental details that are missing in section 5. Bayesian networks For BNs, we set the number of parents to be 2. The network building algorithm follows (Zhang et al., 2017) exactly. Neural autoregressive models For NeuralARs, the architecture for each classifier is as follows:8 1. Each discrete variable is passed to an embedding layer with an embedding size of 20, after which all embeddings are concatenated, giving a input embedding of size de 2. (Optional) When the deep sets architecture is used, each node is passed to a linear layer with output size 10 (i.e. node embedding size), then summed (i.e. summation as the aggregation function) and passed to a linear layer with output size 50 (i.e. set embedding size). We also overload the notation de by this set embedding size if this step is performed. 3. The input embedding is passed to a multi-layer perceptron of de ReLU\u2212\u2192 50 ReLU\u2212\u2192 50 Softmax\u2212\u2192 do where ReLU refers to the rectified linear unit activation function, Softmax refers to the he softmax function and do is the output dimension, equal to the number of unique values of the output features. Data is split by 80/20 into training and validation sets. All training is done using the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) for maximally 1, 000 steps with a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 and a batch size of 500. We also use a learning rate scheduler with the sine function with exponential amplitude decay with a minimal learning rate of 2\u00d7 10\u22124 and a 5-epoch periodicity.9 Finally, early training is used based on the loss computed on the validation set: if there is no loss drop for 5 epochs, the training is early stopped. 8All neural networks are implemented using Flux.jl (https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl.) 9This is done using the SinExp from https://github.com/darsnack/ ParameterSchedulers.jl. node2vec We use the Julia implementation of node2vec.10 We keep all default parameters except setting the number of walks to be 10, the walk length to be 100, p = q = 2 and an embedding size of 20. Privacy accountant We apply a simple-minded way to spread the privacy budget. First, the privacy budget is evenly split among three sub-models. Second, within each sub-model, the budget is further evenly split to each component. For BNs, it means the network building and counting. For NeuralARs, we simply record the number of iterations used for training per classifier in the non-private version and evenly spread the privacy across all iterations. Note this (assuming the number of iterations per classifier is known) is for evaluation purpose only and by no means this strategy is an optimal way to spend the privacy budgets. C.3 TOTAL COMPUTATION RESOURCES All experiments are conducted on an Amazon EC2 instance of type c5.4xlarge with CPUs only. 10The code is available at https://github.com/ollin18/Node2Vec.jl.

To provide a thorough and meaningful evaluation of its statistical rigor, differential privacy guarantees, and overall validity, I need the actual description of the methodology.\\n\\n**Without the methodology, I cannot offer specific feedback.**\\n\\nHowever, I can provide a comprehensive framework and list the critical questions and considerations I would apply to evaluate *any* such methodology, specifically focusing on the areas you highlighted (factorization, random graph generation, and differential privacy).\\n\\nPlease provide the details of your methodology, including:\\n1.  **Overview of the Approach:** What are the main steps? What kind of data is it designed for (tabular, network, time-series, etc.)?\\n2.  **Details on Factorization:** What type of factorization is used (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Tensor Factorization, Graph Factorization)? Why is it chosen? How are the factors derived? How are they used to generate synthetic data?\\n3.  **Details on Random Graph Generation:** If applicable, how is a graph involved? Is it a core component or used for specific aspects (e.g., modeling dependencies)? What kind of random graph model is used (e.g., Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, or a custom model)? How are its parameters determined?\\n4.  **Details on Differential Privacy (DP) Application:**\\n    *   At what stage(s) is DP applied (e.g., to the raw data, during factorization, to model parameters, during graph generation)?\\n    *   What specific DP mechanism(s) are used (e.g., Laplace, Gaussian, Exponential Mechanism)?\\n    *   What are the chosen privacy parameters ($\\\\epsilon, \\\\delta$)?\\n    *   How is the sensitivity of the queries/functions calculated?\\n    *   How is the overall privacy budget managed if multiple DP steps are involved?\\n    *   Is there a formal proof sketch or argument for the DP guarantee?\\n5.  **How Synthetic Data is Generated:** The process from the factored components and/or graph to the final synthetic dataset.\\n6.  **Evaluation Metrics:** How do you plan to evaluate the utility and privacy of the synthetic data?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **General Framework for Evaluating a Synthetic Data Generation Methodology (Awaiting your Input):**\\n\\nOnce you provide your methodology, I will evaluate it against the following criteria:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **I. Statistical Rigor**\\n\\nThis section assesses how well the synthetic data preserves the statistical properties of the real data.\\n\\n1.  **Univariate Distributions:**\\n    *   How accurately do the marginal distributions of individual features in the synthetic data match those in the real data? (e.g., mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis for numerical; frequency counts for categorical).\\n    *   **Evaluation Metrics:** KL-Divergence, JS-Divergence, Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for continuous, Chi-squared for categorical).\\n\\n2.  **Multivariate Relationships (Correlations & Dependencies):**\\n    *   How well are pairwise correlations (Pearson, Spearman) preserved?\\n    *   Can the method capture higher-order dependencies (e.g., conditional distributions, non-linear relationships)?\\n    *   For sequence/time-series data, are temporal dependencies (autocorrelation, trends, seasonality) maintained?\\n    *   For network/graph data, are graph properties (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, path length, community structure) preserved?\\n    *   **Factorization Aspect:** If factorization is used (e.g., PCA, NMF), how effectively does it capture the latent structure and variance of the data? What is the reconstruction error? Does the factorization inherently preserve or lose certain types of relationships?\\n    *   **Random Graph Generation Aspect:** If a random graph models dependencies, how well does the generated graph reflect the true dependency structure? Is it merely a static model, or does it capture dynamic relationships?\\n\\n3.  **Feature Types Handling:**\\n    *   How are mixed data types (numerical, categorical, ordinal, mixed-scale) handled consistently and accurately?\\n    *   Are rare categories or outliers preserved sufficiently, or are they smoothed out excessively by the privacy mechanism?\\n\\n4.  **Downstream Utility:**\\n    *   Can machine learning models (e.g., classifiers, regressors) trained on synthetic data achieve comparable performance to those trained on real data for specific tasks? (This is often the most important metric for validity).\\n    *   Can aggregate queries run on synthetic data yield results similar to those on real data?\\n    *   Are the conclusions drawn from statistical analyses (e.g., hypothesis testing, regression coefficients) similar for both real and synthetic data?\\n\\n5.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision and Recall of relationships, FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy), R-squared for regression, F1-score/AUC for classification, statistical significance tests on parameters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **II. Differential Privacy (DP) Guarantees**\\n\\nThis section evaluates the strength and correctness of the privacy protection.\\n\\n1.  **DP Definition & Parameters:**\\n    *   Is the chosen DP definition (e.g., $(\\\\epsilon, \\\\delta)$-DP, pure $\\\\epsilon$-DP, R\u00e9nyi DP) clearly stated and justified?\\n    *   Are the $\\\\epsilon$ and $\\\\delta$ values appropriate for the target use case and privacy risk? What is the rationale for these choices? (Smaller $\\\\epsilon$ means stronger privacy, often at the cost of utility).\\n\\n2.  **Privacy Mechanism Application:**\\n    *   **General:** At what granular level is privacy applied (e.g., per row, per attribute, per aggregate)? Is this appropriate for the threat model?\\n    *   **Factorization:** If DP is applied during factorization (e.g., privatizing gradients in a DP-SGD based factorization, or privatizing the resulting factors directly), how is sensitivity calculated for these operations? Does the privatization significantly degrade the quality of the factors?\\n    *   **Random Graph Generation:** If the graph generation parameters are learned from private data, how are these parameters privatized? For example, if generating a graph based on private degree distributions, how is noise added to these counts?\\n    *   **Noise Distribution:** Is the chosen noise distribution (Laplace, Gaussian, etc.) appropriate for the sensitivity of the operation?\\n    *   **Sensitivity Calculation:** Are the sensitivities of all functions/queries correctly and rigorously calculated? This is fundamental for correct DP guarantees.\\n\\n3.  **Composition:**\\n    *   If multiple DP mechanisms are applied sequentially or in parallel (e.g., privatizing marginals, then applying a factorization step), how is the total privacy budget ($\\\\epsilon_{total}, \\\\delta_{total}$) accounted for using composition theorems? Is this calculation sound?\\n\\n4.  **Proof of DP:**\\n    *   Is there a clear proof sketch or a reference to a formal proof for the DP guarantee of the entire methodology? This is crucial for verifying the claims.\\n\\n5.  **Trade-offs:**\\n    *   How does varying $\\\\epsilon$ (and $\\\\delta$) impact the utility of the synthetic data? Is this relationship quantified?\\n\\n6.  **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks:**\\n    *   Is the methodology resistant to known DP-related attacks (e.g., reconstruction attacks, membership inference attacks) given its $\\\\epsilon, \\\\delta$ parameters?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **III. Overall Validity & Robustness**\\n\\nThis section assesses the practical applicability, reliability, and limitations of the methodology.\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Reproducibility:**\\n    *   Is the methodology clearly described, allowing others to understand and reproduce the results?\\n    *   Are the hyper-parameters and their selection criteria well-documented?\\n\\n2.  **Scalability:**\\n    *   Does the method scale efficiently with increasing data size (number of rows, number of features)? What are the computational complexity and memory requirements?\\n\\n3.  **Robustness to Data Characteristics:**\\n    *   How does the method handle missing values, noisy data, or highly skewed distributions in the real data?\\n    *   Does it gracefully handle schema changes or new data arrivals (if applicable for iterative use)?\\n\\n4.  **Assumptions and Limitations:**\\n    *   What are the underlying assumptions about the data (e.g., independence, specific distributions)? Are these assumptions clearly stated and justified?\\n    *   What are the known limitations of the approach? (e.g., struggles with very high-dimensional data, specific types of correlations, or extreme privacy settings).\\n\\n5.  **Computational Cost:**\\n    *   Is the generation process computationally feasible for typical dataset sizes?\\n\\n6.  **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:**\\n    *   How does the proposed methodology compare to existing synthetic data generation techniques (especially DP-enabled ones) in terms of utility, privacy, and computational efficiency?\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy addressing these points comprehensively, you can construct a strong case for the rigor, privacy guarantees, and validity of your synthetic data generation methodology.

The specific effectiveness would heavily depend on the actual algorithm, architecture, and training process of the (unspecified) proposed method.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Assessment of Synthetic Data Generation for Many-to-Many Relationships (with MOVIELENS Case Study)\\n\\nMany-to-many relationships are a cornerstone of real-world relational databases, representing complex interactions between entities (e.g., Users and Movies, Products and Orders, Students and Courses). Generating realistic synthetic data for such structures is significantly more challenging than for single-table datasets.\\n\\n### Understanding Many-to-Many Relationships in Relational Data\\n\\nIn relational databases, M2M relationships are typically implemented using a \\\"junction\\\" or \\\"linking\\\" table that contains foreign keys to the two (or more) primary tables, along with any attributes specific to the relationship itself.\\n\\n**Example: MOVIELENS Dataset**\\n\\nThe MOVIELENS dataset perfectly illustrates M2M relationships:\\n\\n*   **`users` table:** `UserID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Occupation`, `ZipCode`\\n*   **`movies` table:** `MovieID`, `Title`, `Genres`\\n*   **`ratings` table (junction table):** `UserID`, `MovieID`, `Rating`, `Timestamp`\\n\\nHere, a user can rate many movies, and a movie can be rated by many users. The `ratings` table captures this M2M relationship, along with associated attributes (`Rating`, `Timestamp`).\\n\\n**Key Challenges for SDG with M2M:**\\n\\n1.  **Referential Integrity:** Synthetic `UserID`s in the `ratings` table must exist in the synthetic `users` table. Synthetic `MovieID`s in `ratings` must exist in `movies`. Failure to maintain this renders the data unusable.\\n2.  **Sparsity:** M2M relationship tables (like `ratings`) are often very sparse. Not every user rates every movie. The distribution of connections (e.g., some users rate few movies, some rate many; some movies are rated frequently, some rarely) is critical.\\n3.  **Complex Inter-Table Dependencies:**\\n    *   **User-Rating-Movie:** Certain user demographics (age, gender, occupation) might correlate with preferences for specific movie genres or high/low ratings.\\n    *   **Temporal Patterns:** The `Timestamp` in `ratings` indicates when a rating occurred. This can reflect trends, movie popularity over time, or user activity patterns.\\n    *   **Intra-Relationship Attributes:** The `Rating` itself is a crucial attribute of the relationship, dependent on both the user and the movie, and potentially other factors like the user's past ratings or the movie's overall popularity.\\n4.  **Attribute Value Ranges/Distributions:** Ensuring that generated ratings are within a valid range (e.g., 1-5 stars) and that their distribution matches the original (e.g., more 4-star ratings than 1-star) is essential.\\n\\n### General Approaches and Their Applicability to M2M\\n\\nDifferent categories of SDG methods approach M2M relationships with varying degrees of success:\\n\\n1.  **Independent Table-by-Table Generation (e.g., basic statistical models, simple rule-based generation):**\\n    *   **Applicability:** **Extremely Poor.** These methods would generate `users`, `movies`, and `ratings` tables independently. This would almost certainly break referential integrity (synthetic `ratings` would link to non-existent users/movies). They cannot capture inter-table dependencies.\\n    *   **Utility/Realism:** Data would be largely useless and unrealistic for analysis requiring relational integrity.\\n\\n2.  **Flattened/Joined Table Generation (e.g., tabular GANs like CTGAN, VAEs, or some diffusion models applied to a wide table):**\\n    *   **Applicability:** **Challenging but Possible.** This approach involves joining the tables into a single, wide denormalized table before generation.\\n        *   **Pros:** Can theoretically capture complex, non-linear dependencies *if* the model is powerful enough.\\n        *   **Cons:**\\n            *   **Referential Integrity:** Still a major hurdle. If a model generates a `ratings` row, it might generate a `UserID` that doesn't exist in the \\\"true\\\" `users` table, or a `MovieID` not in \\\"true\\\" `movies`. Post-processing (e.g., mapping to nearest real IDs, or generating IDs separately and then linking) is often required, which can degrade realism.\\n            *   **Sparsity & Dimensionality:** Flattening M2M data leads to extremely wide and sparse tables (e.g., for each user-movie pair, a rating might exist or not). Generative models can struggle with high dimensionality and the inherent sparsity of this representation.\\n            *   **Data Leakage/Privacy:** Joining sensitive data into one table might increase privacy risks if not handled carefully with differential privacy mechanisms.\\n    *   **Utility/Realism:** Can capture some dependencies, but maintaining referential integrity and handling sparsity are critical challenges that often lead to compromises in realism or utility.\\n\\n3.  **Relational/Graph-Aware Generation (e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for generating links, specific models for relational databases, or iterative generation focusing on dependencies):**\\n    *   **Applicability:** **Most Promising.** These methods are explicitly designed to understand and model relationships within structured data.\\n        *   **Approach examples:**\\n            *   Generate entity tables (`users`, `movies`) first.\\n            *   Then, using learned embeddings or models that condition on existing entities, generate the links in the junction table (`ratings`), ensuring referential integrity by design.\\n            *   Attributes of the links (e.g., `Rating`, `Timestamp`) are generated conditioned on the linked entities.\\n            *   Some advanced models might use GNNs to model the entire knowledge graph of entities and relations.\\n        *   **Pros:** By explicitly modeling the relationships, these methods have the best chance of preserving referential integrity and capturing the complex inter-table dependencies and conditional distributions (e.g., the probability of a user rating a movie, and what that rating would be).\\n        *   **Cons:** More complex to design, implement, and train. Often require specialized architectures and significant computational resources. Fewer off-the-shelf solutions compared to tabular GANs.\\n    *   **Utility/Realism:** Highest potential for generating highly realistic and useful synthetic data that accurately reflects the original data's relational structure and statistical properties.\\n\\n### Capturing Complex Dependencies and Generating Realistic Data (MOVIELENS Case Study)\\n\\nFor MOVIELENS, a successful method must:\\n\\n1.  **Generate `users` and `movies` with realistic internal distributions:**\\n    *   `users`: Age, gender, occupation distributions.\\n    *   `movies`: Genre distributions, title formats (though titles are often pseudonymized or not generated directly).\\n2.  **Generate `ratings` that maintain referential integrity:** Every generated `UserID` and `MovieID` in `ratings` must link to a valid synthetic user and movie.\\n3.  **Capture User-Movie-Rating Dependencies:**\\n    *   **Who rates what:** Does the synthetic data reflect that younger users might rate certain genres more, or that specific occupations prefer niche films?\\n    *   **How much they rate:** Is the distribution of ratings per user and ratings per movie preserved? (e.g., active users vs. casual users, popular movies vs. obscure ones).\\n    *   **What rating:** Does the distribution of 1-5 star ratings for different user-movie pairs make sense? (e.g., a horror fan's rating for a horror movie vs. a drama fan's).\\n    *   **Temporal patterns:** Are the timestamps realistic, showing activity peaks, or consistent over time? Could the synthetic data be used to analyze rating trends?\\n    *   **Sparsity:** Crucially, the synthetic `ratings` table should exhibit similar sparsity patterns to the original. Randomly generating ratings for *all* user-movie pairs would be completely unrealistic.\\n\\nOnly **Relational/Graph-Aware Generation** approaches stand a good chance of robustly capturing these dependencies. A flattened approach might capture some correlations but struggles with the structural constraints and sparsity.\\n\\n### Preserving Utility of the Original Data\\n\\nThe utility of synthetic M2M data, particularly for MOVIELENS, is assessed by its ability to substitute the original data for analytical tasks without significant loss of insight. This includes:\\n\\n*   **Recommendation Systems:** Can a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, matrix factorization) trained on synthetic MOVIELENS data perform similarly to one trained on the original data? This implies preserving underlying user preferences, movie characteristics, and rating patterns.\\n*   **Demographic Analysis:** Can analysts still understand user segments (e.g., \\\"college-aged males who like sci-fi\\\") and their movie preferences using the synthetic data?\\n*   **Trend Analysis:** If the timestamp is included, can temporal trends in movie popularity or user activity be accurately reproduced?\\n*   **Statistical Properties:** Does the synthetic data preserve key statistics like:\\n    *   Average rating per user/movie.\\n    *   Variance of ratings.\\n    *   Distribution of user activity (number of ratings).\\n    *   Distribution of movie popularity (number of ratings received).\\n    *   Correlation between user demographics and movie genres/ratings.\\n\\nFor high utility, the synthetic data needs to be not just realistic in individual columns but also preserve the *relationships and interactions* between columns and across tables.\\n\\n### Scalability\\n\\nThe scalability of \\\"the proposed method\\\" depends entirely on its underlying paradigm:\\n\\n*   **MOVIELENS 1M (1 million ratings):** This is a relatively small dataset. Most modern generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) would likely be trainable, especially on a single GPU.\\n*   **MOVIELENS 25M (25 million ratings) or larger real-world datasets (billions of rows, hundreds of tables):**\\n    *   **Flattened Approaches:** Become very challenging. The resulting wide table would have enormous dimensionality and extreme sparsity, potentially exceeding memory limits and causing training instabilities (e.g., mode collapse due to sparse features).\\n    *   **Relational/Graph-Aware Approaches:** While more principled, they also face scalability hurdles.\\n        *   **Memory:** Representing large graphs or maintaining embeddings for millions of entities can be memory-intensive.\\n        *   **Computational Cost:** Graph operations (e.g., message passing in GNNs) can be computationally expensive for very large graphs. Distributed training might be necessary.\\n        *   **Complexity:** Managing dependencies across hundreds of tables and billions of rows requires sophisticated data pipelining and model architectures.\\n    *   **Incremental/Modular Generation:** A common strategy for large databases is to generate data table by table or in modules, focusing on capturing the most critical dependencies, potentially sacrificing some global consistency for scalability. This requires careful design to ensure cross-table integrity.\\n\\n### Potential Limitations in Practical Scenarios\\n\\n1.  **Complexity of Model Design and Training:** Especially for relational/graph-aware methods, designing and fine-tuning the model for optimal performance on M2M data is non-trivial and requires significant expertise.\\n2.  **Computational Resources:** Training complex generative models on large relational datasets demands substantial compute power (GPUs, memory).\\n3.  **Evaluation Challenges:** Quantifying the \\\"realism\\\" and \\\"utility\\\" of synthetic M2M data is complex. Simple aggregate statistics are insufficient; downstream task performance (e.g., recommendation accuracy) is a better but more resource-intensive metric.\\n4.  **Privacy vs. Utility Trade-off:** More realistic data often implies less privacy. Ensuring differential privacy or other privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility for complex relational data is an active research area.\\n5.  **Mode Collapse/Lack of Diversity:** Generative models can suffer from mode collapse, failing to generate rare but important M2M patterns or types of users/movies.\\n6.  **\\\"New\\\" Entities:** If the goal is to generate truly novel entities (users or movies not seen in the original data), and then link them realistically, the complexity increases significantly.\\n7.  **Schema Evolution:** Real-world schemas evolve. A method highly specialized for one schema might not generalize well to changes.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nFor real-world datasets with many-to-many relationships like MOVIELENS, simple \\\"table-by-table\\\" or naive \\\"flattened table\\\" synthetic data generation methods are largely inadequate. They fail to preserve crucial referential integrity and complex inter-table dependencies, leading to unrealistic and low-utility data.\\n\\n**The most promising category of methods for M2M is **Relational/Graph-Aware Generation**. If \\\"the proposed method\\\" falls into this category, it has the best chance of capturing the nuanced dependencies in MOVIELENS (user demographics to genre preferences, rating distributions, temporal patterns) and generating synthetic data that preserves the original data's utility for tasks like building recommendation systems.\\n\\nHowever, even these advanced methods face significant challenges related to:\\n*   **Scalability** for very large datasets.\\n*   **Computational cost** of training.\\n*   **Complexity** of model design and evaluation.\\n*   The ever-present **privacy-utility trade-off**.\\n\\nA thorough assessment of \\\"the proposed method\\\" would require understanding its specific architecture and how it explicitly handles referential integrity, sparsity, and conditional generation of attributes across multiple linked tables.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.36640185\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Assess the applicability of the proposed method to real-world datasets with many-to-many relationships.

Statistical Rigor**\\n\\nThis section assesses how well the synthetic data preserves the statistical properties of the real data.\\n\\n1.  **Univariate Distributions:**\\n    *   How accurately do the marginal distributions of individual features in the synthetic data match those in the real data? (e.g., mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis for numerical; frequency counts for categorical).\\n    *   **Evaluation Metrics:** KL-Divergence, JS-Divergence, Earth Mover\\'s Distance (EMD), statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for continuous, Chi-squared for categorical).\\n\\n2.  **Multivariate Relationships (Correlations & Dependencies):**\\n    *   How well are pairwise correlations (Pearson, Spearman) preserved?\\n    *   Can the method capture higher-order dependencies (e.g., conditional distributions, non-linear relationships)?\\n    *   For sequence/time-series data, are temporal dependencies (autocorrelation, trends, seasonality) maintained?\\n    *   For network/graph data, are graph properties (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, path length, community structure) preserved?\\n    *   **Factorization Aspect:** If factorization is used (e.g., PCA, NMF), how effectively does it capture the latent structure and variance of the data? What is the reconstruction error? Does the factorization inherently preserve or lose certain types of relationships?\\n    *   **Random Graph Generation Aspect:** If a random graph models dependencies, how well does the generated graph reflect the true dependency structure? Is it merely a static model, or does it capture dynamic relationships?\\n\\n3.  **Feature Types Handling:**\\n    *   How are mixed data types (numerical, categorical, ordinal, mixed-scale) handled consistently and accurately?\\n    *   Are rare categories or outliers preserved sufficiently, or are they smoothed out excessively by the privacy mechanism?\\n\\n4.  **Downstream Utility:**\\n    *   Can machine learning models (e.g., classifiers, regressors) trained on synthetic data achieve comparable performance to those trained on real data for specific tasks? (This is often the most important metric for validity).\\n    *   Can aggregate queries run on synthetic data yield results similar to those on real data?\\n    *   Are the conclusions drawn from statistical analyses (e.g., hypothesis testing, regression coefficients) similar for both real and synthetic data?\\n\\n5.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision and Recall of relationships, FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy), R-squared for regression, F1-score/AUC for classification, statistical significance tests on parameters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **II. Differential Privacy (DP) Guarantees**\\n\\nThis section evaluates the strength and correctness of the privacy protection.\\n\\n1.  **DP Definition & Parameters:**\\n    *   Is the chosen DP definition (e.g., $(\\\\epsilon, \\\\delta)$-DP, pure $\\\\epsilon$-DP, R\u00e9nyi DP) clearly stated and justified?\\n    *   Are the $\\\\epsilon$ and $\\\\delta$ values appropriate for the target use case and privacy risk? What is the rationale for these choices? (Smaller $\\\\epsilon$ means stronger privacy, often at the cost of utility).\\n\\n2.  **Privacy Mechanism Application:**\\n    *   **General:** At what granular level is privacy applied (e.g., per row, per attribute, per aggregate)? Is this appropriate for the threat model?\\n    *   **Factorization:** If DP is applied during factorization (e.g., privatizing gradients in a DP-SGD based factorization, or privatizing the resulting factors directly), how is sensitivity calculated for these operations? Does the privatization significantly degrade the quality of the factors?\\n    *   **Random Graph Generation:** If the graph generation parameters are learned from private data, how are these parameters privatized? For example, if generating a graph based on private degree distributions, how is noise added to these counts?\\n    *   **Noise Distribution:** Is the chosen noise distribution (Laplace, Gaussian, etc.) appropriate for the sensitivity of the operation?\\n    *   **Sensitivity Calculation:** Are the sensitivities of all functions/queries correctly and rigorously calculated? This is fundamental for correct DP guarantees.\\n\\n3.  **Composition:**\\n    *   If multiple DP mechanisms are applied sequentially or in parallel (e.g., privatizing marginals, then applying a factorization step), how is the total privacy budget ($\\\\epsilon_{total}, \\\\delta_{total}$) accounted for using composition theorems? Is this calculation sound?\\n\\n4.  **Proof of DP:**\\n    *   Is there a clear proof sketch or a reference to a formal proof for the DP guarantee of the entire methodology?

Overall Validity & Robustness**\\n\\nThis section assesses the practical applicability, reliability, and limitations of the methodology.\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Reproducibility:**\\n    *   Is the methodology clearly described, allowing others to understand and reproduce the results?\\n    *   Are the hyper-parameters and their selection criteria well-documented?\\n\\n2.  **Scalability:**\\n    *   Does the method scale efficiently with increasing data size (number of rows, number of features)? What are the computational complexity and memory requirements?\\n\\n3.  **Robustness to Data Characteristics:**\\n    *   How does the method handle missing values, noisy data, or highly skewed distributions in the real data?\\n    *   Does it gracefully handle schema changes or new data arrivals (if applicable for iterative use)?\\n\\n4.  **Assumptions and Limitations:**\\n    *   What are the underlying assumptions about the data (e.g., independence, specific distributions)? Are these assumptions clearly stated and justified?\\n    *   What are the known limitations of the approach?

The specific effectiveness would heavily depend on the actual algorithm, architecture, and training process of the (unspecified) proposed method.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Assessment of Synthetic Data Generation for Many-to-Many Relationships (with MOVIELENS Case Study)\\n\\nMany-to-many relationships are a cornerstone of real-world relational databases, representing complex interactions between entities (e.g., Users and Movies, Products and Orders, Students and Courses). Generating realistic synthetic data for such structures is significantly more challenging than for single-table datasets.\\n\\n### Understanding Many-to-Many Relationships in Relational Data\\n\\nIn relational databases, M2M relationships are typically implemented using a \"junction\" or \"linking\" table that contains foreign keys to the two (or more) primary tables, along with any attributes specific to the relationship itself.\\n\\n**Example: MOVIELENS Dataset**\\n\\nThe MOVIELENS dataset perfectly illustrates M2M relationships:\\n\\n*   **`users` table:** `UserID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Occupation`, `ZipCode`\\n*   **`movies` table:** `MovieID`, `Title`, `Genres`\\n*   **`ratings` table (junction table):** `UserID`, `MovieID`, `Rating`, `Timestamp`\\n\\nHere, a user can rate many movies, and a movie can be rated by many users. The `ratings` table captures this M2M relationship, along with associated attributes (`Rating`, `Timestamp`).\\n\\n**Key Challenges for SDG with M2M:**\\n\\n1.  **Referential Integrity:** Synthetic `UserID`s in the `ratings` table must exist in the synthetic `users` table. Synthetic `MovieID`s in `ratings` must exist in `movies`. Failure to maintain this renders the data unusable.\\n2.  **Sparsity:** M2M relationship tables (like `ratings`) are often very sparse. Not every user rates every movie. The distribution of connections (e.g., some users rate few movies, some rate many; some movies are rated frequently, some rarely) is critical.\\n3.  **Complex Inter-Table Dependencies:**\\n    *   **User-Rating-Movie:** Certain user demographics (age, gender, occupation) might correlate with preferences for specific movie genres or high/low ratings.\\n    *   **Temporal Patterns:** The `Timestamp` in `ratings` indicates when a rating occurred. This can reflect trends, movie popularity over time, or user activity patterns.\\n    *   **Intra-Relationship Attributes:** The `Rating` itself is a crucial attribute of the relationship, dependent on both the user and the movie, and potentially other factors like the user\\'s past ratings or the movie\\'s overall popularity.\\n4.  **Attribute Value Ranges/Distributions:** Ensuring that generated ratings are within a valid range (e.g., 1-5 stars) and that their distribution matches the original (e.g., more 4-star ratings than 1-star) is essential.\\n\\n### General Approaches and Their Applicability to M2M\\n\\nDifferent categories of SDG methods approach M2M relationships with varying degrees of success:\\n\\n1.  **Independent Table-by-Table Generation (e.g., basic statistical models, simple rule-based generation):**\\n    *   **Applicability:** **Extremely Poor.** These methods would generate `users`, `movies`, and `ratings` tables independently. This would almost certainly break referential integrity (synthetic `ratings` would link to non-existent users/movies). They cannot capture inter-table dependencies.\\n    *   **Utility/Realism:** Data would be largely useless and unrealistic for analysis requiring relational integrity.\\n\\n2.  **Flattened/Joined Table Generation (e.g., tabular GANs like CTGAN, VAEs, or some diffusion models applied to a wide table):**\\n    *   **Applicability:** **Challenging but Possible.** This approach involves joining the tables into a single, wide denormalized table before generation.\\n        *   **Pros:** Can theoretically capture complex, non-linear dependencies *if* the model is powerful enough.\\n        *   **Cons:**\\n            *   **Referential Integrity:** Still a major hurdle. If a model generates a `ratings` row, it might generate a `UserID` that doesn\\'t exist in the \"true\" `users` table, or a `MovieID` not in \"true\" `movies`. Post-processing (e.g., mapping to nearest real IDs, or generating IDs separately and then linking) is often required, which can degrade realism.\\n            *   **Sparsity & Dimensionality:** Flattening M2M data leads to extremely wide and sparse tables (e.g., for each user-movie pair, a rating might exist or not). Generative models can struggle with high dimensionality and the inherent sparsity of this representation.\\n            *   **Data Leakage/Privacy:** Joining sensitive data into one table might increase privacy risks if not handled carefully with differential privacy mechanisms.\\n    *   **Utility/Realism:** Can capture some dependencies, but maintaining referential integrity and handling sparsity are critical challenges that often lead to compromises in realism or utility.\\n\\n3.  **Relational/Graph-Aware Generation (e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for generating links, specific models for relational databases, or iterative generation focusing on dependencies):**\\n    *   **Applicability:** **Most Promising.** These methods are explicitly designed to understand and model relationships within structured data.\\n        *   **Approach examples:**\\n            *   Generate entity tables (`users`, `movies`) first.\\n            *   Then, using learned embeddings or models that condition on existing entities, generate the links in the junction table (`ratings`), ensuring referential integrity by design.\\n            *   Attributes of the links (e.g., `Rating`, `Timestamp`) are generated conditioned on the linked entities.\\n            *   Some advanced models might use GNNs to model the entire knowledge graph of entities and relations.\\n        *   **Pros:** By explicitly modeling the relationships, these methods have the best chance of preserving referential integrity and capturing the complex inter-table dependencies and conditional distributions (e.g., the probability of a user rating a movie, and what that rating would be).\\n        *   **Cons:** More complex to design, implement, and train. Often require specialized architectures and significant computational resources. Fewer off-the-shelf solutions compared to tabular GANs.\\n    *   **Utility/Realism:** Highest potential for generating highly realistic and useful synthetic data that accurately reflects the original data\\'s relational structure and statistical properties.\\n\\n### Capturing Complex Dependencies and Generating Realistic Data (MOVIELENS Case Study)\\n\\nFor MOVIELENS, a successful method must:\\n\\n1.  **Generate `users` and `movies` with realistic internal distributions:**\\n    *   `users`: Age, gender, occupation distributions.\\n    *   `movies`: Genre distributions, title formats (though titles are often pseudonymized or not generated directly).\\n2.  **Generate `ratings` that maintain referential integrity:** Every generated `UserID` and `MovieID` in `ratings` must link to a valid synthetic user and movie.\\n3.  **Capture User-Movie-Rating Dependencies:**\\n    *   **Who rates what:** Does the synthetic data reflect that younger users might rate certain genres more, or that specific occupations prefer niche films?\\n    *   **How much they rate:** Is the distribution of ratings per user and ratings per movie preserved? (e.g., active users vs. casual users, popular movies vs. obscure ones).\\n    *   **What rating:** Does the distribution of 1-5 star ratings for different user-movie pairs make sense? (e.g., a horror fan\\'s rating for a horror movie vs. a drama fan\\'s).\\n    *   **Temporal patterns:** Are the timestamps realistic, showing activity peaks, or consistent over time? Could the synthetic data be used to analyze rating trends?\\n    *   **Sparsity:** Crucially, the synthetic `ratings` table should exhibit similar sparsity patterns to the original. Randomly generating ratings for *all* user-movie pairs would be completely unrealistic.\\n\\nOnly **Relational/Graph-Aware Generation** approaches stand a good chance of robustly capturing these dependencies. A flattened approach might capture some correlations but struggles with the structural constraints and sparsity.\\n\\n### Preserving Utility of the Original Data\\n\\nThe utility of synthetic M2M data, particularly for MOVIELENS, is assessed by its ability to substitute the original data for analytical tasks without significant loss of insight. This includes:\\n\\n*   **Recommendation Systems:** Can a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, matrix factorization) trained on synthetic MOVIELENS data perform similarly to one trained on the original data? This implies preserving underlying user preferences, movie characteristics, and rating patterns.\\n*   **Demographic Analysis:** Can analysts still understand user segments (e.g., \"college-aged males who like sci-fi\") and their movie preferences using the synthetic data?\\n*   **Trend Analysis:** If the timestamp is included, can temporal trends in movie popularity or user activity be accurately reproduced?\\n*   **Statistical Properties:** Does the synthetic data preserve key statistics like:\\n    *   Average rating per user/movie.\\n    *   Variance of ratings.\\n    *   Distribution of user activity (number of ratings).\\n    *   Distribution of movie popularity (number of ratings received).\\n    *   Correlation between user demographics and movie genres/ratings.\\n\\nFor high utility, the synthetic data needs to be not just realistic in individual columns but also preserve the *relationships and interactions* between columns and across tables.\\n\\n### Scalability\\n\\nThe scalability of \"the proposed method\" depends entirely on its underlying paradigm:\\n\\n*   **MOVIELENS 1M (1 million ratings):** This is a relatively small dataset. Most modern generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) would likely be trainable, especially on a single GPU.\\n*   **MOVIELENS 25M (25 million ratings) or larger real-world datasets (billions of rows, hundreds of tables):**\\n    *   **Flattened Approaches:** Become very challenging. The resulting wide table would have enormous dimensionality and extreme sparsity, potentially exceeding memory limits and causing training instabilities (e.g., mode collapse due to sparse features).\\n    *   **Relational/Graph-Aware Approaches:** While more principled, they also face scalability hurdles.\\n        *   **Memory:** Representing large graphs or maintaining embeddings for millions of entities can be memory-intensive.\\n        *   **Computational Cost:** Graph operations (e.g., message passing in GNNs) can be computationally expensive for very large graphs. Distributed training might be necessary.\\n        *   **Complexity:** Managing dependencies across hundreds of tables and billions of rows requires sophisticated data pipelining and model architectures.\\n    *   **Incremental/Modular Generation:** A common strategy for large databases is to generate data table by table or in modules, focusing on capturing the most critical dependencies, potentially sacrificing some global consistency for scalability. This requires careful design to ensure cross-table integrity.\\n\\n### Potential Limitations in Practical Scenarios\\n\\n1.  **Complexity of Model Design and Training:** Especially for relational/graph-aware methods, designing and fine-tuning the model for optimal performance on M2M data is non-trivial and requires significant expertise.\\n2.  **Computational Resources:** Training complex generative models on large relational datasets demands substantial compute power (GPUs, memory).\\n3.  **Evaluation Challenges:** Quantifying the \"realism\" and \"utility\" of synthetic M2M data is complex. Simple aggregate statistics are insufficient; downstream task performance (e.g., recommendation accuracy) is a better but more resource-intensive metric.\\n4.  **Privacy vs. Utility Trade-off:** More realistic data often implies less privacy. Ensuring differential privacy or other privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility for complex relational data is an active research area.\\n5.  **Mode Collapse/Lack of Diversity:** Generative models can suffer from mode collapse, failing to generate rare but important M2M patterns or types of users/movies.\\n6.  **\"New\" Entities:** If the goal is to generate truly novel entities (users or movies not seen in the original data), and then link them realistically, the complexity increases significantly.\\n7.  **Schema Evolution:** Real-world schemas evolve. A method highly specialized for one schema might not generalize well to changes.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nFor real-world datasets with many-to-many relationships like MOVIELENS, simple \"table-by-table\" or naive \"flattened table\" synthetic data generation methods are largely inadequate. They fail to preserve crucial referential integrity and complex inter-table dependencies, leading to unrealistic and low-utility data.\\n\\n**The most promising category of methods for M2M is **Relational/Graph-Aware Generation**. If \"the proposed method\" falls into this category, it has the best chance of capturing the nuanced dependencies in MOVIELENS (user demographics to genre preferences, rating distributions, temporal patterns) and generating synthetic data that preserves the original data\\'s utility for tasks like building recommendation systems.\\n\\nHowever, even these advanced methods face significant challenges related to:\\n*   **Scalability** for very large datasets.\\n*   **Computational cost** of training.\\n*   **Complexity** of model design and evaluation.\\n*   The ever-present **privacy-utility trade-off**.\\n\\nA thorough assessment of \"the proposed method\" would require understanding its specific architecture and how it explicitly handles referential integrity, sparsity, and conditional generation of attributes across multiple linked tables.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.36640185}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'To provide the most effective evaluation, I would ideally need to review the specific research paper itself.
