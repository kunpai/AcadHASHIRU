The paper title is: FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly: The Power of Overparameterized Multi-Layer Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients collaborate with the help of a server to learn a joint model McMahan et al. (2017). The privacy guarantees of FL has made it a popular distributed learning paradigm, as each client holds a private data set and aims to learn a global model without leaking its data to other nodes or the server. The performance of FL algorithms is known to degrade when training data at individual nodes originates from different distributions, referred to as the heterogeneous data setting Yu et al. (2019a); Woodworth et al. (2020a). In the past few years, a substantial research effort has been devoted towards developing a large number of algorithms that can better deal with data heterogeneity, Karimireddy et al. (2020b); Zhang et al. (2021); Li et al. (2018); Acar et al. (2020); Khanduri et al. (2021). However, in practice it has been observed by a number of recent works, that in spite of the data heterogeneity, the simple vanilla FedAvg algorithm (a.k.a. the Local SGD) still offers competitive performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art. For example, see Table 2 in Karimireddy et al. (2020a), Table 1 in Reddi et al. (2020), and Table 2 in Yang et al. (2021) for performance comparison of FedAvg on popular FL tasks. Motivated by these observations, we ask: Is it possible to handle the the data heterogeneity issue from a different perspective, without modifying the vanilla FedAvg algorithm? To answer this question, in this work we show that FedAvg can indeed perform very well regardless of the heterogeneity conditions, if the models to be learned are nice enough. Specifically, FedAvg finds solutions that achieve almost zero training loss (or almost global optimal solution) very quickly (i.e., linearly), when the FL model to be trained is certain overparameterized multi-layer neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that shows (linear) convergence of FedAvg in the overparameterized regime for training multilayer neural networks. The major contributions of our work are listed below. \u2022 Under certain assumptions on the neural network architecture, we prove some key properties of the clients\u2019 (stochastic) gradients during the training phase (Lemmas 1 and 2). These results allow us to establish convergence of FedAvg for training overparameterized neural networks without imposing restrictive heterogeneity assumptions on the gradients of the local loss functions. \u2022 We design a special initialization strategy for training the network using FedAvg. The initialization is designed such that the singular values of the model parameters and the outputs of the first layer of local and aggregated model parameters stay positive definite during the training. This property combined with overparameterization enables FedAvg to converge linearly to a (near) optimal solution. \u2022 We conduct experiments on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets in both i.i.d. and heterogeneous data settings to compare the performance of FedAvg on various network architectures of different sizes. To our knowledge, this is the first work that shows the linear convergence of FedAvg (both SGD and GD versions) to the optimal solution when training a overparameterized multi-layer neural networks. Related Work: Federated Learning (FL). FL algorithms were first proposed in McMahan et al. (2017), where within each communication round the clients utilize their private data to update the model parameters using multiple SGD steps. Earlier works analyzed the performance of FedAvg for the case of homogeneous data setting Zhou and Cong (2018); Stich (2018); Lin et al. (2020); Woodworth et al. (2020b); Wang and Joshi (2021), i.e., when the local data at each client follows the same underlying distribution. Motivated by practical applications, recent works have analyzed FedAvg for heterogeneous client data distributions Yu et al. (2019b;a); Haddadpour and Mahdavi (2019); Woodworth et al. (2020a) and it was observed that the performance of FedAvg degrades as the data heterogeneity increases. To address the data heterogeneity issue among clients, many works have focused on developing sophisticated algorithms Karimireddy et al. (2020b); Zhang et al. (2021); Acar et al. (2020); Li et al. (2018); Khanduri et al. (2021); Karimireddy et al. (2020a); Das et al. (2020). Overparameterized Neural Networks. The surprising performance of overparameterized neural networks1 has raised significant research interest in the ML community to analyze the phenomenon of overparameterization Belkin et al. (2019). Consequently, many works have analyzed the performance of centralized (stochastic) gradient descent (S)GD on overparameterized neural network architectures under different settings Jacot et al. (2018); Li and Liang (2018); Arora et al. (2019); Du et al. (2018; 2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Zou and Gu (2019); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020); Nguyen (2021). However, there are only a handful of works that have attempted to analyze the performance of overparameterized neural networks in the distributed setting Li et al. (2021); Huang et al. (2021); Deng and Mahdavi (2021). The works most closely related to our work are Huang et al. (2021) and Deng and Mahdavi (2021). Huang et al. (2021) analyzed the performance of FedAvg on a single hidden-layer neural network for the case when each client utilizes GD for the local updates. The authors established linear convergence of FedAvg using the NTK parameterization and showed that it suffices to design the neural network of width \u2126(N4) to achieve this performance (where N is the number of training samples). Similarly, Deng and Mahdavi (2021) analyzed the performance of FedAvg on a ReLU neural network but when each client utilizes SGD (or GD) for the local updates. The authors proved convergence of FedAvg under the standard parameterization while requiring the very large network width of \u2126(N18). Note that since individual clients can be devices with limited computational capabilities, in realistic settings it is undesirable to have networks of such large widths. In contrast to both these works, we focus on the more practical setting of a multi-layer neural network Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) and establish linear convergence of FedAvg even for the case when each client utilizes SGD for the local updates. Importantly, we show that with proper initialization, it only requires a network of width N at each client, which is much smaller compared to the unrealistic requirements of Huang et al. (2021); Deng and Mahdavi (2021). 2 PROBLEM SETUP: In this section, we define the multi-layer neural network and formalize the problem we aim to solve. We consider a distributed system of K clients with each client having access to a privately held data set. We assume that each client k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K } has Nk training samples denoted as {(Xk, Yk)}, with Xk \u2208 RNk\u00d7din and Yk \u2208 RNk\u00d7dout . Note that each row of Xk and Yk represents the feature vector and its corresponding label, and din and dout denote the feature (input) and label (output) dimensions, respectively. We further denote N = \u2211K k=1 Nk as the total samples across all clients. 1A model is generally referred to as overparameterized if the number of (trainable) parameters are more than the number of training samples N . Suppose each client trains a fully-connected neural network with L layers, and with activation function \u03c3 : R \u2192 R. We denote the vectorized parameters at each node k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} as \u03b8k = [vec (W1,k) , . . . , vec (WL,k)] \u2208 RD, where Wl,k \u2208 Rnl\u22121\u00d7nl represents the weight matrix of each layer l \u2208 {1, . . . , L} and nl represents the width of each layer. Note that each layer inputs a (feature) vector of dimension nl\u22121 and outputs a (feature) vector of dimension nl. For simplicity, define n0 = din and nL = dout as the input and the output dimensions of the neural network. We define Fl,k as the local output of each layer l at client k, then using the above notations, we have Fl,k =  Xk l = 0 \u03c3 (Fl\u22121,kWl,k) l \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , L} FL\u22121,kWL,k l = L . (1) We further define the vectorized output of each layer and the labels at each client as fl,k = vec(Fl,k) \u2208 RNknl and yk = vec(Yk) \u2208 RNknL . Similar to the above setup, we also define the notations to describe a single network, with the full data (X,Y ) with X \u2208 RN\u00d7din and Y \u2208 RN\u00d7dout as input. This \u201ccentralized\" network will be useful later to perform the analysis. Then given parameter \u03b8 = [vec (W1) , . . . , vec (WL)], the output at each layer of the network is defined as Fl =  X l = 0 \u03c3 (Fl\u22121Wl) l \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , L} FL\u22121WL l = L . (2) Next, we define the local and global loss functions. First, each client k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} has a local loss function given by: \u03a6k(\u03b8) := 12Nk \u2225fL,k(\u03b8)\u2212 yk\u2225 2 2, where \u2225 \u00b7 \u22252 denotes the standard \u21132-norm. Then the global loss function is the sum of weighted local loss functions, given by: \u03a6(\u03b8) := K\u2211 k=1 Nk N \u03a6k(\u03b8) = 1 2N \u2225FL(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u22252F . (3) Additionally, define the gradient of (3) as g := [vec(\u2207W1\u03a6(\u03b8)), . . . , vec(\u2207WL\u03a6(\u03b8))], which is the stacked gradient of the loss w.r.t. the 1st to Lth layer\u2019s parameters; define the gradient of the losses at each client k \u2208 [K] as: gk := [g1,k, . . . , gL,K ] with gl,k := vec(\u2207Wl,k\u03a6(\u03b8)) for all l \u2208 [L]. Next, we define the optimality criteria to solve (3) using an overparameterized neural network. Definition 1 (\u03f5-optimal solution). Consider an overparameterized problem min\u03b8 \u03a6(\u03b8), where there exist \u03b8\u2217 such that \u03a6(\u03b8\u2217) = 0. A solution \u03b8 is called an \u03f5-optimal solution if it satisfies \u03a6(x) \u2264 \u03f5. Moreover, if x is a random variable, then we use E[\u03a6(x)] \u2264 \u03f5 to denote an \u03f5-optimal solution, where the expectation is taken w.r.t. the randomness of x. 3 THE FEDAVG ALGORITHM: A classical algorithm to solve problem (3) is the FedAvg McMahan et al. (2017). In FedAvg, each client performs multiple local updates before sharing their updated parameters with the server. We refer the algorithm as FedAvg-SGD (resp. FedAvg-GD) if the clients employ SGD (resp. GD) for the local updates. The detailed steps to implement FedAvg-SGD are listed in Algorithm 1. We execute the algorithm for a total of T communication rounds, within each communication round every client performs r local updates. In each communication round t the server aggregates the local parameters and constructs \u03b8\u0304rt from each client\u2019s local parameters \u03b8rt+rk and shares it with the clients. The clients use the aggregated parameter, \u03b8\u0304rt+rk , as the initial parameter value for computing the next round of local updates. For each v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1}, to update the local parameters the clients compute the (unbiased) stochastic gradient using m-samples drawn form their private data set (Xk, Yk). We denote the random sample drawn at vth local step in the tth communication round as (X\u0303rt+vk , Y\u0303 rt+v k ). Using the stochastic gradient estimate, the clients update their parameters locally by employing the SGD step. After r local SGD steps, each client shares its updated parameters with the server and gets back the aggregated parameters before starting the next round of updates. Note that if we choose the batch size m = Nk, for all k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}, FedAvg-SGD becomes FedAvg-GD. Algorithm 1 The FedAvg-SGD Algorithm Initialize: Parameters \u03b80k = \u03b80, Step-size \u03b7, # of communication rounds, local updates T , r for t = 0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1 do for each client k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} do Set \u03b8rtk = \u03b8\u0304 rt for v = 0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1 do Sample mini-batch of size m, (X\u0303rt+vk , Y\u0303 rt+v k ) Compute stochastic gradient g\u0303rt+vk using (5) Update: \u03b8rt+v+1k = \u03b8 rt+v k \u2212 \u03b7g\u0303 rt+v k . Aggregation: \u03b8\u0304r(t+1) = K\u2211 k=1 Nk N \u03b8 rt+r k Return: Parameters, \u03b8\u0304rT Algorithm 1 summarizes the above description. For each communication round t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1} and local step v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r\u22121}, we define the vector \u03b8rt+vk := [vec(W rt+v1,k ), . . . , vec(W rt+v L,k )]. For FedAvgSGD, define F\u0303 rt+vl,k and f\u0303 rt+v l,k as the output and the vectorized output of each hidden layer l, respectively, when the input to the client k\u2019s local network is the stochastic (mini-batch) samples (X\u0303rt+vk , Y\u0303 rt+v k ). Using the notation y\u0303rt+vk = vec(Y\u0303 rt+v k ) as the vectorized labels of the stochastic samples at each local step, we define the mini-batch stochastic loss as: \u03a6\u0303k(\u03b8 rt+v k ) := 1 2m \u2225f\u0303rt+vL,k \u2212 y\u0303 rt+v k \u2225 2 2, (4) and the stochastic gradient as g\u0303rt+vk := [g\u0303 rt+v 1,k , . . . , g\u0303 rt+v L,k ], where g\u0303 rt+v l,k is the stochastic gradient w.r.t. the lth layer of the network evaluated at the kth client: g\u0303rt+vl,k := vec ( \u2207Wl,k\u03a6\u0303k(\u03b8 rt+v k ) ) \u2208 Rnl\u22121nl . (5) For each communication round, let us define the aggregated parameters as: \u03b8\u0304rt := [ vec(W\u0304 rt1 ), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vec(W\u0304 rtL ) ] , W\u0304 rtl = K\u2211 k=1 Nk N W rtl,k. (6) For FedAvg-GD, we denote grt+vk := [g rt+v 1,k , . . . , g rt+v L,k ] as the full gradient of k th client\u2019s loss function, where similar to (5) grt+v1,k defines the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. the l th layer\u2019s parameters. Throughout, we make the following standard assumption Ghadimi and Lan (2013). Assumption 1. The stochastic gradients at each client are unbiased, i.e., we have E[g\u0303rt+vk ] = g rt+v k \u2200k \u2208 [K]. Next, we analyze the performance of the FedAvg for an overparameterized neural network. 4 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS: We present the convergence guarantees of FedAvg when training an overparameterized neural network. We first present a set of assumptions on the network architecture, and activation functions. Assumption 2. The width of each hidden layer satisfies: n1 \u2265 N, n2 \u2265 n3 \u2265 . . . \u2265 nL \u2265 1. Assumption 3. The activation function \u03c3(\u00b7) in (1) satisfies the following: 1) \u03c3\u2032(x) \u2208 [\u03b3, 1]; 2) |\u03c3(x)| \u2264 |x|; \u2200 x \u2208 R; 3) \u03c3\u2032 is \u03b2-Lipschitz, with \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b2 > 0. Remark 1. Assumptions 2 and 3 play an important role in our analysis. They help ensure that the local and global loss functions and their (stochastic) gradients are well behaved. Note that Assumption 2 only requires the first layer to be wide while the rest of the layers can be of constant width. Assumption 2 is required to establish a PL like property for the global and local loss functions Nguyen and Hein (2018); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). Assumption 3 is also standard in the analysis of overparameterized neural networks. Similar assumptions on the smoothness of the activation functions have been made in the past Jacot et al. (2018); Du et al. (2019); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020); Huang and Yau (2020) and are utilized to manage the behavior of the gradients of the loss functions. Importantly, note that as demonstrated in Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) activation functions satisfying Assumption 3 can be utilized to uniformly approximate the ReLU function to arbitrary accuracy. Remark 2. We do not impose any assumptions on the distribution of individual clients\u2019 local data sets. In contrast, a majority of works on FL impose restrictive assumptions on the gradients (and/or the Hessians) of each client\u2019s local loss functions to guarantee algorithm convergence Yu et al. (2019b); Li et al. (2018); Yu et al. (2019a); Karimireddy et al. (2020a). Below, we list two most popular heterogeneity assumptions (from Yu et al. (2019a) and Koloskova et al. (2020), respectively): \u2225\u2207\u03a6k(\u03b81)\u2212\u2207\u03a6(\u03b82)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b4, \u2200\u03b81, \u03b82 \u2208 RD, \u2200 k \u2208 [K], for some \u03b4 > 0. (7) 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u2225\u2207\u03a6k(\u03b8)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b41 + \u03b42\u2225\u2207\u03a6(\u03b8)\u2225, \u2200 \u03b8 \u2208 RD, for some \u03b41, \u03b42 > 0. (8) Both conditions impose strong restrictions on the gradients of the local clients, and they do not hold for even simple quadratic loss Khaled et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021). We will see shortly that, our results will indicate that as long as the neural network is large enough, then the local (stochastic) gradients will be well-behaved, thereby eliminating the need to impose any additional assumptions on the data distributions. In the following, we show the convergence guarantees achieved by FedAvg. Our analysis roughly follows the four steps presented below: [Step 1] We first show a key result, that the ratio of the local stochastic gradients and the local full gradients stays bounded (Lemma 1). This result is crucial for the FedAvg-SGD analysis, as it allows us to work with the full local gradients directly, and it helps to bound the gradient drift across local updates within each communication round. [Step 2] Using the result of Step 1, we bound the summation of (stochastic) gradients and the gradient drift during the local updates within each communication round (Lemma 2). This result ensures that irrespective of the data heterogeneity, the gradients size will not change too much from their initial values at the beginning of each round. [Step 3] We then show that adopted network architecture allows us to derive bounds on the size of the gradients and ensure the loss function to be PL during the each communication round (Lemma 3). Utilizing this and the results derived in Steps 1 and 2, we show that the expected loss (3) converges linearly to zero (Proposition 1). [Step 4] Finally, we find a special initialization strategy so that all the conditions imposed on the network properties are satisfied during the entire training process. Next, let us begin with Step 1. We need the following definition. Definition 2. Given parameter \u03b8rt+vk , we define the following quantity for each k \u2208 [K], t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1} and v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1}: \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) := \u2225g\u0303 rt+v k \u22252/\u2225g rt+v k \u22252. Clearly, \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) measures the ratio of the norm of stochastic and full gradients of the local loss functions. In the following, we show that if the model parameters at each client satisfy certain conditions, then \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) is uniformly bounded. Define \u03c3max(\u00b7) and \u03c3min(\u00b7) as the largest and smallest singular value of a matrix, respectively. Lemma 1. Let Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. Suppose in any iteration rt+ v, v \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r \u2212 1}, for \u03b8rt+vk = [vec(W rt+v 1,k ), . . . , vec(W rt+v L,k )], there exists constant \u039b\u0304l, \u039bl, \u039bF > 0 such that the singular values of W rt+vl,k and F rt+v 1,k satisfy \u03c3max(W rt+v l,k ) \u2264 \u039b\u0304l, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(W rt+v l,k ) \u2265 \u039bl, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(F rt+v 1,k ) \u2265 \u039bF , k \u2208 [K]. (9) where \u03bbi\u2192j := j\u220f l=i \u03bbl for given layer-wise parameter \u03bbl, then: \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 LN \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF . As discussed earlier in Step 1, this lemma is crucial to our analysis as it allows us to work with full gradients of individual clients. Before proceeding to Step 2, we need the following definitions: g\u0304rt+v := K\u2211 k=1 Nk N grt+vk and \u00af\u0303g rt+v := K\u2211 k=1 Nk N g\u0303rt+vk . Here g\u0304rt+v and \u00af\u0303grt+v are the weighted averages of the full and stochastic gradients, respectively. Next, in Step 2 (Lemma 2) we first bound the size of the sum of \u00af\u0303grt+v over the local updates within each communication round. Then we bound the change in g\u0304rt+v from v = 0 to any v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1}. Note that this quantity measures the drift in the averaged gradients from the start of each communication round. Lemma 2. For FedAvg-SGD, given step size \u03b7 > 0, v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r\u22121} and q \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , v\u22121}. Suppose there exists constants \u039b\u0304l, \u03c1, and A > 0 such that the following conditions hold: \u039b\u0304l \u2265 sup k\u2208[K] \u03c3max ( W rt+ql,k ) , \u03c1 \u2265 sup k\u2208[K] \u03c1 ( \u03b8rt+qk ) , \u03a6k(\u03b8 rt+q) \u2264 Aq \u00b7 \u03a6k(\u03b8\u0304rt), k \u2208 [K]. Then we have \u2225\u2225 v\u2211 q=0 \u00af\u0303grt+q \u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u03c1L\u2225X\u2225F N A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u22252. (10) Further, for all k \u2208 [K], \u2203Qk > 0, such that we have \u2225\u2225g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u03b7\u03c1L N \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a K\u2211 k=1 Q2k \u2225Xk\u2225 2 F \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt)\u2212 y\u22252. (11) Next, we show Step 3, that the averaged parameter \u03b8\u0304rt defined in (6), after tth communication round, will have good performance. Towards this end, we define the full gradient given parameter \u03b8\u0304rt as grt := [vec(\u2207W1\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt), . . . , vec(\u2207WL\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)]. (12) Lemma 3. Let Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. At each communication round rt, suppose there exists constant \u2126\u0304l,\u2126l,\u2126F , such that  \u03c3max(W\u0304 rt l ) \u2264 \u2126\u0304l, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min(W\u0304 rt l ) \u2265 \u2126l, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, \u03c3min(F1(\u03b8\u0304 rt)) \u2265 \u2126F , (13) where \u03b8\u0304rt and W\u0304lrt are defined in (6). Then we have \u2225g(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u22252 \u2265 \u2225 vec ( \u2207W2\u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt )) \u22252 \u2265 \u03b3L\u22121 N \u21263\u2192L\u2126F \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 , (14) \u2225g(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u22252 \u2264 L N \u2126\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u2126\u0304l \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 . (15) Remark 3. Note that (14) is a PL-type inequality Karimi et al. (2016), and requires the special structure of the network that satisfies Assumption 2 Nguyen and Hein (2018); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). Also, (15) can be proven using Assumption 3. Now, we utilize the results of Steps 1 - 2 and Lemma 3 to derive the convergence of FedAvg. Proposition 1. Use Algorithm 1 to minimize (3). Suppose Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, and for each iteration rt+ v, v \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r \u2212 1}, \u03b8rt+vk satisfies the conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2; and for each communication round rt, \u03b8\u0304rt satisfies conditions in Lemma 3, then \u2203 \u03b7 > 0 such that E[\u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt ) ] \u2264 ( 1\u2212 r\u03b7 N \u03b32(L\u22122)\u212623\u2192L\u2126 2 F )t \u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) . (16) Remark 4. Proposition 1 above shows that, if the conditions in Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, i.e., we have well-behaved gradients (Lemmas 1 and 2) and PL condition (Lemma 3), we achieve linear convergence of expected loss function for solving (3) with FedAvg-SGD. We outline the major steps in the proof of Proposition 1. Proof Sketch. Consider the tth communication round, and suppose the singular values of the parameters satisfy (13), then it is easy to show that \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt) is Lipschitz smooth with some constant Q > 0. Then using the Lipschitz smoothness of \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt), we get \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1)) \u2264 \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 \u03b7 \u2329 grt, \u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u02dc\u0303grt+r\u22121 \u232a + Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 . Taking expectation on both sides and conditioning on \u03b8\u0304rt and the past, we get the following E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 E [ \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 \u03b7\u27e8grt, g\u0304rt + . . .+ g\u0304rt+r\u22121\u27e9+ Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 ] = E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt ) \u2212 \u03b7 \u2329 grt, rg\u0304rt \u232a \u2212 \u03b7\u27e8grt, r\u22121\u2211 v=1 g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u27e9+ Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 ] \u2264 E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt ) \u2212 \u03b7r\u2225grt\u222522 + \u03b7\u2225grt\u22252\u2225 r\u22121\u2211 v=1 g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u22252 + Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 ] . (17) Now we bound each term in (17) using Lemmas 2 and 3. We first use the upper and lower bounds in Lemma 3 to bound the gradient norm. First, to bound the second term on the right hand side (rhs) of (17) we use the PL-inequality in (14) of Lemma 3 \u2225grt\u22252 \u2265 \u03b3L\u22121 N \u21263\u2192L\u2126F \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 . (18) We bound gradient norm in the third term using the upper bound of gradient in (15) of Lemma 3 \u2225grt\u22252 \u2264 L N \u2126\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u2126\u0304l \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 := T1 (19) Additionally, we use (11) in Lemma 2 to bound the gradient drift in the third term, we get \u2225 r\u22121\u2211 v=1 g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u22252 \u2264 \u03b7 \u03c1L N \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a K\u2211 k=1 Q2k \u2225Xk\u2225 2 F \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt)\u2212 y\u22252 := T2 (20) Next, using (10) in Lemma 2 to bound fourth term on the rhs, the sum of stochastic gradient as\u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u03c1L\u2225X\u2225F N A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225f(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u22252 := T3. Finally, plugging the bounds for each term in (17), using the definition of loss function \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt) = 1 2N \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt)\u2212 y\u222522 along with the choice of step-size \u03b7 < \u03b32(L\u22121) N2 \u212623\u2192L\u2126 2 F 2T1T2+QT 23 , we get E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 ( 1\u2212 r\u03b7 N \u03b32(L\u22121)\u212623\u2192L\u2126 2 F ) E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)]. (21) Using the above inequality recursively, we get the statement of Proposition 1. Now Step 3 is complete and we move on to define the initialization strategy of Step 4. It is important to note that Proposition 1 utilized Lemmas 1 \u2013 3, all of which impose some conditions on the singular values of the model parameters and the outputs of the first layer at each client during the entire training phase. Next, we define the initialization strategy that ensures that the conditions of Lemmas 1 \u2013 3 are satisfied almost surely. Next, we go to Step 4, and discuss the initialization strategy. Define \u03bbl := \u03c3min ( W 0l ) and \u03bb\u0304l := { 2 3 ( 1 + \u03c3max(W 0 l ) ) , for l \u2208 {1, 2}, \u03c3max(W 0 l ), for l \u2208 {3, . . . , L} . (22) We also define the largest and smallest singular values of the output of the first layer at initialization for each client as \u03b10,k := \u03c3min ( \u03c3 ( XkW 0 1,k )) . Similarly, for the centralized setting when all the clients share the same parameter and full data, we define \u03b10 := \u03c3min ( \u03c3 ( XW 01 )) . Initialization Strategy: Given any \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), we initialize the model weights such that for some constants M1,M2,M3 > 0, the following are satisfied M1 min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u2225X\u2225F \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u00b7 \u03a6(\u03b8 0) 3 2 \u03f5 \u2264 { 1 2 \u03bb, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, 1, l \u2208 {1, 2}, , (23) M2 min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u00b7 \u03a6(\u03b8 0) 3 2 \u03f5 \u2264 min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) , M3\u03bb3\u2192L\u03b10 \u2265 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l . (24) To satisfy the required initialization, we follow the initialization strategy of Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). First, randomly initialize [ W 01 ] ij \u223c N (0, 1/d2in). Broadcast [W 01 ]ij to each client and collect F1,k, which is the output of the first layer of each client, as well as the norm of local data \u2225Xk\u2225F . With F1,k, \u03b10 and \u03b10,k can be computed. For (23), since we have n1 > N , \u03b10 and \u03b10,k are strictly positive. Then it is easy to verify that given \u03f5 > 0, (23) and the second relation in (24) will be satisfied if we choose large enough \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l . This can be realized by choosing arbitrarily large \u03bb\u0304l, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}. In order to satisfy the first relation in (24), we need to make \u03bb\u0304l and \u03bbl close to each other. Intuitively, one way is to construct ( W 0l )L l=3 such that \u03bbl = \u03bb\u0304l = \u03b6 > 1, where \u03b6 can be chosen to be any large number such that (23) and the second relation in (24) are satisfied. We also need to upper bound \u03a6(\u03b80). This can be done by choosing small W 02 . Randomly initialize W 02 such that [ W 02 ] ij \u223c N (0, \u03ba). We can set \u03ba to be arbitrarily small, then \u03a6(\u03b80) is bounded by 2 N \u2225y\u2225 2 2 with high probability (see (10) in Nguyen and Mondelli (2020)). Note that the desired error \u03f5 is another key constant in the initialization. When we expect the error to be small, (23) and the second relation in (24) will be more strict. But this is not an issue since we can choose a larger \u03b6 such that the initial conditions are satisfied. The detailed initialization strategy that ensures that the conditions of Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied is given in the Appendix B.2. Next, let us state our main result, which indicates the linear convergence of local SGD to any \u03f5optimal solution (see Definition 1). The proof is attached in Appendix B.3. Theorem 1. Using FedAvg-SGD to minimize (3) with Algorithm 1. Suppose Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, then there exists an initialization strategy such that for any \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), there exists step-size \u03b7 > 0 such that we have (where \u00b5\u2032 := r2N \u03b3 2(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0, and \u03b7\u00b5 \u2032 < 1) E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7)t \u03a6(\u03b80), t \u2208 {0, . . . , T \u2212 1}. Theorem 1 shows that, for any \u03f5 > 0, we can always find an initialization, such that FedAvgSG achieves an \u03f5 accuracy within O ( log( 1\u03f5 ) ) rounds of communication. Notice that there is no heterogeneity assumption on the data (see Remark 2), and no assumption on the Lipschitz gradient of the loss function. Remark 5. We comment on the key novelties of this work compared to Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). (1) Our work requires a careful analysis to deal with multiple local updates at each client. Note that in contrast to Nguyen and Mondelli (2020), for our algorithm there is no guarantee that the overall objective will always decrease during local updates. In fact, our analysis demonstrates that the overall objective can increase after each local iteration, we show that this increase will be compensated by the descent in the objective value between each communication round. (2) Our algorithm and analysis can deal with the stochastic gradients for conducting local updates, while Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) only considered gradient descent in a centralized setting. A key step in our analysis is to characterize the relationship between the stochastic and full gradient updates, which is illustrated in Lemma 1. Remark 6. We comment on the choice of parameters and the convergence rate. As will be shown in Appendix B.3, by utilizing our initialization strategy, we can choose \u03b7 = c/\u00b5\u2032 for some constant c \u2208 (0, 1) (independent of \u03f5). This implies that \u00b5\u2032\u03b7 = c < 1, which further implies that we have (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7) < 1 in Theorem 1, ensuring linear convergence of FedAvg-SGD. Finally, we present the convergence guarantees for the case when FedAvg-GD is utilized. Corollary 1. Using FedAvg-GD to minimize (3) with Algorithm 1. Suppose Assumptions 2 and 3 are satisfied, then there exists an initialization strategy and step-size \u03b7 > 0, such that we have \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1)) \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7)t \u03a6(\u03b80), \u2200t \u2208 {0, . . . , T \u2212 1}. (25) Remark 7. Corollary 1 implies that FedAvg-GD achieves linear convergence when optimizing (3). We note that the result of Corollary 1 is much stronger compared to Theorem 1 as the initialization for FedAvg-GD is independent of \u03f5 compared to the one for FedAvg-SGD (shown in Appendix B.2). 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we analyze the effect of increasing the network sizes on popular image classification tasks with MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. We compare the performance of FedAvg in both homogeneous (i.i.d.) and heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) data settings. Through our experiments we establish that larger sized networks uniformly outperform smaller networks under different settings. Next, we discuss the data and the model setting for our experiments. Data set: For MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets, we split the data set among K = 100 clients. For the homogeneous (i.i.d.) setting, we randomly distribute the complete data set with 60, 000 samples to each client. To model the heterogeneous (non i.i.d.) setting, we split the clients into two sets. One set of clients receive randomly drawn samples while the second set of clients receive data from only two out of ten labels McMahan et al. (2017). For our experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST data, 70% of the users receive non-i.i.d samples, while for CIFAR-10 data, the fraction is 20%. Results and Discussion For each setting, we compare the training loss and testing accuracy of FedAvg on smaller and larger sized networks. To analyze the effect of network sizes on the stability of FedAvg, we also plot the performance of FedAvg averaged over 10 iterations for non-i.i.d. client data setting for all the network architectures. From our experiments, we make a few observations. First, we observe from Figures 1 and 2 that in all the cases, the i.i.d setting has more stable performance (lower variance) than non-i.i.d setting. Second, we note that the larger network uniformly outperforms the smaller network under all the settings. Third, we note from the box plots in Figures 1 and 2 that the performance of the larger networks have lower variance, hence more stable performance compared with what can be achieved by the smaller networks. Finally, we compare the random initialization with special initialization strategy which satisfies (23), (24). We can conclude from Figure 3 that these two initialization are similar in test performance. APPENDIX:  A RELATED WORK: Overparameterized Neural Networks. The surprising performance of overparameterized neural networks has raised significant research interest in the ML community to analyze the phenomenon of overparameterization Belkin et al. (2019). Consequently, a number of works have analyzed the performance of centralized (stochastic) gradient descent (S)GD on overparameterized neural network architectures under different settings Jacot et al. (2018); Li and Liang (2018); Arora et al. (2019); Du et al. (2018; 2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Zou and Gu (2019); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020); Nguyen (2021). The authors in Jacot et al. (2018), showed that an infinite width neural network when trained using gradient descent (GD) behaves like a kernel method with the kernel defined as neural tangent kernel (NTK). Using this NTK parameterization Li and Liang (2018) showed that deep neural networks trained using GD require \u2126(N4) width to find the global optimal. This result was later improved to \u2126(N3) in Huang and Yau (2020). The authors in Du et al. (2018) and Du et al. (2019) also analyze the performance of GD on overparameterized neural networks under different settings. Under standard parameterization, the work Allen-Zhu et al. (2019) studied the convergence of SGD and showed that network width of \u2126(N24) suffices to guarantee linear convergence. Recently, Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) and Nguyen (2021) have improved the dependence on the width and have shown that GD requires only \u2126(N) width to achieve linear convergence. All the works mentioned above focus on the centralized setting, and therefore, do not deal with data heterogeneity problem. B PROOF OF MAIN RESULT:  B.1 PROOF OF LEMMAS: We define some additional notations before we state some lemmas which are needed in the proof.

(29) provides an upper bound on the norm of output of each layer while (30) gives an upper bound on the norm of gradient of each layer; (32) derives the Lipschitz constant of the networks and (33) provides the Lipschitz constant for the Jacobian of each layer. Similar results can be derived in centralized optimization problem, so we do not include the results here. Lemma 5. (Nguyen and Mondelli, 2020, Lemma 4.3) Let f : Rn \u2192 R be a C2 function. Let x, y \u2208 Rn be given, and assume that \u2225\u2207f(z)\u2212\u2207f(x)\u22252 \u2264 C\u2225z\u2212 x\u22252 for every z = x+ t(y\u2212 x) with t \u2208 [0, 1]. Then, f(y) \u2264 f(x) + \u27e8\u2207f(x), y \u2212 x\u27e9+ C 2 \u2225x\u2212 y\u22252. Lemma 6. For constant C, \u00b5, \u03c1, if \u03b7 \u2192 0, we have lim \u03b7\u21920 \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 = e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 (34) Furthermore, given \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), let T = \u230a log(\u03a6(\u03b80)/\u03f5) log( 11\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 ) + 1 \u230b , then there exists constant \u03be, such that sup 0<\u03b7<min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ) (\u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 )T \u2264 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 , (35) where \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 is a constant dependent on \u03c1 and \u00b5. Proof. Take logarithm on both sides, we get log (\u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 ) = \u2212 log( \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) log(1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7) = \u22121 2 \u00b7 log(1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) log(1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7) (36) Now let \u03b7 \u2192 0, by L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s rule, take derivative over \u03b7, we have lim \u03b7\u21920 \u22121 2 \u00b7 log(1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) log(1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7) = lim \u03b7\u21920 1 2 \u00b7 3\u03c1C \u00b5C 1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 = 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 . (37) Next, if we can show the function of \u03b7, which is \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 , has a limit when \u03b7 \u2192 min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ), then by the continuity, it has an upper bound in ( 0,min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ) ) , denote it as \u03be. It is easy to derive that lim \u03b7\u2192min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 = lim \u03b7\u2192min( 1\u03c1 , 1 \u00b5 ) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5\u03b7 { 2 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5 \u03c1 , \u03c1 > \u00b5, 1, \u03c1 \u2264 \u00b5. Then by the continuity of the function, (\u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 ) 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 is bounded by some constant \u03be. Then we can derive sup \u03b7\u2208(0,min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C )) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 T \u2265 lim \u03b7\u21920 \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1\u03b7 log(\u03a6(\u03b80)/\u03f5) log 1 1\u2212\u00b5\u03b7 = e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 \u00b7 \u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 (38) then we have there exists some constant \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 , such that sup \u03b7\u2208(0,min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C )) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 T \u2264 \u03be\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) \u03f5 . (39) Lemma 7. Let Assumption 2 and Assumption 3 hold. For \u03b8k, suppose there exists constant \u039b\u0304l, \u039bl, \u039bF such that and  \u03c3max(Wl,k) \u2264 \u039b\u0304l, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(Wl,k) \u2265 \u039bl, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(F1,k) \u2265 \u039bF , k \u2208 [K]. (40) then we have \u03c1(\u03b8k) \u2264 LN \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF (41) Proof. By definition, we have \u03c1(\u03b8k) = \u2225g\u0303k\u22252 \u2225gk\u22252 \u2264 \u2225g\u0303k\u22252 \u2225g2,k\u22252 . (42) Since by (31) and (28) in Lemma 4, we have \u2225g\u0303k\u22252 \u2264 L\u2225X\u0303k\u2225F m \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225f\u0303L,k(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u0303\u22252, (43) \u2225g2,k\u22252 \u2265 1 Nk \u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF \u2225fL,k(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u2225, (44) where Xk is the sampled data at \u03b8k. So we can derive \u03c1(\u03b8k) \u2264 L\u2225X\u0303k\u2225F m \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225f\u0303L,k(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u0303k\u22252 1 Nk \u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF \u2225fL,k(\u03b8)\u2212 yk\u22252 \u2264 LN\u2225X\u2225F \u039b\u03041\u2192Lmin l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF , (45) where the last inequality is because \u2225X\u0303k\u2225F \u2264 \u2225X\u2225F and \u2225f\u0303L,k(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u0303k\u22252 \u2264 \u2225fL,k(\u03b8)\u2212 yk\u22252.

B.2 INITIALIZATION STRATEGY Detailed Initialization for FedAvg-SGD: Denote P := L\u2225X\u2225F N ( 7 4 )L\u22121 (2r \u2212 1), C := PL\u2225X\u2225F ( 3 2 )L\u22121 \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l , (65) \u03c1 := LN\u2225X\u2225F 7L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192Lmin l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u03bb3\u2192L min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) , (66) \u00b5 := r 2N2 \u03b3 2(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0 C . (67) Suppose given any small \u03f5 such that \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), the initialized weights satisfies the following conditions: 2N 3 2 L\u2225X\u2225F ( 32 )L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u00b7 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 \u221a 2\u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 { 1 2\u03bbl, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}, 1, l \u2208 {1, 2}. (68) 2N 3 2 L( 32 ) L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u00b7 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 \u221a 2\u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 1 2 min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) . (69) where \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 is some constant dependent on \u03c1 and \u00b5. Now we provide a detailed way to realize the above initialization condition. To satisfy the required initialization, we follow the initialization strategy of Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). First, randomly initialize [ W 01 ] ij \u223c N (0, 1/d2in). Broadcast [W 01 ]ij to each client and collect F1,k, which is the output of the first layer of each client, as well as the norm of local data \u2225Xk\u2225F and norm of local label \u2225yk\u22252. With F1,k, \u03b10 and \u03b10,k can be computed. For (23), since we have n1 > N , \u03b10 and \u03b10,k are strictly positive with probability 1. Then it is easy to verify that given \u03f5 > 0, (23) and the second relation in (24) will be satisfied if we choose large enough \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l . This can be realized by choosing arbitrarily large \u03bbl, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}. However, notice that by Lemma 6, the constant \u03be, which is defined in (39), is only dependent on \u03c1 and \u00b5 and \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 . So if we can fix \u03c1 and \u00b5 as some constants, \u03be is a bounded constant. Notice in (66) and (67), for l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}, if we can make \u03bb\u0304l and \u03bbl close to each other, then \u03c1 and \u00b5 are also close, so 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 is not large. This is equivalent to the first relation in (24) in main text. In order to satisfy the above conditions, one way is to construct ( W 0l )L l=3 in such way that \u03bbl = \u03bb\u0304l = \u03b6 > 1, where \u03b6 can be chosen to be any large number such that (23) and the second relation in (24) are satisfied. Specifically, we can utilize the following construction: Initialize W 0l such that its top block is a scaled identity matrix and rest of entries are zero W 0l = [ \u03b6 \u00b7 Inl 0 ] \u2208 Rnl\u00d7nl\u22121 , l = 3, . . . , L. (70) We also need to upper bound \u03a6(\u03b80). This can be done by choosing small W 02 . Randomly initialize W 02 such that [ W 02 ] ij \u223c N (0, \u03ba). We can set \u03ba to be arbitrarily small, similar to (10) in Nguyen and Mondelli (2020),we can find a bound for \u03a6(\u03b80) with high probability:\u221a 2N\u03a6(\u03b80) = \u2225FL(\u03b80)\u2212 y\u2225F (71) \u2264 \u2225y\u22252 + \u2225\u2225FL (\u03b80)\u2225\u2225F \u2264 \u2225y\u22252 + L\u220f l=1 \u03c3max(W 0 l )\u2225X\u2225F \u2264 2\u2225y\u22252 (72) Then the loss function at initialization can be bounded by constant \u221a 2N\u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 2\u2225y\u22252. Initialization for FedAvg-GD: The initialized weight matrices satisfy the following conditions: 2N (( 3 2 )L\u22121 + 2L\u22121(r \u2212 1) ) \u2225X\u2225F r\u03b32(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121)2 2 3\u2192L\u03b1 2 0 \u00b7 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u03bb\u0304l \u2264 { 1 2\u03bbl, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L} 1, l \u2208 {1, 2} (73) 2N (( 3 2 )L\u22121 + 2L\u22121(r \u2212 1) ) \u2225X\u22252F r\u03b32(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121)2 \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0 \u00b7 \u03bb\u03042\u2192L \u2264 1 2 \u03b10. (74) The initialization strategy is similar to FedAvg-SGD, so we omit the discussion here. B.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 1: Theorem 1. Using FedAvg-SGD to minimize (3) with Algorithm 1. Suppose Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, then there exists an initialization strategy such that for any \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), there exists step-size \u03b7 > 0 such that we have E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7)t \u03a6(\u03b80), t \u2208 {0, . . . , T \u2212 1} (75) where \u00b5\u2032 = rN \u03b3 2(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0. Proof. First, we provide a structure of our proof. We will show the following recursively at each communication round: 1) The averaged weights are bounded at each communication round; 2) The divergence of loss function (3) is bounded at each communication round; 3) The expected loss function (3) decreases linearly at each communication round. Further, we will show that in each local epoch within a fixed communication round, we have: 1) The weights of each client are bounded; 2) The divergence of loss function \u03a6k of each client is bounded. Now let us set T = \u230a log(\u03a6(\u03b80)/\u03f5) log( 11\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 ) + 1 \u230b . If we can show (75) holds for t = 0, . . . , T , then it is easy to show that E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rT )] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7)T \u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 \u03f5. We prove Theorem 1 by induction. Define \u03c1rt+v := sup k\u2208[K] q\u2208{0,1,...,v} \u03c1(\u03b8rt+qk ) \u03c1 := Lm\u2225X\u2225F 7L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192Lmin l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l N\u03b3L\u22122\u03bb3\u2192L min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) , (76) We show that \u2200t \u2264 T , we have \u03c3max ( W\u0304 ru ) \u2264 32 \u03bb\u0304l u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min ( W\u0304 ru ) \u2a7e 12\u03bbl, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, \u03c3min (F ru 1 ) \u2a7e 1 2\u03b10, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, \u03c3min ( F ru1,k ) \u2265 12\u03b10,k, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c1rt \u2264 \u03c1, \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru ) \u2a7d (1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7)u \u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru )] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7)u\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} . (77) where \u03bb\u0304l is defined in (22) and \u03bbl is the smallest eigen value of the weight matrix, C, \u00b5, \u03c1 defined in B.2 and \u00b5C = \u00b5\u2032. The above recursive equation describes the weight matrix and loss function in each communication round. To prove (77), we decompose the recursive equation into two steps, as follows Step1: For a fixed t and v \u2208 [r \u2212 1], given \u03c3max ( W\u0304l ru ) \u2a7d 32 \u03bb\u0304l, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min ( W\u0304l ru ) \u2a7e 12\u03bbl, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min (F ru 1 ) \u2a7e 1 2\u03b10, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, \u03c1rt \u2264 \u03c1; \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru ) \u2264 (1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7)u\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru )] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7)u\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+qk ) \u2264 (1 + 3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7)q\u03a6k (\u03b8rtk ) , q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c3max ( W rt+ql,k ) \u2264 74 \u03bb\u0304l, q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min ( W rt+ql,k ) \u2264 14\u03bbl, q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min ( F rt+q1,k ) \u2265 14\u03b10,k, q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c1rt+v\u22121 \u2264 \u03c1, .

(95) Since we have already shown in (81) that \u03c3max(W rt+vl,k ) \u2264 7 4 \u03bb\u0304l, \u03c3min(W rt+v l,k ) \u2265 1 4 \u03bb\u0304l and we have shown in (89) that \u03c3min(F rt+v1 ) \u2265 14\u03b10,k. By lemma 1, we have \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 ( 74 ) L\u22121LN\u2225X\u2225F \u03bb\u03041\u2192Lmin l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l ( 14 ) L\u22121m\u03b3L\u22122\u03bb3\u2192L min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k \u2264 \u03c1. (96) (4) Next, we prove \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+qk ) \u2a7d (1 + 3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7)q\u03a6k ( \u03b8rtk ) , q \u2208 {0, . . . , v}, k \u2208 [K]. (97) We show \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) \u2a7d (1 + 3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7)v\u03a6k ( \u03b8rtk ) . (98) First, we need to show \u03a6k has Lipschitz gradient within [\u03b8rt+v\u22121, \u03b8rt+v]. This is similar to the proof of (50) in Lemma 8. So we don\u2019t include the details here. It is easy to show that, for \u03b8rt+v\u22121,sk := \u03b8rt+v\u22121k + s(\u03b8 rt+v k \u2212 \u03b8 rt+v\u22121 k ), there is max ( \u03c3max ( W rt+v\u22121,sl,k ) , \u03c3max ( W rt+v\u22121l,k )) \u2264 74 \u03bb\u0304l. So similarly we can derive the Lipschitz constant Qk = L \u221a L Nk ( 7 4 )2(L\u22121) \u2225Xk\u22252F \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l + L \u221a L Nk \u2225Xk\u2225F (1 + L\u03b2 \u2225Xk\u2225F R \u2032)R\u2032 \u2225\u2225f0L,k \u2212 yk\u2225\u22252 , (99) such that \u2200s \u2208 [0, 1],\u2225\u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121,sk \u2212 grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 Qk\u2225\u03b8rt+v\u22121,sk \u2212 \u03b8 rt+v\u22121 k \u22252. (100) With Lipschitz gradient within [\u03b8rt+v\u22121k , \u03b8 rt+v k ], by Lemma 5, we have \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u27e8\u2207\u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) , \u03b8rt+vk \u2212 \u03b8 rt+v k \u232a + Qk 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8rt+v\u22121k \u2212 \u03b8rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (101) = \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u2329 grt+v\u22121k ,\u2212\u03b7g\u0303 rt+v\u22121 k \u232a + Qk 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b7g\u0303rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (102) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u03b7 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u22252 \u2225\u2225g\u0303rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u22252 + Qk2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225g\u0303rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (103) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u03b7\u03c1 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 + Qk2 \u03b72\u03c12 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (104) Let \u03b7 < 1Qk\u03c1 , we have the above inequality \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u03b7\u03c1 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 + Qk2 \u03b72\u03c12 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (105) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + 3 2 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (106) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) + 3\u03c1\u03b7L Nk ( 7 4 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) , (107) where the third inequality comes from (31) in Lemma 4. Recall C \u2032 := max k ( 1Nk ( 7 4 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l ), we have \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v+1k ) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vN ) (1 + 3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7). (108) Now Step 1 is proved. Next we show Step 2.

(109) Define \u2207\u0303Wl,k\u03a6k(\u03b8rtk ) be the stochastic gradient over layer l of each client.

Then it is easy to verify that the assumptions in Lemma 8 are satisfied, where \u039b\u0304l = 74 \u03bb\u0304l, Qk is defined in (63) and A = 1+3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7.

(153) Remark 8. To satisfy the initialization assumptions defined in (69) and (68), we initialize the neural network coefficients such that we have \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u223c O(1/\u03f5). Note from the definition of \u00b5\u2032 in (152) that this implies \u00b5\u2032 \u223c O(\u03bb23\u2192L) = O(\u03bb\u030421\u2192L) = O(1/\u03f52). Also, note from the choice of step-size in (153) that, we have \u03b7 \u223c O(\u03f5 \u00d7 1/\u03bb\u03041\u2192L) = O(\u03f52). Note that this follows from the fact that \u03b7 is smaller than each quantity defined in (153) above. Thus, we have \u00b5\u2032\u03b7 = O(1) and we can always choose \u03b7 = c/\u00b5\u2032 for some c \u2208 (0, 1), which guarantees linear convergence of the objective in each communication round (see Theorem 1). C EXPERIMENT SETTING AND RESULT:  C.1 MODEL AND PARAMETER SETTINGS:: To analyze the performance of FedAvg-SGD on the MNIST data set, we use a single hidden-layer fully-connected neural network (MLP) with ReLU activation. We set the hidden-layer size to be 32 (resp. 1, 000) for the small (resp. large) network. We choose the mini-batch size m = 10 and choose the number of local steps to be r = 10. Using the above network, we also compare the random initialization with the special initialization strategy in (23),(24) with MNIST and Fashion MNIST dataset. For the CIFAR-10 data set, we analyze the performance of FedAvg-SGD on two network architectures \u2013 convolutional neural network (CNN) and ResNet. We design the smaller CNN using two 5 \u00d7 5 convolutional layers followed by 2 \u00d7 2 max pooling, each has 6 and 16 channels, connected by 2 fully-connected layers with 120 and 84 hidden neurons. For larger CNN, we use three 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layers each with 128 channels followed by 2 \u00d7 2 max pooling. The ReLU activation function is used after each hidden layer for small/large CNN. For ResNet, we compare the performance on ResNet18 with ResNet50 architectures. For both the CNN and ResNet, we use a mini-batch size of m = 32 and number of local steps to be r = 5. We randomly sample 10 clients in each epoch and perform FedAvg-SGD for more efficient training.

The paper title is: FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly: The Power of Overparameterized Multi-Layer Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients collaborate with the help of a server to learn a joint model McMahan et al. (2017). The privacy guarantees of FL has made it a popular distributed learning paradigm, as each client holds a private data set and aims to learn a global model without leaking its data to other nodes or the server. The performance of FL algorithms is known to degrade when training data at individual nodes originates from different distributions, referred to as the heterogeneous data setting Yu et al. (2019a); Woodworth et al. (2020a). In the past few years, a substantial research effort has been devoted towards developing a large number of algorithms that can better deal with data heterogeneity, Karimireddy et al. (2020b); Zhang et al. (2021); Li et al. (2018); Acar et al. (2020); Khanduri et al. (2021). However, in practice it has been observed by a number of recent works, that in spite of the data heterogeneity, the simple vanilla FedAvg algorithm (a.k.a. the Local SGD) still offers competitive performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art. For example, see Table 2 in Karimireddy et al. (2020a), Table 1 in Reddi et al. (2020), and Table 2 in Yang et al. (2021) for performance comparison of FedAvg on popular FL tasks. Motivated by these observations, we ask: Is it possible to handle the the data heterogeneity issue from a different perspective, without modifying the vanilla FedAvg algorithm? To answer this question, in this work we show that FedAvg can indeed perform very well regardless of the heterogeneity conditions, if the models to be learned are nice enough. Specifically, FedAvg finds solutions that achieve almost zero training loss (or almost global optimal solution) very quickly (i.e., linearly), when the FL model to be trained is certain overparameterized multi-layer neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that shows (linear) convergence of FedAvg in the overparameterized regime for training multilayer neural networks. The major contributions of our work are listed below. \u2022 Under certain assumptions on the neural network architecture, we prove some key properties of the clients\u2019 (stochastic) gradients during the training phase (Lemmas 1 and 2). These results allow us to establish convergence of FedAvg for training overparameterized neural networks without imposing restrictive heterogeneity assumptions on the gradients of the local loss functions. \u2022 We design a special initialization strategy for training the network using FedAvg. The initialization is designed such that the singular values of the model parameters and the outputs of the first layer of local and aggregated model parameters stay positive definite during the training. This property combined with overparameterization enables FedAvg to converge linearly to a (near) optimal solution. \u2022 We conduct experiments on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets in both i.i.d. and heterogeneous data settings to compare the performance of FedAvg on various network architectures of different sizes. To our knowledge, this is the first work that shows the linear convergence of FedAvg (both SGD and GD versions) to the optimal solution when training a overparameterized multi-layer neural networks. Related Work: Federated Learning (FL). FL algorithms were first proposed in McMahan et al. (2017), where within each communication round the clients utilize their private data to update the model parameters using multiple SGD steps. Earlier works analyzed the performance of FedAvg for the case of homogeneous data setting Zhou and Cong (2018); Stich (2018); Lin et al. (2020); Woodworth et al. (2020b); Wang and Joshi (2021), i.e., when the local data at each client follows the same underlying distribution. Motivated by practical applications, recent works have analyzed FedAvg for heterogeneous client data distributions Yu et al. (2019b;a); Haddadpour and Mahdavi (2019); Woodworth et al. (2020a) and it was observed that the performance of FedAvg degrades as the data heterogeneity increases. To address the data heterogeneity issue among clients, many works have focused on developing sophisticated algorithms Karimireddy et al. (2020b); Zhang et al. (2021); Acar et al. (2020); Li et al. (2018); Khanduri et al. (2021); Karimireddy et al. (2020a); Das et al. (2020). Overparameterized Neural Networks. The surprising performance of overparameterized neural networks1 has raised significant research interest in the ML community to analyze the phenomenon of overparameterization Belkin et al. (2019). Consequently, many works have analyzed the performance of centralized (stochastic) gradient descent (S)GD on overparameterized neural network architectures under different settings Jacot et al. (2018); Li and Liang (2018); Arora et al. (2019); Du et al. (2018; 2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Zou and Gu (2019); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020); Nguyen (2021). However, there are only a handful of works that have attempted to analyze the performance of overparameterized neural networks in the distributed setting Li et al. (2021); Huang et al. (2021); Deng and Mahdavi (2021). The works most closely related to our work are Huang et al. (2021) and Deng and Mahdavi (2021). Huang et al. (2021) analyzed the performance of FedAvg on a single hidden-layer neural network for the case when each client utilizes GD for the local updates. The authors established linear convergence of FedAvg using the NTK parameterization and showed that it suffices to design the neural network of width \u2126(N4) to achieve this performance (where N is the number of training samples). Similarly, Deng and Mahdavi (2021) analyzed the performance of FedAvg on a ReLU neural network but when each client utilizes SGD (or GD) for the local updates. The authors proved convergence of FedAvg under the standard parameterization while requiring the very large network width of \u2126(N18). Note that since individual clients can be devices with limited computational capabilities, in realistic settings it is undesirable to have networks of such large widths. In contrast to both these works, we focus on the more practical setting of a multi-layer neural network Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) and establish linear convergence of FedAvg even for the case when each client utilizes SGD for the local updates. Importantly, we show that with proper initialization, it only requires a network of width N at each client, which is much smaller compared to the unrealistic requirements of Huang et al. (2021); Deng and Mahdavi (2021). 2 PROBLEM SETUP: In this section, we define the multi-layer neural network and formalize the problem we aim to solve. We consider a distributed system of K clients with each client having access to a privately held data set. We assume that each client k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K } has Nk training samples denoted as {(Xk, Yk)}, with Xk \u2208 RNk\u00d7din and Yk \u2208 RNk\u00d7dout . Note that each row of Xk and Yk represents the feature vector and its corresponding label, and din and dout denote the feature (input) and label (output) dimensions, respectively. We further denote N = \u2211K k=1 Nk as the total samples across all clients. 1A model is generally referred to as overparameterized if the number of (trainable) parameters are more than the number of training samples N . Suppose each client trains a fully-connected neural network with L layers, and with activation function \u03c3 : R \u2192 R. We denote the vectorized parameters at each node k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} as \u03b8k = [vec (W1,k) , . . . , vec (WL,k)] \u2208 RD, where Wl,k \u2208 Rnl\u22121\u00d7nl represents the weight matrix of each layer l \u2208 {1, . . . , L} and nl represents the width of each layer. Note that each layer inputs a (feature) vector of dimension nl\u22121 and outputs a (feature) vector of dimension nl. For simplicity, define n0 = din and nL = dout as the input and the output dimensions of the neural network. We define Fl,k as the local output of each layer l at client k, then using the above notations, we have Fl,k =  Xk l = 0 \u03c3 (Fl\u22121,kWl,k) l \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , L} FL\u22121,kWL,k l = L . (1) We further define the vectorized output of each layer and the labels at each client as fl,k = vec(Fl,k) \u2208 RNknl and yk = vec(Yk) \u2208 RNknL . Similar to the above setup, we also define the notations to describe a single network, with the full data (X,Y ) with X \u2208 RN\u00d7din and Y \u2208 RN\u00d7dout as input. This \u201ccentralized\" network will be useful later to perform the analysis. Then given parameter \u03b8 = [vec (W1) , . . . , vec (WL)], the output at each layer of the network is defined as Fl =  X l = 0 \u03c3 (Fl\u22121Wl) l \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , L} FL\u22121WL l = L . (2) Next, we define the local and global loss functions. First, each client k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} has a local loss function given by: \u03a6k(\u03b8) := 12Nk \u2225fL,k(\u03b8)\u2212 yk\u2225 2 2, where \u2225 \u00b7 \u22252 denotes the standard \u21132-norm. Then the global loss function is the sum of weighted local loss functions, given by: \u03a6(\u03b8) := K\u2211 k=1 Nk N \u03a6k(\u03b8) = 1 2N \u2225FL(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u22252F . (3) Additionally, define the gradient of (3) as g := [vec(\u2207W1\u03a6(\u03b8)), . . . , vec(\u2207WL\u03a6(\u03b8))], which is the stacked gradient of the loss w.r.t. the 1st to Lth layer\u2019s parameters; define the gradient of the losses at each client k \u2208 [K] as: gk := [g1,k, . . . , gL,K ] with gl,k := vec(\u2207Wl,k\u03a6(\u03b8)) for all l \u2208 [L]. Next, we define the optimality criteria to solve (3) using an overparameterized neural network. Definition 1 (\u03f5-optimal solution). Consider an overparameterized problem min\u03b8 \u03a6(\u03b8), where there exist \u03b8\u2217 such that \u03a6(\u03b8\u2217) = 0. A solution \u03b8 is called an \u03f5-optimal solution if it satisfies \u03a6(x) \u2264 \u03f5. Moreover, if x is a random variable, then we use E[\u03a6(x)] \u2264 \u03f5 to denote an \u03f5-optimal solution, where the expectation is taken w.r.t. the randomness of x. 3 THE FEDAVG ALGORITHM: A classical algorithm to solve problem (3) is the FedAvg McMahan et al. (2017). In FedAvg, each client performs multiple local updates before sharing their updated parameters with the server. We refer the algorithm as FedAvg-SGD (resp. FedAvg-GD) if the clients employ SGD (resp. GD) for the local updates. The detailed steps to implement FedAvg-SGD are listed in Algorithm 1. We execute the algorithm for a total of T communication rounds, within each communication round every client performs r local updates. In each communication round t the server aggregates the local parameters and constructs \u03b8\u0304rt from each client\u2019s local parameters \u03b8rt+rk and shares it with the clients. The clients use the aggregated parameter, \u03b8\u0304rt+rk , as the initial parameter value for computing the next round of local updates. For each v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1}, to update the local parameters the clients compute the (unbiased) stochastic gradient using m-samples drawn form their private data set (Xk, Yk). We denote the random sample drawn at vth local step in the tth communication round as (X\u0303rt+vk , Y\u0303 rt+v k ). Using the stochastic gradient estimate, the clients update their parameters locally by employing the SGD step. After r local SGD steps, each client shares its updated parameters with the server and gets back the aggregated parameters before starting the next round of updates. Note that if we choose the batch size m = Nk, for all k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}, FedAvg-SGD becomes FedAvg-GD. Algorithm 1 The FedAvg-SGD Algorithm Initialize: Parameters \u03b80k = \u03b80, Step-size \u03b7, # of communication rounds, local updates T , r for t = 0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1 do for each client k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} do Set \u03b8rtk = \u03b8\u0304 rt for v = 0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1 do Sample mini-batch of size m, (X\u0303rt+vk , Y\u0303 rt+v k ) Compute stochastic gradient g\u0303rt+vk using (5) Update: \u03b8rt+v+1k = \u03b8 rt+v k \u2212 \u03b7g\u0303 rt+v k . Aggregation: \u03b8\u0304r(t+1) = K\u2211 k=1 Nk N \u03b8 rt+r k Return: Parameters, \u03b8\u0304rT Algorithm 1 summarizes the above description. For each communication round t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1} and local step v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r\u22121}, we define the vector \u03b8rt+vk := [vec(W rt+v1,k ), . . . , vec(W rt+v L,k )]. For FedAvgSGD, define F\u0303 rt+vl,k and f\u0303 rt+v l,k as the output and the vectorized output of each hidden layer l, respectively, when the input to the client k\u2019s local network is the stochastic (mini-batch) samples (X\u0303rt+vk , Y\u0303 rt+v k ). Using the notation y\u0303rt+vk = vec(Y\u0303 rt+v k ) as the vectorized labels of the stochastic samples at each local step, we define the mini-batch stochastic loss as: \u03a6\u0303k(\u03b8 rt+v k ) := 1 2m \u2225f\u0303rt+vL,k \u2212 y\u0303 rt+v k \u2225 2 2, (4) and the stochastic gradient as g\u0303rt+vk := [g\u0303 rt+v 1,k , . . . , g\u0303 rt+v L,k ], where g\u0303 rt+v l,k is the stochastic gradient w.r.t. the lth layer of the network evaluated at the kth client: g\u0303rt+vl,k := vec ( \u2207Wl,k\u03a6\u0303k(\u03b8 rt+v k ) ) \u2208 Rnl\u22121nl . (5) For each communication round, let us define the aggregated parameters as: \u03b8\u0304rt := [ vec(W\u0304 rt1 ), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vec(W\u0304 rtL ) ] , W\u0304 rtl = K\u2211 k=1 Nk N W rtl,k. (6) For FedAvg-GD, we denote grt+vk := [g rt+v 1,k , . . . , g rt+v L,k ] as the full gradient of k th client\u2019s loss function, where similar to (5) grt+v1,k defines the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. the l th layer\u2019s parameters. Throughout, we make the following standard assumption Ghadimi and Lan (2013). Assumption 1. The stochastic gradients at each client are unbiased, i.e., we have E[g\u0303rt+vk ] = g rt+v k \u2200k \u2208 [K]. Next, we analyze the performance of the FedAvg for an overparameterized neural network. 4 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS: We present the convergence guarantees of FedAvg when training an overparameterized neural network. We first present a set of assumptions on the network architecture, and activation functions. Assumption 2. The width of each hidden layer satisfies: n1 \u2265 N, n2 \u2265 n3 \u2265 . . . \u2265 nL \u2265 1. Assumption 3. The activation function \u03c3(\u00b7) in (1) satisfies the following: 1) \u03c3\u2032(x) \u2208 [\u03b3, 1]; 2) |\u03c3(x)| \u2264 |x|; \u2200 x \u2208 R; 3) \u03c3\u2032 is \u03b2-Lipschitz, with \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b2 > 0. Remark 1. Assumptions 2 and 3 play an important role in our analysis. They help ensure that the local and global loss functions and their (stochastic) gradients are well behaved. Note that Assumption 2 only requires the first layer to be wide while the rest of the layers can be of constant width. Assumption 2 is required to establish a PL like property for the global and local loss functions Nguyen and Hein (2018); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). Assumption 3 is also standard in the analysis of overparameterized neural networks. Similar assumptions on the smoothness of the activation functions have been made in the past Jacot et al. (2018); Du et al. (2019); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020); Huang and Yau (2020) and are utilized to manage the behavior of the gradients of the loss functions. Importantly, note that as demonstrated in Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) activation functions satisfying Assumption 3 can be utilized to uniformly approximate the ReLU function to arbitrary accuracy. Remark 2. We do not impose any assumptions on the distribution of individual clients\u2019 local data sets. In contrast, a majority of works on FL impose restrictive assumptions on the gradients (and/or the Hessians) of each client\u2019s local loss functions to guarantee algorithm convergence Yu et al. (2019b); Li et al. (2018); Yu et al. (2019a); Karimireddy et al. (2020a). Below, we list two most popular heterogeneity assumptions (from Yu et al. (2019a) and Koloskova et al. (2020), respectively): \u2225\u2207\u03a6k(\u03b81)\u2212\u2207\u03a6(\u03b82)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b4, \u2200\u03b81, \u03b82 \u2208 RD, \u2200 k \u2208 [K], for some \u03b4 > 0. (7) 1 K K\u2211 k=1 \u2225\u2207\u03a6k(\u03b8)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b41 + \u03b42\u2225\u2207\u03a6(\u03b8)\u2225, \u2200 \u03b8 \u2208 RD, for some \u03b41, \u03b42 > 0. (8) Both conditions impose strong restrictions on the gradients of the local clients, and they do not hold for even simple quadratic loss Khaled et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2021). We will see shortly that, our results will indicate that as long as the neural network is large enough, then the local (stochastic) gradients will be well-behaved, thereby eliminating the need to impose any additional assumptions on the data distributions. In the following, we show the convergence guarantees achieved by FedAvg. Our analysis roughly follows the four steps presented below: [Step 1] We first show a key result, that the ratio of the local stochastic gradients and the local full gradients stays bounded (Lemma 1). This result is crucial for the FedAvg-SGD analysis, as it allows us to work with the full local gradients directly, and it helps to bound the gradient drift across local updates within each communication round. [Step 2] Using the result of Step 1, we bound the summation of (stochastic) gradients and the gradient drift during the local updates within each communication round (Lemma 2). This result ensures that irrespective of the data heterogeneity, the gradients size will not change too much from their initial values at the beginning of each round. [Step 3] We then show that adopted network architecture allows us to derive bounds on the size of the gradients and ensure the loss function to be PL during the each communication round (Lemma 3). Utilizing this and the results derived in Steps 1 and 2, we show that the expected loss (3) converges linearly to zero (Proposition 1). [Step 4] Finally, we find a special initialization strategy so that all the conditions imposed on the network properties are satisfied during the entire training process. Next, let us begin with Step 1. We need the following definition. Definition 2. Given parameter \u03b8rt+vk , we define the following quantity for each k \u2208 [K], t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1} and v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1}: \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) := \u2225g\u0303 rt+v k \u22252/\u2225g rt+v k \u22252. Clearly, \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) measures the ratio of the norm of stochastic and full gradients of the local loss functions. In the following, we show that if the model parameters at each client satisfy certain conditions, then \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) is uniformly bounded. Define \u03c3max(\u00b7) and \u03c3min(\u00b7) as the largest and smallest singular value of a matrix, respectively. Lemma 1. Let Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. Suppose in any iteration rt+ v, v \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r \u2212 1}, for \u03b8rt+vk = [vec(W rt+v 1,k ), . . . , vec(W rt+v L,k )], there exists constant \u039b\u0304l, \u039bl, \u039bF > 0 such that the singular values of W rt+vl,k and F rt+v 1,k satisfy \u03c3max(W rt+v l,k ) \u2264 \u039b\u0304l, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(W rt+v l,k ) \u2265 \u039bl, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(F rt+v 1,k ) \u2265 \u039bF , k \u2208 [K]. (9) where \u03bbi\u2192j := j\u220f l=i \u03bbl for given layer-wise parameter \u03bbl, then: \u03c1(\u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 LN \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF . As discussed earlier in Step 1, this lemma is crucial to our analysis as it allows us to work with full gradients of individual clients. Before proceeding to Step 2, we need the following definitions: g\u0304rt+v := K\u2211 k=1 Nk N grt+vk and \u00af\u0303g rt+v := K\u2211 k=1 Nk N g\u0303rt+vk . Here g\u0304rt+v and \u00af\u0303grt+v are the weighted averages of the full and stochastic gradients, respectively. Next, in Step 2 (Lemma 2) we first bound the size of the sum of \u00af\u0303grt+v over the local updates within each communication round. Then we bound the change in g\u0304rt+v from v = 0 to any v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 1}. Note that this quantity measures the drift in the averaged gradients from the start of each communication round. Lemma 2. For FedAvg-SGD, given step size \u03b7 > 0, v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , r\u22121} and q \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , v\u22121}. Suppose there exists constants \u039b\u0304l, \u03c1, and A > 0 such that the following conditions hold: \u039b\u0304l \u2265 sup k\u2208[K] \u03c3max ( W rt+ql,k ) , \u03c1 \u2265 sup k\u2208[K] \u03c1 ( \u03b8rt+qk ) , \u03a6k(\u03b8 rt+q) \u2264 Aq \u00b7 \u03a6k(\u03b8\u0304rt), k \u2208 [K]. Then we have \u2225\u2225 v\u2211 q=0 \u00af\u0303grt+q \u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u03c1L\u2225X\u2225F N A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u22252. (10) Further, for all k \u2208 [K], \u2203Qk > 0, such that we have \u2225\u2225g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u03b7\u03c1L N \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a K\u2211 k=1 Q2k \u2225Xk\u2225 2 F \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt)\u2212 y\u22252. (11) Next, we show Step 3, that the averaged parameter \u03b8\u0304rt defined in (6), after tth communication round, will have good performance. Towards this end, we define the full gradient given parameter \u03b8\u0304rt as grt := [vec(\u2207W1\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt), . . . , vec(\u2207WL\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)]. (12) Lemma 3. Let Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. At each communication round rt, suppose there exists constant \u2126\u0304l,\u2126l,\u2126F , such that  \u03c3max(W\u0304 rt l ) \u2264 \u2126\u0304l, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min(W\u0304 rt l ) \u2265 \u2126l, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, \u03c3min(F1(\u03b8\u0304 rt)) \u2265 \u2126F , (13) where \u03b8\u0304rt and W\u0304lrt are defined in (6). Then we have \u2225g(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u22252 \u2265 \u2225 vec ( \u2207W2\u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt )) \u22252 \u2265 \u03b3L\u22121 N \u21263\u2192L\u2126F \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 , (14) \u2225g(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u22252 \u2264 L N \u2126\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u2126\u0304l \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 . (15) Remark 3. Note that (14) is a PL-type inequality Karimi et al. (2016), and requires the special structure of the network that satisfies Assumption 2 Nguyen and Hein (2018); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). Also, (15) can be proven using Assumption 3. Now, we utilize the results of Steps 1 - 2 and Lemma 3 to derive the convergence of FedAvg. Proposition 1. Use Algorithm 1 to minimize (3). Suppose Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, and for each iteration rt+ v, v \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r \u2212 1}, \u03b8rt+vk satisfies the conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2; and for each communication round rt, \u03b8\u0304rt satisfies conditions in Lemma 3, then \u2203 \u03b7 > 0 such that E[\u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt ) ] \u2264 ( 1\u2212 r\u03b7 N \u03b32(L\u22122)\u212623\u2192L\u2126 2 F )t \u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) . (16) Remark 4. Proposition 1 above shows that, if the conditions in Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, i.e., we have well-behaved gradients (Lemmas 1 and 2) and PL condition (Lemma 3), we achieve linear convergence of expected loss function for solving (3) with FedAvg-SGD. We outline the major steps in the proof of Proposition 1. Proof Sketch. Consider the tth communication round, and suppose the singular values of the parameters satisfy (13), then it is easy to show that \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt) is Lipschitz smooth with some constant Q > 0. Then using the Lipschitz smoothness of \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt), we get \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1)) \u2264 \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 \u03b7 \u2329 grt, \u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u02dc\u0303grt+r\u22121 \u232a + Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 . Taking expectation on both sides and conditioning on \u03b8\u0304rt and the past, we get the following E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 E [ \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 \u03b7\u27e8grt, g\u0304rt + . . .+ g\u0304rt+r\u22121\u27e9+ Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 ] = E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt ) \u2212 \u03b7 \u2329 grt, rg\u0304rt \u232a \u2212 \u03b7\u27e8grt, r\u22121\u2211 v=1 g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u27e9+ Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 ] \u2264 E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304rt ) \u2212 \u03b7r\u2225grt\u222522 + \u03b7\u2225grt\u22252\u2225 r\u22121\u2211 v=1 g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u22252 + Q 2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 ] . (17) Now we bound each term in (17) using Lemmas 2 and 3. We first use the upper and lower bounds in Lemma 3 to bound the gradient norm. First, to bound the second term on the right hand side (rhs) of (17) we use the PL-inequality in (14) of Lemma 3 \u2225grt\u22252 \u2265 \u03b3L\u22121 N \u21263\u2192L\u2126F \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 . (18) We bound gradient norm in the third term using the upper bound of gradient in (15) of Lemma 3 \u2225grt\u22252 \u2264 L N \u2126\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u2126\u0304l \u2225\u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u2225\u22252 := T1 (19) Additionally, we use (11) in Lemma 2 to bound the gradient drift in the third term, we get \u2225 r\u22121\u2211 v=1 g\u0304rt+v \u2212 g\u0304rt\u22252 \u2264 \u03b7 \u03c1L N \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a K\u2211 k=1 Q2k \u2225Xk\u2225 2 F \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt)\u2212 y\u22252 := T2 (20) Next, using (10) in Lemma 2 to bound fourth term on the rhs, the sum of stochastic gradient as\u2225\u2225\u00af\u0303grt + . . .+ \u00af\u0303grt+r\u22121\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 \u03c1L\u2225X\u2225F N A v+1 2 \u2212 1\u221a A\u2212 1 \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225f(\u03b8\u0304rt)\u2212 y\u22252 := T3. Finally, plugging the bounds for each term in (17), using the definition of loss function \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt) = 1 2N \u2225fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt)\u2212 y\u222522 along with the choice of step-size \u03b7 < \u03b32(L\u22121) N2 \u212623\u2192L\u2126 2 F 2T1T2+QT 23 , we get E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 ( 1\u2212 r\u03b7 N \u03b32(L\u22121)\u212623\u2192L\u2126 2 F ) E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rt)]. (21) Using the above inequality recursively, we get the statement of Proposition 1. Now Step 3 is complete and we move on to define the initialization strategy of Step 4. It is important to note that Proposition 1 utilized Lemmas 1 \u2013 3, all of which impose some conditions on the singular values of the model parameters and the outputs of the first layer at each client during the entire training phase. Next, we define the initialization strategy that ensures that the conditions of Lemmas 1 \u2013 3 are satisfied almost surely. Next, we go to Step 4, and discuss the initialization strategy. Define \u03bbl := \u03c3min ( W 0l ) and \u03bb\u0304l := { 2 3 ( 1 + \u03c3max(W 0 l ) ) , for l \u2208 {1, 2}, \u03c3max(W 0 l ), for l \u2208 {3, . . . , L} . (22) We also define the largest and smallest singular values of the output of the first layer at initialization for each client as \u03b10,k := \u03c3min ( \u03c3 ( XkW 0 1,k )) . Similarly, for the centralized setting when all the clients share the same parameter and full data, we define \u03b10 := \u03c3min ( \u03c3 ( XW 01 )) . Initialization Strategy: Given any \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), we initialize the model weights such that for some constants M1,M2,M3 > 0, the following are satisfied M1 min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u2225X\u2225F \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u00b7 \u03a6(\u03b8 0) 3 2 \u03f5 \u2264 { 1 2 \u03bb, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, 1, l \u2208 {1, 2}, , (23) M2 min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u00b7 \u03a6(\u03b8 0) 3 2 \u03f5 \u2264 min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) , M3\u03bb3\u2192L\u03b10 \u2265 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l . (24) To satisfy the required initialization, we follow the initialization strategy of Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). First, randomly initialize [ W 01 ] ij \u223c N (0, 1/d2in). Broadcast [W 01 ]ij to each client and collect F1,k, which is the output of the first layer of each client, as well as the norm of local data \u2225Xk\u2225F . With F1,k, \u03b10 and \u03b10,k can be computed. For (23), since we have n1 > N , \u03b10 and \u03b10,k are strictly positive. Then it is easy to verify that given \u03f5 > 0, (23) and the second relation in (24) will be satisfied if we choose large enough \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l . This can be realized by choosing arbitrarily large \u03bb\u0304l, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}. In order to satisfy the first relation in (24), we need to make \u03bb\u0304l and \u03bbl close to each other. Intuitively, one way is to construct ( W 0l )L l=3 such that \u03bbl = \u03bb\u0304l = \u03b6 > 1, where \u03b6 can be chosen to be any large number such that (23) and the second relation in (24) are satisfied. We also need to upper bound \u03a6(\u03b80). This can be done by choosing small W 02 . Randomly initialize W 02 such that [ W 02 ] ij \u223c N (0, \u03ba). We can set \u03ba to be arbitrarily small, then \u03a6(\u03b80) is bounded by 2 N \u2225y\u2225 2 2 with high probability (see (10) in Nguyen and Mondelli (2020)). Note that the desired error \u03f5 is another key constant in the initialization. When we expect the error to be small, (23) and the second relation in (24) will be more strict. But this is not an issue since we can choose a larger \u03b6 such that the initial conditions are satisfied. The detailed initialization strategy that ensures that the conditions of Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied is given in the Appendix B.2. Next, let us state our main result, which indicates the linear convergence of local SGD to any \u03f5optimal solution (see Definition 1). The proof is attached in Appendix B.3. Theorem 1. Using FedAvg-SGD to minimize (3) with Algorithm 1. Suppose Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, then there exists an initialization strategy such that for any \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), there exists step-size \u03b7 > 0 such that we have (where \u00b5\u2032 := r2N \u03b3 2(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0, and \u03b7\u00b5 \u2032 < 1) E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7)t \u03a6(\u03b80), t \u2208 {0, . . . , T \u2212 1}. Theorem 1 shows that, for any \u03f5 > 0, we can always find an initialization, such that FedAvgSG achieves an \u03f5 accuracy within O ( log( 1\u03f5 ) ) rounds of communication. Notice that there is no heterogeneity assumption on the data (see Remark 2), and no assumption on the Lipschitz gradient of the loss function. Remark 5. We comment on the key novelties of this work compared to Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). (1) Our work requires a careful analysis to deal with multiple local updates at each client. Note that in contrast to Nguyen and Mondelli (2020), for our algorithm there is no guarantee that the overall objective will always decrease during local updates. In fact, our analysis demonstrates that the overall objective can increase after each local iteration, we show that this increase will be compensated by the descent in the objective value between each communication round. (2) Our algorithm and analysis can deal with the stochastic gradients for conducting local updates, while Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) only considered gradient descent in a centralized setting. A key step in our analysis is to characterize the relationship between the stochastic and full gradient updates, which is illustrated in Lemma 1. Remark 6. We comment on the choice of parameters and the convergence rate. As will be shown in Appendix B.3, by utilizing our initialization strategy, we can choose \u03b7 = c/\u00b5\u2032 for some constant c \u2208 (0, 1) (independent of \u03f5). This implies that \u00b5\u2032\u03b7 = c < 1, which further implies that we have (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7) < 1 in Theorem 1, ensuring linear convergence of FedAvg-SGD. Finally, we present the convergence guarantees for the case when FedAvg-GD is utilized. Corollary 1. Using FedAvg-GD to minimize (3) with Algorithm 1. Suppose Assumptions 2 and 3 are satisfied, then there exists an initialization strategy and step-size \u03b7 > 0, such that we have \u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1)) \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7)t \u03a6(\u03b80), \u2200t \u2208 {0, . . . , T \u2212 1}. (25) Remark 7. Corollary 1 implies that FedAvg-GD achieves linear convergence when optimizing (3). We note that the result of Corollary 1 is much stronger compared to Theorem 1 as the initialization for FedAvg-GD is independent of \u03f5 compared to the one for FedAvg-SGD (shown in Appendix B.2). 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we analyze the effect of increasing the network sizes on popular image classification tasks with MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. We compare the performance of FedAvg in both homogeneous (i.i.d.) and heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) data settings. Through our experiments we establish that larger sized networks uniformly outperform smaller networks under different settings. Next, we discuss the data and the model setting for our experiments. Data set: For MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets, we split the data set among K = 100 clients. For the homogeneous (i.i.d.) setting, we randomly distribute the complete data set with 60, 000 samples to each client. To model the heterogeneous (non i.i.d.) setting, we split the clients into two sets. One set of clients receive randomly drawn samples while the second set of clients receive data from only two out of ten labels McMahan et al. (2017). For our experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST data, 70% of the users receive non-i.i.d samples, while for CIFAR-10 data, the fraction is 20%. Results and Discussion For each setting, we compare the training loss and testing accuracy of FedAvg on smaller and larger sized networks. To analyze the effect of network sizes on the stability of FedAvg, we also plot the performance of FedAvg averaged over 10 iterations for non-i.i.d. client data setting for all the network architectures. From our experiments, we make a few observations. First, we observe from Figures 1 and 2 that in all the cases, the i.i.d setting has more stable performance (lower variance) than non-i.i.d setting. Second, we note that the larger network uniformly outperforms the smaller network under all the settings. Third, we note from the box plots in Figures 1 and 2 that the performance of the larger networks have lower variance, hence more stable performance compared with what can be achieved by the smaller networks. Finally, we compare the random initialization with special initialization strategy which satisfies (23), (24). We can conclude from Figure 3 that these two initialization are similar in test performance. APPENDIX:  A RELATED WORK: Overparameterized Neural Networks. The surprising performance of overparameterized neural networks has raised significant research interest in the ML community to analyze the phenomenon of overparameterization Belkin et al. (2019). Consequently, a number of works have analyzed the performance of centralized (stochastic) gradient descent (S)GD on overparameterized neural network architectures under different settings Jacot et al. (2018); Li and Liang (2018); Arora et al. (2019); Du et al. (2018; 2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Zou and Gu (2019); Nguyen and Mondelli (2020); Nguyen (2021). The authors in Jacot et al. (2018), showed that an infinite width neural network when trained using gradient descent (GD) behaves like a kernel method with the kernel defined as neural tangent kernel (NTK). Using this NTK parameterization Li and Liang (2018) showed that deep neural networks trained using GD require \u2126(N4) width to find the global optimal. This result was later improved to \u2126(N3) in Huang and Yau (2020). The authors in Du et al. (2018) and Du et al. (2019) also analyze the performance of GD on overparameterized neural networks under different settings. Under standard parameterization, the work Allen-Zhu et al. (2019) studied the convergence of SGD and showed that network width of \u2126(N24) suffices to guarantee linear convergence. Recently, Nguyen and Mondelli (2020) and Nguyen (2021) have improved the dependence on the width and have shown that GD requires only \u2126(N) width to achieve linear convergence. All the works mentioned above focus on the centralized setting, and therefore, do not deal with data heterogeneity problem. B PROOF OF MAIN RESULT:  B.1 PROOF OF LEMMAS: We define some additional notations before we state some lemmas which are needed in the proof. Let \u2297 denote the Kronecker product, and denote \u03a3l := diag [vec (\u03c3\u2032 (Fl\u22121Wl))] \u2208 RNnl\u00d7Nnl , \u03a3l,k := diag [vec (\u03c3\u2032 (Fl\u22121,kWl,k))] \u2208 RNknl\u00d7Nknl and \u03a3\u0303l,k := diag [ vec ( \u03c3\u2032 ( F\u0303l\u22121,kWl,k ))] \u2208 Rmnl\u00d7mnl . Define frt+vL,k := fL,k(\u03b8 rt+v k ), F rt+v L,k := FL,k(\u03b8 rt+v); frtL := fL(\u03b8\u0304 rt), F rtL := FL(\u03b8\u0304 rt+v), fL(\u03b8 rt+v) := vec(F rt+vL ). Lemma 4.

Let R = L\u220f p=1 max ( 1, \u039b\u0304p ) .

(29) provides an upper bound on the norm of output of each layer while (30) gives an upper bound on the norm of gradient of each layer; (32) derives the Lipschitz constant of the networks and (33) provides the Lipschitz constant for the Jacobian of each layer. Similar results can be derived in centralized optimization problem, so we do not include the results here. Lemma 5. (Nguyen and Mondelli, 2020, Lemma 4.3) Let f : Rn \u2192 R be a C2 function. Let x, y \u2208 Rn be given, and assume that \u2225\u2207f(z)\u2212\u2207f(x)\u22252 \u2264 C\u2225z\u2212 x\u22252 for every z = x+ t(y\u2212 x) with t \u2208 [0, 1]. Then, f(y) \u2264 f(x) + \u27e8\u2207f(x), y \u2212 x\u27e9+ C 2 \u2225x\u2212 y\u22252. Lemma 6. For constant C, \u00b5, \u03c1, if \u03b7 \u2192 0, we have lim \u03b7\u21920 \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 = e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 (34) Furthermore, given \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), let T = \u230a log(\u03a6(\u03b80)/\u03f5) log( 11\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 ) + 1 \u230b , then there exists constant \u03be, such that sup 0<\u03b7<min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ) (\u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 )T \u2264 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 , (35) where \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 is a constant dependent on \u03c1 and \u00b5. Proof. Take logarithm on both sides, we get log (\u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 ) = \u2212 log( \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) log(1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7) = \u22121 2 \u00b7 log(1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) log(1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7) (36) Now let \u03b7 \u2192 0, by L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s rule, take derivative over \u03b7, we have lim \u03b7\u21920 \u22121 2 \u00b7 log(1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) log(1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7) = lim \u03b7\u21920 1 2 \u00b7 3\u03c1C \u00b5C 1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 = 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 . (37) Next, if we can show the function of \u03b7, which is \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 , has a limit when \u03b7 \u2192 min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ), then by the continuity, it has an upper bound in ( 0,min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ) ) , denote it as \u03be. It is easy to derive that lim \u03b7\u2192min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C ) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 = lim \u03b7\u2192min( 1\u03c1 , 1 \u00b5 ) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1\u03b7 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5\u03b7 { 2 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5 \u03c1 , \u03c1 > \u00b5, 1, \u03c1 \u2264 \u00b5. Then by the continuity of the function, (\u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 ) 1 log 1 1\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 is bounded by some constant \u03be. Then we can derive sup \u03b7\u2208(0,min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C )) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 T \u2265 lim \u03b7\u21920 \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1\u03b7 log(\u03a6(\u03b80)/\u03f5) log 1 1\u2212\u00b5\u03b7 = e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 \u00b7 \u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 (38) then we have there exists some constant \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 , such that sup \u03b7\u2208(0,min( 1\u03c1C , 1 \u00b5C )) \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7 T \u2264 \u03be\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) \u03f5 . (39) Lemma 7. Let Assumption 2 and Assumption 3 hold. For \u03b8k, suppose there exists constant \u039b\u0304l, \u039bl, \u039bF such that and  \u03c3max(Wl,k) \u2264 \u039b\u0304l, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(Wl,k) \u2265 \u039bl, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min(F1,k) \u2265 \u039bF , k \u2208 [K]. (40) then we have \u03c1(\u03b8k) \u2264 LN \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF (41) Proof.

(42) Since by (31) and (28) in Lemma 4, we have \u2225g\u0303k\u22252 \u2264 L\u2225X\u0303k\u2225F m \u039b\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u039b\u0304l \u2225f\u0303L,k(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u0303\u22252, (43) \u2225g2,k\u22252 \u2265 1 Nk \u03b3L\u22122\u039b3\u2192L\u039bF \u2225fL,k(\u03b8)\u2212 y\u2225, (44) where Xk is the sampled data at \u03b8k.

B.2 INITIALIZATION STRATEGY Detailed Initialization for FedAvg-SGD: Denote P := L\u2225X\u2225F N ( 7 4 )L\u22121 (2r \u2212 1), C := PL\u2225X\u2225F ( 3 2 )L\u22121 \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l , (65) \u03c1 := LN\u2225X\u2225F 7L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192Lmin l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l m\u03b3L\u22122\u03bb3\u2192L min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) , (66) \u00b5 := r 2N2 \u03b3 2(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0 C . (67) Suppose given any small \u03f5 such that \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), the initialized weights satisfies the following conditions: 2N 3 2 L\u2225X\u2225F ( 32 )L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u00b7 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 \u221a 2\u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 { 1 2\u03bbl, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}, 1, l \u2208 {1, 2}. (68) 2N 3 2 L( 32 ) L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l \u00b7 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 \u221a 2\u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 1 2 min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) . (69) where \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 is some constant dependent on \u03c1 and \u00b5. Now we provide a detailed way to realize the above initialization condition. To satisfy the required initialization, we follow the initialization strategy of Nguyen and Mondelli (2020). First, randomly initialize [ W 01 ] ij \u223c N (0, 1/d2in). Broadcast [W 01 ]ij to each client and collect F1,k, which is the output of the first layer of each client, as well as the norm of local data \u2225Xk\u2225F and norm of local label \u2225yk\u22252. With F1,k, \u03b10 and \u03b10,k can be computed. For (23), since we have n1 > N , \u03b10 and \u03b10,k are strictly positive with probability 1. Then it is easy to verify that given \u03f5 > 0, (23) and the second relation in (24) will be satisfied if we choose large enough \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l . This can be realized by choosing arbitrarily large \u03bbl, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}. However, notice that by Lemma 6, the constant \u03be, which is defined in (39), is only dependent on \u03c1 and \u00b5 and \u03be \u2265 e 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 . So if we can fix \u03c1 and \u00b5 as some constants, \u03be is a bounded constant. Notice in (66) and (67), for l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L}, if we can make \u03bb\u0304l and \u03bbl close to each other, then \u03c1 and \u00b5 are also close, so 3\u03c1 2\u00b5 is not large. This is equivalent to the first relation in (24) in main text. In order to satisfy the above conditions, one way is to construct ( W 0l )L l=3 in such way that \u03bbl = \u03bb\u0304l = \u03b6 > 1, where \u03b6 can be chosen to be any large number such that (23) and the second relation in (24) are satisfied. Specifically, we can utilize the following construction: Initialize W 0l such that its top block is a scaled identity matrix and rest of entries are zero W 0l = [ \u03b6 \u00b7 Inl 0 ] \u2208 Rnl\u00d7nl\u22121 , l = 3, . . . , L. (70) We also need to upper bound \u03a6(\u03b80). This can be done by choosing small W 02 . Randomly initialize W 02 such that [ W 02 ] ij \u223c N (0, \u03ba). We can set \u03ba to be arbitrarily small, similar to (10) in Nguyen and Mondelli (2020),we can find a bound for \u03a6(\u03b80) with high probability:\u221a 2N\u03a6(\u03b80) = \u2225FL(\u03b80)\u2212 y\u2225F (71) \u2264 \u2225y\u22252 + \u2225\u2225FL (\u03b80)\u2225\u2225F \u2264 \u2225y\u22252 + L\u220f l=1 \u03c3max(W 0 l )\u2225X\u2225F \u2264 2\u2225y\u22252 (72) Then the loss function at initialization can be bounded by constant \u221a 2N\u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 2\u2225y\u22252. Initialization for FedAvg-GD: The initialized weight matrices satisfy the following conditions: 2N (( 3 2 )L\u22121 + 2L\u22121(r \u2212 1) ) \u2225X\u2225F r\u03b32(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121)2 2 3\u2192L\u03b1 2 0 \u00b7 \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u03bb\u0304l \u2264 { 1 2\u03bbl, l \u2208 {3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L} 1, l \u2208 {1, 2} (73) 2N (( 3 2 )L\u22121 + 2L\u22121(r \u2212 1) ) \u2225X\u22252F r\u03b32(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121)2 \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0 \u00b7 \u03bb\u03042\u2192L \u2264 1 2 \u03b10. (74) The initialization strategy is similar to FedAvg-SGD, so we omit the discussion here. B.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 1: Theorem 1. Using FedAvg-SGD to minimize (3) with Algorithm 1. Suppose Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied, then there exists an initialization strategy such that for any \u03f5 < \u03a6(\u03b80), there exists step-size \u03b7 > 0 such that we have E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304r(t+1))] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u2032\u03b7)t \u03a6(\u03b80), t \u2208 {0, . . . , T \u2212 1} (75) where \u00b5\u2032 = rN \u03b3 2(L\u22122) ( 1 2 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb23\u2192L\u03b1 2 0. Proof. First, we provide a structure of our proof. We will show the following recursively at each communication round: 1) The averaged weights are bounded at each communication round; 2) The divergence of loss function (3) is bounded at each communication round; 3) The expected loss function (3) decreases linearly at each communication round. Further, we will show that in each local epoch within a fixed communication round, we have: 1) The weights of each client are bounded; 2) The divergence of loss function \u03a6k of each client is bounded. Now let us set T = \u230a log(\u03a6(\u03b80)/\u03f5) log( 11\u2212\u00b5C\u03b7 ) + 1 \u230b . If we can show (75) holds for t = 0, . . . , T , then it is easy to show that E[\u03a6(\u03b8\u0304rT )] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7)T \u03a6(\u03b80) \u2264 \u03f5. We prove Theorem 1 by induction. Define \u03c1rt+v := sup k\u2208[K] q\u2208{0,1,...,v} \u03c1(\u03b8rt+qk ) \u03c1 := Lm\u2225X\u2225F 7L\u22121 \u03bb\u03041\u2192Lmin l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l N\u03b3L\u22122\u03bb3\u2192L min ( \u03b10, min k\u2208[K] \u03b10,k ) , (76) We show that \u2200t \u2264 T , we have \u03c3max ( W\u0304 ru ) \u2264 32 \u03bb\u0304l u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min ( W\u0304 ru ) \u2a7e 12\u03bbl, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 {3, . . . , L}, \u03c3min (F ru 1 ) \u2a7e 1 2\u03b10, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, \u03c3min ( F ru1,k ) \u2265 12\u03b10,k, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c1rt \u2264 \u03c1, \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru ) \u2a7d (1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7)u \u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru )] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7)u\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} . (77) where \u03bb\u0304l is defined in (22) and \u03bbl is the smallest eigen value of the weight matrix, C, \u00b5, \u03c1 defined in B.2 and \u00b5C = \u00b5\u2032. The above recursive equation describes the weight matrix and loss function in each communication round. To prove (77), we decompose the recursive equation into two steps, as follows Step1: For a fixed t and v \u2208 [r \u2212 1], given \u03c3max ( W\u0304l ru ) \u2a7d 32 \u03bb\u0304l, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min ( W\u0304l ru ) \u2a7e 12\u03bbl, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, l \u2208 [L], \u03c3min (F ru 1 ) \u2a7e 1 2\u03b10, u \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, \u03c1rt \u2264 \u03c1; \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru ) \u2264 (1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7)u\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} E [ \u03a6 ( \u03b8\u0304ru )] \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5C\u03b7)u\u03a6 ( \u03b80 ) , u \u2208 {0, . . . , t} \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+qk ) \u2264 (1 + 3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7)q\u03a6k (\u03b8rtk ) , q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c3max ( W rt+ql,k ) \u2264 74 \u03bb\u0304l, q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min ( W rt+ql,k ) \u2264 14\u03bbl, q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, l \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], \u03c3min ( F rt+q1,k ) \u2265 14\u03b10,k, q \u2208 {0, . . . , v \u2212 1}, k \u2208 [K], \u03c1rt+v\u22121 \u2264 \u03c1, .

So similarly we can derive the Lipschitz constant Qk = L \u221a L Nk ( 7 4 )2(L\u22121) \u2225Xk\u22252F \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l + L \u221a L Nk \u2225Xk\u2225F (1 + L\u03b2 \u2225Xk\u2225F R \u2032)R\u2032 \u2225\u2225f0L,k \u2212 yk\u2225\u22252 , (99) such that \u2200s \u2208 [0, 1],\u2225\u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121,sk \u2212 grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 Qk\u2225\u03b8rt+v\u22121,sk \u2212 \u03b8 rt+v\u22121 k \u22252. (100) With Lipschitz gradient within [\u03b8rt+v\u22121k , \u03b8 rt+v k ], by Lemma 5, we have \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u27e8\u2207\u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) , \u03b8rt+vk \u2212 \u03b8 rt+v k \u232a + Qk 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8rt+v\u22121k \u2212 \u03b8rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (101) = \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u2329 grt+v\u22121k ,\u2212\u03b7g\u0303 rt+v\u22121 k \u232a + Qk 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b7g\u0303rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (102) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u03b7 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u22252 \u2225\u2225g\u0303rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u22252 + Qk2 \u03b72 \u2225\u2225g\u0303rt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (103) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u03b7\u03c1 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 + Qk2 \u03b72\u03c12 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (104) Let \u03b7 < 1Qk\u03c1 , we have the above inequality \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + \u03b7\u03c1 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 + Qk2 \u03b72\u03c12 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (105) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) + 3 2 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2225\u2225grt+v\u22121k \u2225\u222522 (106) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vk ) + 3\u03c1\u03b7L Nk ( 7 4 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v\u22121k ) , (107) where the third inequality comes from (31) in Lemma 4. Recall C \u2032 := max k ( 1Nk ( 7 4 )2(L\u22121) \u03bb\u030421\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u03042l ), we have \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+v+1k ) \u2264 \u03a6k ( \u03b8rt+vN ) (1 + 3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7). (108) Now Step 1 is proved. Next we show Step 2. (1) Show { \u03c3max ( W\u0304 rul ) \u2a7d 32 \u03bb\u0304l, u \u2208 {0, 1, . . . t+ 1}, l \u2208 [L] \u03c3min ( W\u0304 rul ) \u2a7e 12 \u03bb\u0304l u \u2208 {0, 1, . . . t+ 1} l \u2208 {3, . . . , L} . (109) Define \u2207\u0303Wl,k\u03a6k(\u03b8rtk ) be the stochastic gradient over layer l of each client.

So by definition of \u03c1rt+v , we have \u2225g\u0303ru+v\u22252 \u2264 \u03c1\u2225gru+v\u22252. Then it is easy to verify that the assumptions in Lemma 8 are satisfied, where \u039b\u0304l = 74 \u03bb\u0304l, Qk is defined in (63) and A = 1+3\u03c1C \u2032\u03b7.

Now let S = \u221a 1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7, if we choose \u03b7 < 1\u03c1C , we get \u03b7 t\u2211 u=0 r\u22121\u2211 v=0 \u2225\u00af\u0303gru+v\u22252 \u2264 \u03b7\u03c1P \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l t\u2211 u=0 (1 + 3\u03c1C\u03b7) u 2 \u2225f0L \u2212 y\u22252 = \u03b7\u03c1P \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l t\u2211 u=0 Su\u2225f0L \u2212 y\u22252 \u2264 \u03b7\u03c1P \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l ST+1 S2 \u2212 1 (S + 1)\u2225f0L \u2212 y\u22252 = \u03b7\u03c1P \u03bb\u03041\u2192L min l\u2208[L] \u03bb\u0304l ST+1 \u00b7 3 3\u03c1C\u03b7 \u2225f0L \u2212 y\u22252 (118) By Lemma 6, we have ST \u2264 \u03be\u03a6(\u03b8 0) \u03f5 .

(153) Remark 8. To satisfy the initialization assumptions defined in (69) and (68), we initialize the neural network coefficients such that we have \u03bb\u03041\u2192L \u223c O(1/\u03f5). Note from the definition of \u00b5\u2032 in (152) that this implies \u00b5\u2032 \u223c O(\u03bb23\u2192L) = O(\u03bb\u030421\u2192L) = O(1/\u03f52). Also, note from the choice of step-size in (153) that, we have \u03b7 \u223c O(\u03f5 \u00d7 1/\u03bb\u03041\u2192L) = O(\u03f52). Note that this follows from the fact that \u03b7 is smaller than each quantity defined in (153) above. Thus, we have \u00b5\u2032\u03b7 = O(1) and we can always choose \u03b7 = c/\u00b5\u2032 for some c \u2208 (0, 1), which guarantees linear convergence of the objective in each communication round (see Theorem 1). C EXPERIMENT SETTING AND RESULT:  C.1 MODEL AND PARAMETER SETTINGS:: To analyze the performance of FedAvg-SGD on the MNIST data set, we use a single hidden-layer fully-connected neural network (MLP) with ReLU activation. We set the hidden-layer size to be 32 (resp. 1, 000) for the small (resp. large) network. We choose the mini-batch size m = 10 and choose the number of local steps to be r = 10. Using the above network, we also compare the random initialization with the special initialization strategy in (23),(24) with MNIST and Fashion MNIST dataset. For the CIFAR-10 data set, we analyze the performance of FedAvg-SGD on two network architectures \u2013 convolutional neural network (CNN) and ResNet. We design the smaller CNN using two 5 \u00d7 5 convolutional layers followed by 2 \u00d7 2 max pooling, each has 6 and 16 channels, connected by 2 fully-connected layers with 120 and 84 hidden neurons. For larger CNN, we use three 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layers each with 128 channels followed by 2 \u00d7 2 max pooling. The ReLU activation function is used after each hidden layer for small/large CNN. For ResNet, we compare the performance on ResNet18 with ResNet50 architectures. For both the CNN and ResNet, we use a mini-batch size of m = 32 and number of local steps to be r = 5. We randomly sample 10 clients in each epoch and perform FedAvg-SGD for more efficient training.

This is a challenging problem due to the non-convexity of neural networks and the heterogeneity inherent in federated learning. To achieve this, the paper almost certainly relies heavily on the **Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)** theory, which effectively linearizes the neural network's behavior when it is sufficiently wide and initialized appropriately. The rigor of the paper will depend critically on how robustly these NTK-based assumptions are applied and how the specific challenges of FedAvg (local updates, aggregation, data heterogeneity) are integrated into this framework.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Mathematical Soundness of Proofs**\\n\\nThe core of the paper's contribution will lie in its proofs. Here's a breakdown of areas to scrutinize for mathematical soundness:\\n\\n*   **Reliance on NTK Theory:**\\n    *   **NTK Constancy:** The most critical step. For the network to behave linearly, the NTK $\\\\Theta(w)$ must remain approximately constant throughout training, typically approximated by $\\\\Theta(w_0)$ (the NTK at initialization). The proof must rigorously show that weights do not drift too far from initialization, even with local updates over multiple epochs and communication rounds. This often requires small learning rates ($\\\\eta_l, \\\\eta_g$) and sufficiently large width ($m$).\\n    *   **Positive Definiteness/Invertibility of NTK:** For linear convergence to a unique solution, the NTK $\\\\Theta(w_0)$ must be positive definite (or at least its minimum eigenvalue must be bounded away from zero). The proof must establish this, usually under conditions on network architecture, initialization scheme, and data distribution.\\n    *   **Bounded Norm of Gradients/Jacobians:** Proofs often involve bounding $\\\\|\\\\nabla f(w)\\\\|$ or $\\\\|\\\\nabla_w f(w,x)\\\\|$ which are related to the Jacobian of the network output with respect to weights. These bounds need to be carefully derived and should not explode with depth or width.\\n\\n*   **Handling Non-Convexity:**\\n    *   **Effective Convexity:** The NTK framework essentially transforms the non-convex optimization problem into an \\\"effectively convex\\\" one in the parameter space around initialization. The proof must clearly articulate how this transformation works and the conditions under which it holds. It's not truly global convexity, but rather a local \\\"strong convexity\\\" around the initialization point when viewed through the lens of the NTK.\\n    *   **Zero Training Loss:** Proving convergence to zero *training* loss is plausible in overparameterized NNs due to their interpolation capabilities. However, the proof must show that FedAvg's process (local updates + averaging) does not hinder this interpolation, but rather facilitates it.\\n\\n*   **Federated Learning Specifics:**\\n    *   **Local Update Analysis:** Each client performs $E$ steps of local optimization (e.g., GD). The proof must analyze the change in local weights $\\\\Delta w_k$ and the corresponding reduction in local loss. This analysis often needs to show that local updates bring clients closer to *their local minimum* while also aligning with the *global minimum* (or the direction towards it).\\n    *   **Impact of Aggregation:** The global averaging step is crucial. The proof must show how this averaging effectively reduces the divergence caused by heterogeneous local updates and pulls the global model towards the shared interpolating solution.\\n    *   **Data Heterogeneity (Non-IID):** This is the biggest challenge in FL. The proof needs to rigorously bound the variance or discrepancy arising from clients having different data distributions. Common strategies include:\\n        *   Bounding the difference between local gradients and the global average gradient: $\\\\|\\\\nabla \\\\mathcal{L}_k(w) - \\\\nabla \\\\mathcal{L}(w)\\\\|$.\\n        *   Assuming bounded local dissimilarity or gradient similarity.\\n        *   Showing that the averaging step sufficiently mitigates the heterogeneity-induced drift.\\n        *   The rate will likely depend on some measure of data heterogeneity (e.g., the maximum difference between client-specific loss functions).\\n    *   **Communication Rounds ($T$):** The linear convergence rate will typically be expressed as $(1-\\\\rho)^T$, where $\\\\rho$ is the contraction factor. The proof must derive $\\\\rho$ in terms of model parameters, learning rates, number of clients, local epochs, and heterogeneity.\\n\\n*   **Convergence Rate Derivation:**\\n    *   **Lyapunov Function:** A common technique is to define a Lyapunov function (e.g., the squared distance to the interpolating solution $w^*$) and show that it decreases geometrically at each communication round.\\n    *   **Contraction Mapping:** Show that the FedAvg update rule acts as a contraction mapping in the parameter space (or a transformed space via NTK).\\n    *   **Explicit Constant:** The derived constant $\\\\rho$ must be explicit and clearly show its dependencies on various parameters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Validity of Assumptions**\\n\\nThe validity of the paper's claims hinges directly on the realism and restrictiveness of its underlying assumptions.\\n\\n*   **Overparameterization:**\\n    *   **\\\"Sufficiently Wide\\\":** This is a recurring assumption in NTK theory. The paper must quantify *how* wide is \\\"sufficiently wide.\\\" This typically means width $m$ must be polynomial in $N$ (number of data points), depth $L$, and feature dimension $d$. For practical deep networks, these required widths can be astronomically large, making the theoretical guarantees less applicable to typical models.\\n    *   **Relationship between Width, Depth, and NTK:** The precise conditions for the NTK to be positive definite and constant often depend on the interaction between network width and depth. For very deep networks, even with large width, the NTK theory becomes more complex or requires even stronger assumptions.\\n\\n*   **NTK Regime Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Small Perturbations:** The assumption that weights remain close to initialization is crucial for $\\\\Theta(w_t) \\\\approx \\\\Theta(w_0)$. This implicitly limits the total number of communication rounds, local steps, or learning rates. If training goes on for too long or learning rates are too large, the network might escape the NTK regime, and the linear convergence guarantee could break down.\\n    *   **Initialization Scheme:** Standard Gaussian or Kaiming/Glorot initialization schemes (scaled appropriately by $1/\\\\sqrt{m}$) are usually assumed to ensure the NTK properties hold.\\n\\n*   **Data Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Interpolation Property:** The existence of a $w^*$ such that $f(w^*, x_i) = y_i$ for all training data points $i$. This is generally true for sufficiently overparameterized NNs but assumes the training data is perfectly representable by the model.\\n    *   **Bounded Gradients/Smoothness:** Standard $L$-smoothness (Lipschitz continuous gradients) is a common assumption in optimization theory. This is generally reasonable for NNs with common activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).\\n    *   **Heterogeneity Characterization:** How is the non-IID nature of the data modeled? Is it bounded variance of local gradients around the global mean? Is it a bounded difference in local loss functions? The strength of the convergence guarantee will depend on how precisely this heterogeneity is characterized and bounded. Strong assumptions on data similarity between clients would weaken the practical relevance for highly heterogeneous settings.\\n\\n*   **Learning Rates and Local Steps:**\\n    *   **Small Learning Rates:** The analysis often requires learning rates ($\\\\eta_l, \\\\eta_g$) to be sufficiently small to maintain the NTK regime and ensure stability. This might clash with empirical observations where larger learning rates are often beneficial.\\n    *   **Number of Local Steps ($E$):** The choice of $E$ is critical. If $E$ is too large, local models might diverge significantly from the global average, potentially violating the NTK assumptions or increasing the heterogeneity-induced variance. If $E$ is too small, communication costs dominate.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Tightness of Convergence Bounds**\\n\\nThe tightness of the bounds determines how well the theoretical rate reflects the actual performance.\\n\\n*   **Dependency on Width ($m$):** The convergence rate should generally improve with $m$ (e.g., faster convergence as $m \\\\to \\\\infty$). The bounds should reflect this, possibly via $\\\\lambda_{\\\\min}(\\\\Theta(w_0))$ which typically grows with $m$.\\n*   **Dependency on Number of Clients ($K$):** For full client participation, $K$ plays a role in averaging variance. For partial participation, the sampling mechanism and its impact on variance must be included.\\n*   **Dependency on Local Steps ($E$):** There's often a sweet spot for $E$. The bound should accurately capture the trade-off: too small $E$ means slow local progress, too large $E$ can lead to divergence from global goal due to heterogeneity.\\n*   **Heterogeneity Term:** This is where tightness is most important. A common bound for non-IID data includes terms related to the average squared difference between local gradients and the global gradient. If this term is too loose, the bound might suggest much slower convergence than observed or might not capture the sensitivity to highly non-IID data.\\n*   **Optimal vs. General Bounds:** Is the derived rate optimal for FedAvg under these assumptions, or is it a more general upper bound? Compared to centralized NTK results, the FedAvg bound should ideally be similar, but with multiplicative or additive factors arising from communication and heterogeneity.\\n*   **Hidden Constants:** Are there large constants hidden in the big-O notation? These can make a theoretically linear rate practically slow. For instance, the constant $\\\\rho$ might depend on quantities that scale poorly with depth or data dimension.\\n*   **Comparison to Empirical Observations:** While this is a theoretical paper, it's worth considering if the derived rate aligns qualitatively with empirical results for FedAvg on overparameterized NNs. Discrepancies might indicate overly strong assumptions or loose bounds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Potential Flaws, Inconsistencies, and Areas for Improvement**\\n\\n*   **Generalizability Beyond NTK Regime:** The main limitation of NTK-based results is their applicability. While they provide rigorous guarantees, they apply to a very specific, linearized behavior of NNs, which may not capture the full power or practical success of deep learning (where non-linearity and feature learning are crucial). The paper should explicitly acknowledge that the linear convergence is observed in this specific regime.\\n*   **Zero Training Loss vs. Generalization:** The paper focuses on *training* loss. Overparameterized NNs can achieve zero training loss by interpolating noise. The paper should clearly state that this result does not imply good *test* accuracy or generalization, and possibly discuss future work towards analyzing generalization in this federated NTK context.\\n*   **Practicality of \\\"Sufficiently Wide\\\":** While mathematically valid, the required width $m$ for the NTK assumptions to hold might be impractically large for many real-world scenarios. It would be beneficial if the paper discussed the implications of this width requirement for practical deployments.\\n*   **Robustness to Hyperparameter Choices:** The proofs often rely on very specific choices of learning rates and numbers of local epochs. How robust are the results to deviations from these ideal settings?\\n*   **Client Sampling:** If FedAvg involves partial client participation (i.e., only a subset of clients participate in each round), the variance introduced by client sampling needs to be carefully addressed in the proofs. This adds another layer of complexity to the bounds.\\n*   **Specific Architecture Limitations:** Does the result hold for *any* multi-layer NN, or is it specific to certain activation functions (e.g., ReLU) or architectures (e.g., fully connected vs. convolutional)? The scope should be clearly defined.\\n*   **Alternative Explanations:** While the NTK provides a clear mathematical path, it's worth considering if other phenomena (e.g., implicit regularization, loss landscape geometry in non-NTK regimes) could also contribute to FedAvg's convergence. The paper might be too narrow in its focus if it dismisses these.\\n\\nIn summary, a rigorous assessment of this paper would involve a deep dive into the specific mathematical constructions used to bridge the non-convexity of NNs with the heterogeneity of FL, primarily through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel. The devil will be in the details of how strictly assumptions are enforced and how tightly the bounds capture the complexities of the federated learning setting.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9467256\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"TheoreticalRigorAssessor\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed assessment of the theoretical rigor of the paper, 'FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly: The Power of Overparameterized Multi-Layer Neural Networks'.

It\\'s not truly global convexity, but rather a local \"strong convexity\" around the initialization point when viewed through the lens of the NTK.\\n    *   **Zero Training Loss:** Proving convergence to zero *training* loss is plausible in overparameterized NNs due to their interpolation capabilities. However, the proof must show that FedAvg\\'s process (local updates + averaging) does not hinder this interpolation, but rather facilitates it.\\n\\n*   **Federated Learning Specifics:**\\n    *   **Local Update Analysis:** Each client performs $E$ steps of local optimization (e.g., GD). The proof must analyze the change in local weights $\\\\Delta w_k$ and the corresponding reduction in local loss. This analysis often needs to show that local updates bring clients closer to *their local minimum* while also aligning with the *global minimum* (or the direction towards it).\\n    *   **Impact of Aggregation:** The global averaging step is crucial. The proof must show how this averaging effectively reduces the divergence caused by heterogeneous local updates and pulls the global model towards the shared interpolating solution.\\n    *   **Data Heterogeneity (Non-IID):** This is the biggest challenge in FL. The proof needs to rigorously bound the variance or discrepancy arising from clients having different data distributions. Common strategies include:\\n        *   Bounding the difference between local gradients and the global average gradient: $\\\\|\\\\nabla \\\\mathcal{L}_k(w) - \\\\nabla \\\\mathcal{L}(w)\\\\|$.\\n        *   Assuming bounded local dissimilarity or gradient similarity.\\n        *   Showing that the averaging step sufficiently mitigates the heterogeneity-induced drift.\\n        *   The rate will likely depend on some measure of data heterogeneity (e.g., the maximum difference between client-specific loss functions).\\n    *   **Communication Rounds ($T$):** The linear convergence rate will typically be expressed as $(1-\\\\rho)^T$, where $\\\\rho$ is the contraction factor. The proof must derive $\\\\rho$ in terms of model parameters, learning rates, number of clients, local epochs, and heterogeneity.\\n\\n*   **Convergence Rate Derivation:**\\n    *   **Lyapunov Function:** A common technique is to define a Lyapunov function (e.g., the squared distance to the interpolating solution $w^*$) and show that it decreases geometrically at each communication round.\\n    *   **Contraction Mapping:** Show that the FedAvg update rule acts as a contraction mapping in the parameter space (or a transformed space via NTK).\\n    *   **Explicit Constant:** The derived constant $\\\\rho$ must be explicit and clearly show its dependencies on various parameters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Validity of Assumptions**\\n\\nThe validity of the paper\\'s claims hinges directly on the realism and restrictiveness of its underlying assumptions.\\n\\n*   **Overparameterization:**\\n    *   **\"Sufficiently Wide\":** This is a recurring assumption in NTK theory. The paper must quantify *how* wide is \"sufficiently wide.\" This typically means width $m$ must be polynomial in $N$ (number of data points), depth $L$, and feature dimension $d$. For practical deep networks, these required widths can be astronomically large, making the theoretical guarantees less applicable to typical models.\\n    *   **Relationship between Width, Depth, and NTK:** The precise conditions for the NTK to be positive definite and constant often depend on the interaction between network width and depth. For very deep networks, even with large width, the NTK theory becomes more complex or requires even stronger assumptions.\\n\\n*   **NTK Regime Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Small Perturbations:** The assumption that weights remain close to initialization is crucial for $\\\\Theta(w_t) \\\\approx \\\\Theta(w_0)$. This implicitly limits the total number of communication rounds, local steps, or learning rates. If training goes on for too long or learning rates are too large, the network might escape the NTK regime, and the linear convergence guarantee could break down.\\n    *   **Initialization Scheme:** Standard Gaussian or Kaiming/Glorot initialization schemes (scaled appropriately by $1/\\\\sqrt{m}$) are usually assumed to ensure the NTK properties hold.\\n\\n*   **Data Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Interpolation Property:** The existence of a $w^*$ such that $f(w^*, x_i) = y_i$ for all training data points $i$. This is generally true for sufficiently overparameterized NNs but assumes the training data is perfectly representable by the model.\\n    *   **Bounded Gradients/Smoothness:** Standard $L$-smoothness (Lipschitz continuous gradients) is a common assumption in optimization theory. This is generally reasonable for NNs with common activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).\\n    *   **Heterogeneity Characterization:** How is the non-IID nature of the data modeled? Is it bounded variance of local gradients around the global mean? Is it a bounded difference in local loss functions? The strength of the convergence guarantee will depend on how precisely this heterogeneity is characterized and bounded. Strong assumptions on data similarity between clients would weaken the practical relevance for highly heterogeneous settings.\\n\\n*   **Learning Rates and Local Steps:**\\n    *   **Small Learning Rates:** The analysis often requires learning rates ($\\\\eta_l, \\\\eta_g$) to be sufficiently small to maintain the NTK regime and ensure stability. This might clash with empirical observations where larger learning rates are often beneficial.\\n    *   **Number of Local Steps ($E$):** The choice of $E$ is critical. If $E$ is too large, local models might diverge significantly from the global average, potentially violating the NTK assumptions or increasing the heterogeneity-induced variance. If $E$ is too small, communication costs dominate.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Tightness of Convergence Bounds**\\n\\nThe tightness of the bounds determines how well the theoretical rate reflects the actual performance.\\n\\n*   **Dependency on Width ($m$):** The convergence rate should generally improve with $m$ (e.g., faster convergence as $m \\\\to \\\\infty$). The bounds should reflect this, possibly via $\\\\lambda_{\\\\min}(\\\\Theta(w_0))$ which typically grows with $m$.\\n*   **Dependency on Number of Clients ($K$):** For full client participation, $K$ plays a role in averaging variance. For partial participation, the sampling mechanism and its impact on variance must be included.\\n*   **Dependency on Local Steps ($E$):** There\\'s often a sweet spot for $E$. The bound should accurately capture the trade-off: too small $E$ means slow local progress, too large $E$ can lead to divergence from global goal due to heterogeneity.\\n*   **Heterogeneity Term:** This is where tightness is most important. A common bound for non-IID data includes terms related to the average squared difference between local gradients and the global gradient. If this term is too loose, the bound might suggest much slower convergence than observed or might not capture the sensitivity to highly non-IID data.\\n*   **Optimal vs. General Bounds:** Is the derived rate optimal for FedAvg under these assumptions, or is it a more general upper bound? Compared to centralized NTK results, the FedAvg bound should ideally be similar, but with multiplicative or additive factors arising from communication and heterogeneity.\\n*   **Hidden Constants:** Are there large constants hidden in the big-O notation? These can make a theoretically linear rate practically slow. For instance, the constant $\\\\rho$ might depend on quantities that scale poorly with depth or data dimension.\\n*   **Comparison to Empirical Observations:** While this is a theoretical paper, it\\'s worth considering if the derived rate aligns qualitatively with empirical results for FedAvg on overparameterized NNs. Discrepancies might indicate overly strong assumptions or loose bounds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Potential Flaws, Inconsistencies, and Areas for Improvement**\\n\\n*   **Generalizability Beyond NTK Regime:** The main limitation of NTK-based results is their applicability. While they provide rigorous guarantees, they apply to a very specific, linearized behavior of NNs, which may not capture the full power or practical success of deep learning (where non-linearity and feature learning are crucial). The paper should explicitly acknowledge that the linear convergence is observed in this specific regime.\\n*   **Zero Training Loss vs. Generalization:** The paper focuses on *training* loss. Overparameterized NNs can achieve zero training loss by interpolating noise. The paper should clearly state that this result does not imply good *test* accuracy or generalization, and possibly discuss future work towards analyzing generalization in this federated NTK context.\\n*   **Practicality of \"Sufficiently Wide\":** While mathematically valid, the required width $m$ for the NTK assumptions to hold might be impractically large for many real-world scenarios. It would be beneficial if the paper discussed the implications of this width requirement for practical deployments.\\n*   **Robustness to Hyperparameter Choices:** The proofs often rely on very specific choices of learning rates and numbers of local epochs. How robust are the results to deviations from these ideal settings?\\n*   **Client Sampling:** If FedAvg involves partial client participation (i.e., only a subset of clients participate in each round), the variance introduced by client sampling needs to be carefully addressed in the proofs. This adds another layer of complexity to the bounds.\\n*   **Specific Architecture Limitations:** Does the result hold for *any* multi-layer NN, or is it specific to certain activation functions (e.g., ReLU) or architectures (e.g., fully connected vs. convolutional)? The scope should be clearly defined.\\n*   **Alternative Explanations:** While the NTK provides a clear mathematical path, it\\'s worth considering if other phenomena (e.g., implicit regularization, loss landscape geometry in non-NTK regimes) could also contribute to FedAvg\\'s convergence. The paper might be too narrow in its focus if it dismisses these.\\n\\nIn summary, a rigorous assessment of this paper would involve a deep dive into the specific mathematical constructions used to bridge the non-convexity of NNs with the heterogeneity of FL, primarily through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel.

While theoretically insightful, its practical applicability in real-world federated learning environments warrants a careful assessment.\\n\\n### Practical Applicability Assessment:\\n\\n**1. Complexity of the Initialization Strategy:**\\n\\nThe analysis of neural networks, especially in the context of linear convergence, often relies heavily on the **Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime**. This regime typically requires:\\n*   **\\\"Infinitely\\\" Wide Networks:** For the network's behavior to be well-approximated by its linearization around initialization, the hidden layers must be extremely wide.\\n*   **Specific Initialization Schemes:** Weights are usually initialized independently from a Gaussian distribution with specific variances (e.g., small weights leading to an Identity NTK or similar properties). This ensures that the network operates in a regime where its training dynamics are essentially linear in the parameter space, with the kernel remaining almost constant.\\n\\n**Practical Implications:**\\n*   **Deviation from Standard Practice:** While standard initializations (e.g., Kaiming, Xavier) are designed to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients, they might not strictly satisfy the conditions required for the NTK regime to hold throughout training, especially with finite-width networks and aggressive learning rates.\\n*   **Global vs. Local Initialization:** In FL, clients typically start with a global model (which might be randomly initialized or pre-trained). For the NTK theory to hold globally, all clients must start from an initialization that ensures their local NTKs are sufficiently \\\"aligned\\\" or behave predictably across diverse local datasets. This might be difficult to guarantee or verify.\\n*   **Fine-tuning Scenarios:** If FL is used for fine-tuning pre-trained models, the initial state is far from a typical random initialization, and the NTK theory might not apply at all.\\n\\nIn essence, while the paper's theoretical framework relies on a specific initialization for its proofs, ensuring this regime holds *practically* across diverse clients in an FL setup (especially with varying data distributions and finite-width networks) adds a layer of complexity and potential fragility.\\n\\n**2. Limitations Imposed by the Assumptions:**\\n\\nThe theoretical guarantees are often contingent upon several strong assumptions that may not hold in realistic FL scenarios:\\n\\n*   **Extreme Overparameterization:** The core assumption is that networks are \\\"overparameterized,\\\" often implying they are sufficiently wide to operate in the NTK regime. The degree of overparameterization required for *linear* convergence to zero training loss might be far beyond what is computationally feasible or necessary for good generalization in practice. Modern deep learning models are overparameterized, but rarely to the extent required for the NTK to truly dominate their learning dynamics.\\n*   **NTK Regime Implication:** Operating strictly in the NTK regime implies that the network's learning is primarily linear in feature space, and the features themselves (the kernel) are largely fixed from initialization. This contradicts the very motivation for using deep neural networks: their ability to learn complex, hierarchical, and *nonlinear* features. If a model strictly operates in the NTK regime, it might simply be learning a linear classifier on randomly fixed high-dimensional features, potentially limiting its expressive power and generalization capabilities compared to a model that truly leverages its depth and non-linearity.\\n*   **Zero Training Loss Target:** The paper focuses on convergence to \\\"zero training loss.\\\" While a desirable theoretical property, practical machine learning prioritizes **generalization performance** (test accuracy/loss) rather than achieving perfect fit on training data. Reaching zero training loss can even indicate overfitting, especially when operating strictly in the NTK regime where the model's capacity might be extremely high.\\n*   **Data Homogeneity (Often Implicit):** Many strong convergence guarantees, even for FedAvg, implicitly assume that client data distributions are statistically similar (IID). Realistic federated learning is characterized by **significant data heterogeneity (Non-IID)** across clients. When data is non-IID, the local gradients can vary drastically, potentially leading to client drift, slower convergence, or even divergence, and the global model might not converge to a meaningful optimum or struggle to generalize across diverse client distributions. The NTK for different clients' data could be vastly different, breaking the global coherence needed for the proof.\\n*   **Full Client Participation & Synchronicity:** Theoretical analyses often assume all clients participate in every round and communicate synchronously. Real-world FL encounters client dropouts, communication failures, and often uses asynchronous updates.\\n*   **Ignoring Communication Costs:** The convergence rate often reflects computation per round but typically doesn't explicitly factor in the cost of communication, which is a major bottleneck in FL.\\n*   **Noisier Gradients:** The analysis assumes well-behaved gradients. In practice, local SGD introduces noise, and heterogeneous data exacerbates this.\\n\\n**3. Potential Impact on Performance in Realistic Scenarios:**\\n\\nGiven the aforementioned limitations:\\n\\n*   **Generalization Gap:** Even if FedAvg *could* converge to zero training loss linearly under these assumptions, there's no guarantee this translates to improved generalization on unseen data, especially with finite capacity models or non-IID data. The NTK regime might lead to models that overfit their training data without learning robust, transferable features.\\n*   **Suboptimal Models:** If the model is forced into an NTK-like regime due to its width, it might not fully exploit the power of deep learning to learn complex features, leading to suboptimal performance compared to a more \\\"feature-learning\\\" regime.\\n*   **Fragility to Heterogeneity:** The biggest challenge is non-IID data. The theoretical guarantees of linear convergence are highly unlikely to hold, or the convergence rate would be drastically slower, when client data distributions diverge. The average NTK across heterogeneous clients might not behave predictably or stably.\\n*   **Computational Burden:** Requiring extremely overparameterized models can make them prohibitively expensive to train on resource-constrained edge devices, defeating a core purpose of FL.\\n*   **Lack of Transferability:** The insights might not transfer well to other FL algorithms (e.g., those designed for personalization, robustness, or communication efficiency) or different model architectures (e.g., transformers, CNNs outside of simple classification tasks) if they do not strongly adhere to the NTK assumptions.\\n\\n### Feasibility and Scalability:\\n\\n*   **Feasibility (Practical Deployment):**\\n    *   **Low:** For general, real-world FL deployments, strict adherence to the assumptions (especially infinite width and homogeneity) makes the approach largely *infeasible* if one strictly relies on the linear convergence guarantees presented. The theory describes an ideal scenario that is rarely met.\\n    *   **Moderate (as a guiding principle):** As a guiding principle, the idea that overparameterization *can* improve convergence stability in FedAvg is valuable. Many practical models are already overparameterized to some degree, and this paper provides a theoretical underpinning for why that might be beneficial, even if the strict linear convergence doesn't hold.\\n\\n*   **Scalability:**\\n    *   **Model Size (Poor):** If \\\"overparameterized\\\" means *extremely* wide (as often implied by NTK theory), then scalability with respect to model size is poor. Larger models require more memory, computation on client devices, and significantly more communication bandwidth for transmitting model updates. This directly conflicts with the resource constraints of many FL clients.\\n    *   **Number of Clients (Conditional):** The *proof* structure might scale with the number of clients in the sense that the averaging mechanism itself is scalable. However, the *assumptions* (e.g., homogeneity, ability to maintain NTK regime across many diverse clients) become increasingly difficult to satisfy as the number of clients and the heterogeneity of their data increases. This makes the *practical benefits* of this theoretical guarantee less scalable with the number of diverse clients.\\n\\n### Constructive Feedback and Recommendations:\\n\\n1.  **Relaxing Assumptions:** Future work should focus on relaxing the stringent assumptions, particularly regarding the degree of overparameterization (finite-width analysis), data homogeneity (non-IID analysis), and the strict NTK regime. Investigating how the convergence characteristics degrade gracefully as these assumptions are relaxed would be highly valuable.\\n2.  **Connecting to Generalization:** Explore the relationship between achieving zero training loss in the NTK regime and actual generalization performance on unseen data. Does this linear convergence translate to faster attainment of a good test accuracy?\\n3.  **Empirical Validation on Realistic Benchmarks:** Rigorous empirical validation on diverse federated learning benchmarks, featuring varying degrees of non-IID data, different model sizes (beyond the \\\"extreme\\\" overparameterization), and realistic communication constraints, would be crucial to assess the practical impact of these theoretical insights.\\n4.  **Beyond FedAvg:** Investigate if the insights from overparameterization and the NTK regime can inform the design of *new* FL algorithms that are more robust to heterogeneity or communication constraints, rather than just analyzing FedAvg.\\n5.  **Practical Guidelines:** Can these theoretical insights lead to practical guidelines for model architects in FL? For instance, what's a \\\"sweet spot\\\" for overparameterization that offers some convergence benefits without incurring excessive computational or communication costs?\\n6.  **Alternative Paradigms:** Consider if the analysis changes when clients perform more sophisticated local training steps (e.g., multiple epochs of local SGD) or when personalization techniques are employed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a powerful theoretical advancement by extending linear convergence guarantees to overparameterized deep networks in a federated setting. However, its practical applicability is significantly limited by the stringent assumptions, particularly concerning extreme overparameterization, the NTK regime, and data homogeneity. While the insights can guide our understanding of deep learning dynamics in FL, directly applying the derived guarantees to most real-world federated deployments is currently challenging due to the gap between theoretical idealizations and practical constraints.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.94246655\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please assess the practical applicability of the paper, 'FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly: The Power of Overparameterized Multi-Layer Neural Networks'.

The metrics (log-loss plots) are appropriate for visualizing linear convergence.\\n*   **Key Parameters:** The paper typically defines the key FedAvg parameters:\\n    *   `K`: Total number of clients.\\n    *   `C`: Fraction of clients selected per round.\\n    *   `E`: Number of local epochs/iterations.\\n    *   `B`: Local batch size.\\n    *   Learning Rate (`\u03b7`).\\n    *   Model Architecture (crucially, *overparameterized*).\\n*   **Overparameterization:** This is the central concept. The paper needs to clearly define how \\\"overparameterized\\\" is achieved and verified in the experiments. This is often done by using models with a large number of parameters relative to the dataset size, or by specifically increasing width/depth until the overparameterized regime is reached.\\n    *   **Strength:** If they show a clear distinction between underparameterized and overparameterized models regarding linear convergence to zero loss, this strengthens the claim.\\n    *   **Potential Weakness/Area for Improvement:** How sensitive is this linear convergence to the *degree* of overparameterization? Is \\\"just enough\\\" overparameterization sufficient, or does it require massive overparameterization? This might not be fully explored.\\n*   **Local Training:** The choice of local optimizers (e.g., SGD) and their parameters (local learning rate, momentum) needs to be consistent and clearly stated.\\n*   **Initialization:** Standard weight initialization schemes (e.g., Kaiming, Xavier) are usually employed. The use of random seeds for reproducibility is important, though often only a single seed is reported in figures.\\n\\n### **2. Choice of Datasets**\\n\\n*   **Standard Benchmarks:**\\n    *   **Strength:** Typically, papers use standard datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and potentially CIFAR-100. This is good as it allows for comparability with other research.\\n    *   **Relevance to Federated Learning:** These datasets are primarily chosen for their simplicity and common use, rather than their intrinsic properties for FL.\\n*   **Data Distribution (IID vs. Non-IID):** This is **CRITICAL** for Federated Learning.\\n    *   **Strength (if applicable):** If the paper demonstrates its claims on *both* IID and various degrees of non-IID data (e.g., using Dirichlet distribution for partitioning, or pathological non-IID splits), it significantly enhances the credibility. Non-IID data is the norm in real-world FL.\\n    *   **Potential Weakness/Bias:** If the experiments are predominantly or solely conducted on IID data, it severely limits the generalizability of the findings to real-world FL scenarios where data is inherently non-IID across clients. The theoretical guarantees might rely on assumptions that are closer to IID, and practical convergence on non-IID data is often much more challenging. The paper's strong claim needs to hold up under this stress.\\n*   **Dataset Scale:** The chosen datasets are relatively small. While this helps with quick experimentation, it might not fully reflect the challenges of overparameterization and convergence on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet, large language model training).\\n\\n### **3. Comparison with Existing Methods**\\n\\n*   **Focus of Comparison:** Given the paper's title and core claim (linear convergence to *zero training loss*), the primary comparison should ideally be:\\n    *   **Different FedAvg hyperparameters:** How `C`, `E`, `B`, and learning rate affect the linear convergence.\\n    *   **Overparameterized vs. Underparameterized models:** This is essential to show that overparameterization is indeed key to the observed phenomenon.\\n    *   **Centralized Training Baseline:** Comparing against centralized training can provide a useful upper bound on performance and reveal the \\\"cost\\\" (in terms of communication rounds or total compute) of distributed training.\\n*   **Comparison against other FL Algorithms:**\\n    *   **Potential Weakness/Bias:** Often, papers with strong theoretical claims about *one specific aspect* (like training loss convergence) might not extensively compare against state-of-the-art FL algorithms (e.g., FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedAdam, MOCHA). While the paper's claim is specific to FedAvg, it would strengthen the practical relevance to show if this linear convergence translates to competitive test accuracy or if other methods achieve similar or better performance with different convergence characteristics.\\n    *   The focus is primarily on *training loss* behavior. If comparisons are made on *test accuracy*, it needs to be clearly distinguished from the core claim of *training loss convergence*. The theoretical paper might not be primarily concerned with generalization, but a robust empirical section should at least acknowledge it.\\n*   **Fairness of Comparison:** If other FL methods are included, it's crucial that comparisons are fair (e.g., same model architecture, similar computational budget, same number of communication rounds).\\n\\n### **4. Robustness of Results**\\n\\n*   **Multiple Runs/Random Seeds:**\\n    *   **Potential Weakness:** It's common for ML papers, especially theoretical ones, to show results from a single random seed for illustrative purposes. However, to establish true robustness, results should be averaged over multiple independent runs with different random seeds. This provides confidence intervals or standard deviations, showing the variability of the results. Without this, there's a risk of \\\"cherry-picking\\\" a favorable run.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:**\\n    *   **Strength (if present):** Showing how the linear convergence property changes when varying `C`, `E`, `B`, or the learning rate provides valuable insight into the practical boundaries of the theoretical claim. Does the linearity break down quickly outside a narrow hyperparameter window?\\n    *   **Potential Weakness:** If only one specific set of hyperparameters is shown that yields the \\\"perfect\\\" linear plot, it might not generalize well.\\n*   **Varying Degree of Overparameterization:** Does the theory hold for \\\"just barely\\\" overparameterized models, or only for extremely wide/deep networks? Exploring this empirically is important.\\n*   **Different Non-IID Scenarios:** If non-IID data is used, testing different degrees of non-IIDness (e.g., varying the alpha parameter in Dirichlet distribution) would demonstrate robustness across diverse data heterogeneity levels.\\n\\n### **5. Statistical Significance**\\n\\n*   **Lack of Formal Tests:** Like many empirical ML papers, it's highly probable that formal statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) are *not* performed or explicitly reported. This is a common gap in the field.\\n*   **Visual Evidence:** The primary evidence for linear convergence often comes from log-scale plots of training loss vs. communication rounds, where a straight line indicates linear convergence. While visually compelling, this isn't a formal statistical proof.\\n*   **Implication:** Without statistical tests or confidence intervals from multiple runs, it's harder to rigorously claim that observed differences or trends are statistically significant and not just due to random chance or specific initializations. The \\\"credibility\\\" relies more on the strength of the theoretical argument and the consistency of visual trends.\\n\\n### **6. Overall Credibility and Potential Biases/Limitations**\\n\\n*   **Credibility:** The paper's credibility hinges on whether the empirical results consistently align with the theoretical predictions. If the plots clearly show the promised linear convergence under the specified conditions (especially overparameterization), it adds strong empirical backing.\\n*   **Potential Biases:**\\n    *   **Focus on Training Loss:** The primary bias is the intense focus on *training loss* convergence. While this directly relates to the theoretical claim, in practice, what matters most is *generalization performance* (test accuracy/loss). A model that converges linearly to zero training loss but performs poorly on unseen data (overfitting) is not practically useful. The paper might implicitly assume that zero training loss implies good generalization in the overparameterized regime (a common belief, but not universally true or without caveats).\\n    *   **Idealized FL Setup:** The simulations likely use a simplified FL environment (e.g., no client dropouts, perfect communication, homogeneous compute resources). Real-world FL is far more complex.\\n    *   **\\\"Golden Path\\\" Hyperparameters:** It's easy to find one set of hyperparameters that perfectly illustrate a theoretical claim without exploring the parameter space broadly.\\n*   **Limitations (beyond what's already mentioned):**\\n    *   **Scalability:** The experiments are likely limited to relatively small models and datasets. How does this linear convergence scale to massive models (e.g., large transformers) and larger, more complex real-world datasets?\\n    *   **Computational Efficiency:** While training loss convergence is discussed, the paper might not delve into the computational or communication cost implications of achieving overparameterization or the specific hyperparameter settings needed for linear convergence.\\n    *   **Applicability beyond FedAvg:** The claims are specific to FedAvg. The insights might not directly translate to other more advanced FL algorithms.\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **More Comprehensive Non-IID Analysis:** Conduct experiments across a wider spectrum of non-IID data distributions (e.g., varying Dirichlet $\\\\alpha$, different numbers of classes per client, different data sizes per client). This is paramount for FL research.\\n2.  **Ablation Studies on Overparameterization:** Systematically vary the degree of overparameterization (e.g., model width/depth) and show its explicit impact on the linear convergence rate and whether it breaks the linearity. This would solidify the importance of this factor.\\n3.  **Robustness via Multiple Runs:** Report results averaged over multiple random seeds (e.g., 5-10) with standard deviations or confidence intervals, especially for key metrics and plots.\\n4.  **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Provide more extensive sensitivity analysis for `C`, `E`, `B`, and the learning rate, clearly showing how these parameters influence the linear convergence and its rate.\\n5.  **Generalization Performance Context:** While the focus is training loss, include test accuracy/loss results alongside training loss plots to give a complete picture of the model's utility. Discuss potential overfitting if zero training loss does not translate to good generalization.\\n6.  **Comparison to Other FL Baselines (if appropriate):** If the paper aims for practical relevance, a brief comparison against a few competitive FL algorithms (even if just on test accuracy) would provide valuable context.\\n7.  **Discussion of Practical Implications:** Explicitly discuss the practical implications and limitations of achieving zero training loss linearly, especially regarding the computational cost of overparameterization and the challenges of real-world FL deployment.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, the empirical section of \\\"FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly\\\" likely serves as a good illustration of its theoretical claims, particularly regarding the role of overparameterization in achieving linear convergence of training loss. However, to strengthen its validity, generalizability, and practical relevance, more comprehensive robustness checks, detailed non-IID analysis, and a broader discussion of its practical implications beyond idealized settings would be highly beneficial.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9378302\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please scrutinize the experimental setup, the choice of datasets, the comparison with existing methods, and the robustness of the results presented in the paper, 'FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly: The Power of Overparameterized Multi-Layer Neural Networks'.
