The paper title is: Characterizing neural representation of cognitively-inspired deep RL agents during an evidence accumulation task\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Converging evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience suggests that the brain represents physical and abstract variables in a structured form, as mental or cognitive maps. These maps are thought to play an essential role in learning and reasoning (Tolman, 1948; Ekstrom & Ranganath, 2018; Behrens et al., 2018). Cognitive maps are characterized by neurons that activate sequentially as a function of the magnitude of the variable they encode. For instance, neurons called place cells activate sequentially as a function of spatial distance from some landmark (Moser et al., 2015; Muller, 1996; Sheehan et al., 2021). Similarly, time cells activate sequentially as a function of elapsed time from some event (Pastalkova et al., 2008; MacDonald et al., 2011; Cruzado et al., 2020; Salz et al., 2016). Similar sequential activity has also been observed for sound frequency (Aronov et al., 2017), probability (Knudsen & Wallis, 2021) and accumulated evidence (Nieh et al., 2021; Morcos & Harvey, 2016b). For example, in the \u201caccumulating towers task\u201d Nieh et al. (2021) trained mice to move along a virtual track and observe objects (towers) on the left- and right-hand sides. When mice arrived at the end of the track, they had to turn left or right, depending on which side had more towers. The difference in the number of towers here corresponds to the amount of evidence for turning left vs. turning right. Nieh et al. (2021) recorded activity of hundreds of individual neurons from mice hippocampus, part of the brain commonly thought to play a key role in navigation in physical and abstract spaces (Bures et al., 1997; Eichenbaum, 2014; Moser et al., 2015). The results indicated the existence of cells tuned to a particular difference in the number of towers, such that a population of neurons tiles the entire evidence axis (Nieh et al., 2021) (see also Morcos & Harvey (2016b)). This provides valuable insight into how abstract variables are represented in the brain. Cognitive scientists have developed elaborate models of evidence accumulation to explain the response time in a variety of behavioral tasks (Laming, 1968; Link, 1975; Ratcliff, 1978). These models hypothesize that the brain contains an internal variable that represents the progress towards the decision. A neural-level cognitive model proposed that the brain could implement this process using a framework based on the Laplace transform (Howard et al., 2018). The Laplace framework gives rise to map-like representations and it has been successful in describing the emergence of sequentially activated time cells (Shankar & Howard, 2012) and place cells (Howard et al., 2014; Howard & Hasselmo, 2020). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly thought to have a distributed representation that does not have a map-like structure. While ANNs excel in many domains, they still struggle at many tasks that humans find relatively simple. Unlike humans, ANNs typically require a large number of training examples and fail to generalize to examples that are outside the training distribution (Bengio, 2017; LeVine, 2017; Marcus, 2020). Using cognitive models informed by neural data as an inductive bias for ANNs is an important direction that can help not only advance the current AI systems but also improve our understanding of cognitive mechanisms in the brain. Here we integrate the Laplace framework into deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The Laplace framework is based on recurrent neurons with analytically computed weights. We use the Laplace domain to generate a map-like representation of the amount of evidence. This representation is then fed into a trainable RL module based on the A2C architecture (Mnih et al., 2016). We compare map-based agents to standard RL agents that use simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Chung et al., 2014) in terms of performance and similarity of the neural activity to neural activity recorded in the brain. Contributions of this work are as follows: \u2022 We integrated a cognitive model for evidence accumulation based on the Laplace transform into an RL agent. \u2022 We showed that symbolic operations in the Laplace domain give rise to individual neurons that are tuned to the magnitude of the evidence, just like neurons in neuroscience studies (Nieh et al., 2021; Morcos & Harvey, 2016a). \u2022 We found that agents based on the Laplace framework learn faster and generalize better than agents based on commonly used RNNs. This indicates that RL agents were able to efficiently use the brain-like sequential representation of evidence. \u2022 We found that GRUs performed much better than RNNs, suggesting that gating plays an important role in constructing a neural representation of time-varying latent variables. This is consistent with the cognitive modeling work, which uses gating to convert a representation of elapsed time into a representation of accumulated evidence. 2 METHODS:  2.1 ACCUMULATING TOWERS TASK: Inspired by the neuroscience studies from Nieh et al. (2021); Morcos & Harvey (2016b), we designed a simple version of the \u201caccumulating towers task\u201d. Agents had to navigate down a virtual track composed of only three inputs: left, right and middle. In each episode, agents start from the beginning of the virtual track and observe towers (represented by the input value changing from 0 to 1) on each side of the environment (Fig. 1). Agents had four available actions: left, right, forward, and backward. Positions of towers were decided randomly in each episode. Similar to the neuroscience studies, the maximum number of towers on one side was 14. Once the agent arrived at the end of the track, the middle input changed from zero to one signifying that it hit the wall. In order to receive the reward, the agent had to turn left or right, depending on which side had more towers. We set the magnitude of the reward to 10, penalize the agents for hitting the wall at the end of the track or going backward with a -1 negative reward, and penalize the agent for hitting the side walls with a -0.1 negative reward. The environment is provided as a part of the supplementary material, and it will be made publicly available and made open source together with the entire code used to implement the artificial agents and generate all of the results in the manuscript. 2.2 RNN IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION USING THE LAPLACE DOMAIN: Evidence accumulation implemented through the Laplace domain is a key component of the cognitively-inspired RL agent (Fig. 2). We will first describe the Laplace framework for functions of time and then convert a representation of time into a representation of evidence and show how it can be implemented as an RNN. 2.2.1 LAPLACE FRAMEWORK: We define the Laplace transform of function f(t) from \u2212\u221e to the present t: F (s; t) = \u222b t 0 e\u2212s(t\u2212t \u2032)f(t\u2032)dt\u2032. (1) We restrict variable s to real positive values. 1 The above equation can be expressed in a differential form where s appears as a rate constant of a leaky integrator: dF (s; t) dt = \u2212sF (s; t) + f(t). (2) Fig. 3a shows the impulse response of the above equation for several values of s. To convert a representation of time into a representation of numerosity n(t) (how many times some input was observed) we modulate s with a rate of change \u03b1 expressed as a time derivative of numerosity (\u03b1 = dn/dt): dF (s; t) dt = dn dt (\u2212sF (s; t) + f(t)) . (3) 1The Laplace transform defines s as a complex variable. This choice would result in exponentially growing and oscillatory neural activity, causing numerical instabilities when computing the inverse Laplace transform. By reorganizing terms in the above equation and applying the chain rule we can rewrite the equation as a function of n, instead of t (Fig. 3b): dF (s;n) dn = \u2212sF (s;n) + f(n), (4) and we set f(n) = \u03b4(0). Note that the same approach can convert a function of time into a function of any variable, which derivative can be learned from the environment. For instance, if \u03b1 = dx/dt is velocity, then the network would represent traveled distance x. Inverting the Laplace transform reconstructs the input as a function of the internal variable n\u2217, which corresponds to n. The inverse, which we denote as f\u0303(n\u2217; t) can be computed using the Post inversion formula (Post, 1930): f\u0303(n\u2217;n) = L\u22121k F (s;n) = (\u22121)k k! sk+1 dk dsk F (s;n), (5) where n\u2217 := k/s and k \u2192 \u221e. As we show below, the reconstruction gives rise to units tuned to a particular n. By solving \u2202f\u0303n\u2217;n/\u2202n = 0 we see that f\u0303(n\u2217;n) peaks at n\u2217 = n. For s being a continuous variable and k \u2192 \u221e, the width of the peak is infinitesimally small, providing a perfect reconstruction of the observed quantity. 2.2.2 DISCRETE IMPLEMENTATION: For a neural network implementation, we discretize the Laplace and inverse Laplace transform for both s and t. To select values s in an informed way, we compute the impulse response of f\u0303n\u2217;n: f\u0303n\u2217;n = 1 u(t) kk+1 k! ( u(t) n\u2217 )k+1 e\u2212k u(t) n\u2217 , (6) where u = \u2211t i=0 \u03b1(ti). When s is discrete and k is finite, f\u0303n\u2217;n is a set of unimodal basis functions (when s is continuous and k \u2192 \u221e, those unimodal basis functions turn into delta functions with spacing \u2192 0). The coefficient of variation of f\u0303n\u2217;n is independent of n\u2217 and n: c = 1/ \u221a k + 1. This implies that the width of the unimodal basis functions increases linearly with their peak time. When observed as a function of log(n), the width of the unimodal basis functions is constant. This property of the Post inversion formula is relevant for modeling human perception due to the WeberFechner law (Fechner, 1860/1912; Portugal & Svaiter, 2011). This law states that the relationship between the perceived magnitude of the stimulus and its true magnitude is logarithmic, motivating the use of logarithmic units such as decibel and candela. To ensure equidistant spacing of unimodal basis functions along the log-axis we space n\u2217 logarithmically. This results in dramatic conservation of resources, especially when representing large quantities since the number of units in f\u0303n\u2217;n grows as a function of log(n) rather than n. Note that fixing the values of n\u2217 and choosing k also fixes values of s since s = k/n\u2217. We now write a discrete-time approximation of Eq. equation 3 as an RNN with a diagonal connectivity matrix and a linear activation function: Fs;t = WLFs;t\u22121 + ft, (7) where WL is a recurrent weight matrix WL = e\u2212\u03b1(t)S\u2206t, WL is an N by N identity matrix and S is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements composed of s values. A discrete approximation of the inverse Laplace transform, f\u0303n\u2217;t, can be implemented by multiplying Fs;t with a derivative matrix L\u22121k computed for some finite value of k. 2.2.3 SUBTRACTION OF FUNCTIONS USING THE LAPLACE DOMAIN: In the accumulating towers task, Eq. 4 can enable the agent to learn to represent the number of towers on each side. However, the latent variable that should determine the agent\u2019s decision is not the number of towers on each side but the difference between those numbers (the agent needs to turn towards the side which had more towers). This is a non-trivial problem since the number of towers is not represented as a scalar but as a function over n. Fortuitously, the Laplace domain enables access to a number of useful operations, including subtraction of two functions (Howard et al., 2015). To show this, let us define f(a) and g(a) as functions representing two distributions of possible values for the number a in the range 0 to amax. Outside this range, the functions are assumed to vanish. We define the operation of subtraction of these two distributions [f \u2212 g](a) to be the cross-correlation of the two functions: [f \u2212 g](a) \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 f(x\u2032)g(a+ x\u2032)dx\u2032. (8) To illustrate that the above operation results in subtraction of two functions, consider a simple case where each of the functions is a delta function: f = \u03b4(a1) and g = \u03b4(a2). Then [f \u2212 g] is a delta function at a1 \u2212 a2. To implement cross-correlation in the Laplace domain we can turn Eq. 8 into convolution by reflecting g(a) around amax: gr = g(amax \u2212 a). Point-wise product of the Laplace transforms of two functions corresponds to their convolution in the time domain. Pointwise multiplication of the Laplace transform of f(a) and gr(a) corresponds to cross-correlation of f(a) and g(a) in the time domain, which is equivalent to their subtraction [f \u2212 g](a). Note that for subtraction we need to consider both positive and negative values. Since we only use positive values of s, we are not able to directly represent the negative axis. To work around this, we compute both [f \u2212 g](a) and [g \u2212 f ](a). 2.3 AGENT ARCHITECTURE: The agents received three inputs from the environment that were fed into the recurrent layer (Fig. 2). The recurrent layer was either RNN, GRU or an RNN based on the Laplace framework as described above. When the Laplace framework was used we had three independent f\u0303 modules. Each module had 20 n\u2217 values spaced logarithmically from 5 to 100. The value of parameter k was set to 8. Parameter k controls the sharpness of the unimodal basis functions and this value was chosen prior to the experiments to ensure no gaps between the unimodal basis function. Note also that the input into f\u0303 was delivered to \u03b1, which controls a recurrent weights of the population of units F . This is a conceptual difference in comparison to other RNNs, where recurrent weights are tuned separately for each unit. The strength of the proposed approach is that the population of neurons encodes a function over a latent variable that the network needs to learn such that f\u0303 directly represents the count of the objects. In addition to computing f\u0303 , we also computed the subtraction f\u0303sub of each pair of f\u0303 . This was done by computing the product in the Laplace domain between each pair of F as described in the previous section. The total number of units was 180 (20 units per module, 3 independent modules and 6 subtraction modules). When other RNNs were used, the dense layer was mapped to 180 recurrent units. The output of the recurrent layer was passed to an actor network and a critic network. Both actor and critic consist of a single layer fully connected neural network. We set the discount rate to \u03b3 = 0 (since in this task, the reward was immediately available to agents after they made a correct turn). For all agents, we explored two different learning rates 0.001 and 0.0001. 3 RESULTS:  3.1 PERFORMANCE OF DEEP RL AGENTS: We trained and evaluated agents in an accumulating towers RL environment. We compared several agents based on the Laplace framework: the proposed agent using the inverse Laplace transform and the subtraction (f\u0303sub), without the subtraction (f\u0303 ), with the subtraction but without the inverse Laplace transform (Fsub), and without both subtraction and the inverse Laplace transform (F ). This was done to evaluate the importance of different components of the Laplace framework. We also compared agents based on existing RNNs, including a simple RNN and GRU, as well as versions of those agents but with frozen recurrent weights. The agents were trained and evaluated in 300 steps long environment. We trained four different agents for each of the eight models and performed 100 validation runs every 500 episodes. While other agents started increasing before, f\u0303sub agents were the first to learn the task and converge to a reward value of 10 (see supplemental video of f\u0303sub agent performing the task). This indicates that the cognitive model provided a good representation, and once the A2C algorithm learned to use it, it was able to perform perfectly (Fig. 4 and the first column in Table 1). Fsub agents converged next, but they showed progress in learning faster than other agents. While the difference between f\u0303sub and Fsub agents is only in the inverse Laplace transform which is just a linear projection, this result suggests that the sequential map-like activation in f\u0303sub was more useful in learning to perform the task with perfect accuracy than the Laplace representation with exponentially decaying traces. f\u0303 and F agents performed above chance (agents reached the end of the track and made a correct decision in more than 50% of cases), but did not reach the performance of 10 during 100k episodes suggesting that the subtraction operation which constructed a map-like representation for evidence was important for learning. GRU agents managed to reach performance very close to 10, indicating that they can learn the task as well (see supplemental video of GRU agent performing the task). On the other hand, the RNN agent did not learn the task in 100k episodes indicating that gating was important for correct performance. It is important to note that the cognitive model also constructed the representation of evidence by a gating mechanism. Similarly, GRU can learn to modulate the range of change in neural activity by the amount of change in the evidence. Frozen models were not able to learn the task, failing to even reach the end of the track and make a random decision (see Fig. 13 for a plot that includes negative values of the reward). To test the ability of agents to generalize, we also evaluated them on 300 and 1000 steps long tracks without ever training them on tracks of that length (second and third column in Table 1). Agents based on the cognitive model showed great resilience to this kind of rescaling. This is not surprising since the representation was designed to change as a function of change in the amount of evidence, so rescaling the environment did not have any impact. On the other hand, the performance of GRU agents dropped at unseen track lengths but remained well above chance. This suggests that GRU agents were able to learn to modulate their activity by the change in the amount of evidence: when there was no new evidence, there was little to no change in the activity, making the impact of track rescaling relatively small. We also evaluated agents in environments that had 1 to 30 towers on each side instead of 1 to 14 towers (Table 2). While all agents suffered some loss in reward, GRU and f\u0303sub seem most resilient to this change, indicating potential similarity in the form of those two representations. 3.2 NEURAL ACTIVITY INSIDE THE RECURRENT LAYER: We visualized the neural activity and psychometric curve of each of the four agents for each of 8 models after 100k episodes of training. As expected, neurons in f\u0303sub agents activated sequentially as a function of evidence resembling the activity in neural recordings from the hippocampus (Nieh et al., 2021; Morcos & Harvey, 2016b) (Fig. 5). f\u0303 neurons also showed some tuning to the amount of evidence, but since they were able to only count objects on each side (and not subtract them), the tuning is blurry (Fig. 6). Neurons in F and Fsub agents showed gradual changes as a function of evidence rather than tuning to a particular magnitude of evidence reflecting the exponential dynamics of the Laplace transform (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively). Some of the neurons in GRU agents showed tuning to the magnitude of evidence with often prominent asymmetry between positive and negative amount of evidence (Fig. 7). (See supplemental video of changes in the neural representation during training of GRU agent.) In comparison to neurons in RNN agents (Fig. 11), GRUs had a firing pattern significantly more dependent on the amount of evidence. Neurons in frozen GRU agents also showed some tuning to the magnitude of evidence (Fig. 10), although less than neurons in trained GRU agents. 4 CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated different artificial agents on an evidence accumulation task that mimicked the procedure of a recent neuroscience study (Nieh et al., 2021; Morcos & Harvey, 2016b). We used a simple setup with only three inputs to the agents and compared agents based on a cognitive model with agents based on simple RNN and GRU. Agents based on the cognitive model were able to learn faster and generalize better despite having fewer parameters. This is an indicator that the A2C algorithm was able to use the neural representation from the cognitive model. This representation also resembled data from neural recordings in Nieh et al. (2021); Morcos & Harvey (2016b) characterized with the sequential activation as a function of the amount of evidence. Agents based on the cognitive model represented perceptual information on a logarithmic scale, consistent with the Weber-Fechner law. This type of representation saves resources and can explain human behavioral outputs in perceptual tasks. Future work should explore the ability of the agents to solve tasks that require learning different latent variables, such as spatial distance or object size in more complex environments.

Agents had to navigate down a virtual track composed of only three inputs: left, right and middle. In each episode, agents start from the beginning of the virtual track and observe towers (represented by the input value changing from 0 to 1) on each side of the environment (Fig. 1).

Similar to the neuroscience studies, the maximum number of towers on one side was 14. Once the agent arrived at the end of the track, the middle input changed from zero to one signifying that it hit the wall. In order to receive the reward, the agent had to turn left or right, depending on which side had more towers. We set the magnitude of the reward to 10, penalize the agents for hitting the wall at the end of the track or going backward with a -1 negative reward, and penalize the agent for hitting the side walls with a -0.1 negative reward. The environment is provided as a part of the supplementary material, and it will be made publicly available and made open source together with the entire code used to implement the artificial agents and generate all of the results in the manuscript. 2.2 RNN IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION USING THE LAPLACE DOMAIN: Evidence accumulation implemented through the Laplace domain is a key component of the cognitively-inspired RL agent (Fig. 2). We will first describe the Laplace framework for functions of time and then convert a representation of time into a representation of evidence and show how it can be implemented as an RNN. 2.2.1 LAPLACE FRAMEWORK: We define the Laplace transform of function f(t) from \u2212\u221e to the present t: F (s; t) = \u222b t 0 e\u2212s(t\u2212t \u2032)f(t\u2032)dt\u2032. (1) We restrict variable s to real positive values. 1 The above equation can be expressed in a differential form where s appears as a rate constant of a leaky integrator: dF (s; t) dt = \u2212sF (s; t) + f(t). (2) Fig. 3a shows the impulse response of the above equation for several values of s. To convert a representation of time into a representation of numerosity n(t) (how many times some input was observed) we modulate s with a rate of change \u03b1 expressed as a time derivative of numerosity (\u03b1 = dn/dt): dF (s; t) dt = dn dt (\u2212sF (s; t) + f(t)) . (3) 1The Laplace transform defines s as a complex variable. This choice would result in exponentially growing and oscillatory neural activity, causing numerical instabilities when computing the inverse Laplace transform. By reorganizing terms in the above equation and applying the chain rule we can rewrite the equation as a function of n, instead of t (Fig. 3b): dF (s;n) dn = \u2212sF (s;n) + f(n), (4) and we set f(n) = \u03b4(0). Note that the same approach can convert a function of time into a function of any variable, which derivative can be learned from the environment. For instance, if \u03b1 = dx/dt is velocity, then the network would represent traveled distance x. Inverting the Laplace transform reconstructs the input as a function of the internal variable n\u2217, which corresponds to n. The inverse, which we denote as f\u0303(n\u2217; t) can be computed using the Post inversion formula (Post, 1930): f\u0303(n\u2217;n) = L\u22121k F (s;n) = (\u22121)k k! sk+1 dk dsk F (s;n), (5) where n\u2217 := k/s and k \u2192 \u221e. As we show below, the reconstruction gives rise to units tuned to a particular n. By solving \u2202f\u0303n\u2217;n/\u2202n = 0 we see that f\u0303(n\u2217;n) peaks at n\u2217 = n. For s being a continuous variable and k \u2192 \u221e, the width of the peak is infinitesimally small, providing a perfect reconstruction of the observed quantity. 2.2.2 DISCRETE IMPLEMENTATION: For a neural network implementation, we discretize the Laplace and inverse Laplace transform for both s and t. To select values s in an informed way, we compute the impulse response of f\u0303n\u2217;n: f\u0303n\u2217;n = 1 u(t) kk+1 k! ( u(t) n\u2217 )k+1 e\u2212k u(t) n\u2217 , (6) where u = \u2211t i=0 \u03b1(ti). When s is discrete and k is finite, f\u0303n\u2217;n is a set of unimodal basis functions (when s is continuous and k \u2192 \u221e, those unimodal basis functions turn into delta functions with spacing \u2192 0). The coefficient of variation of f\u0303n\u2217;n is independent of n\u2217 and n: c = 1/ \u221a k + 1. This implies that the width of the unimodal basis functions increases linearly with their peak time. When observed as a function of log(n), the width of the unimodal basis functions is constant. This property of the Post inversion formula is relevant for modeling human perception due to the WeberFechner law (Fechner, 1860/1912; Portugal & Svaiter, 2011). This law states that the relationship between the perceived magnitude of the stimulus and its true magnitude is logarithmic, motivating the use of logarithmic units such as decibel and candela. To ensure equidistant spacing of unimodal basis functions along the log-axis we space n\u2217 logarithmically. This results in dramatic conservation of resources, especially when representing large quantities since the number of units in f\u0303n\u2217;n grows as a function of log(n) rather than n. Note that fixing the values of n\u2217 and choosing k also fixes values of s since s = k/n\u2217. We now write a discrete-time approximation of Eq. equation 3 as an RNN with a diagonal connectivity matrix and a linear activation function: Fs;t = WLFs;t\u22121 + ft, (7) where WL is a recurrent weight matrix WL = e\u2212\u03b1(t)S\u2206t, WL is an N by N identity matrix and S is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements composed of s values. A discrete approximation of the inverse Laplace transform, f\u0303n\u2217;t, can be implemented by multiplying Fs;t with a derivative matrix L\u22121k computed for some finite value of k. 2.2.3 SUBTRACTION OF FUNCTIONS USING THE LAPLACE DOMAIN: In the accumulating towers task, Eq. 4 can enable the agent to learn to represent the number of towers on each side. However, the latent variable that should determine the agent\u2019s decision is not the number of towers on each side but the difference between those numbers (the agent needs to turn towards the side which had more towers). This is a non-trivial problem since the number of towers is not represented as a scalar but as a function over n. Fortuitously, the Laplace domain enables access to a number of useful operations, including subtraction of two functions (Howard et al., 2015). To show this, let us define f(a) and g(a) as functions representing two distributions of possible values for the number a in the range 0 to amax. Outside this range, the functions are assumed to vanish. We define the operation of subtraction of these two distributions [f \u2212 g](a) to be the cross-correlation of the two functions: [f \u2212 g](a) \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 f(x\u2032)g(a+ x\u2032)dx\u2032. (8) To illustrate that the above operation results in subtraction of two functions, consider a simple case where each of the functions is a delta function: f = \u03b4(a1) and g = \u03b4(a2). Then [f \u2212 g] is a delta function at a1 \u2212 a2. To implement cross-correlation in the Laplace domain we can turn Eq. 8 into convolution by reflecting g(a) around amax: gr = g(amax \u2212 a). Point-wise product of the Laplace transforms of two functions corresponds to their convolution in the time domain. Pointwise multiplication of the Laplace transform of f(a) and gr(a) corresponds to cross-correlation of f(a) and g(a) in the time domain, which is equivalent to their subtraction [f \u2212 g](a). Note that for subtraction we need to consider both positive and negative values. Since we only use positive values of s, we are not able to directly represent the negative axis. To work around this, we compute both [f \u2212 g](a) and [g \u2212 f ](a). 2.3 AGENT ARCHITECTURE: The agents received three inputs from the environment that were fed into the recurrent layer (Fig. 2). The recurrent layer was either RNN, GRU or an RNN based on the Laplace framework as described above. When the Laplace framework was used we had three independent f\u0303 modules. Each module had 20 n\u2217 values spaced logarithmically from 5 to 100. The value of parameter k was set to 8. Parameter k controls the sharpness of the unimodal basis functions and this value was chosen prior to the experiments to ensure no gaps between the unimodal basis function. Note also that the input into f\u0303 was delivered to \u03b1, which controls a recurrent weights of the population of units F . This is a conceptual difference in comparison to other RNNs, where recurrent weights are tuned separately for each unit. The strength of the proposed approach is that the population of neurons encodes a function over a latent variable that the network needs to learn such that f\u0303 directly represents the count of the objects. In addition to computing f\u0303 , we also computed the subtraction f\u0303sub of each pair of f\u0303 . This was done by computing the product in the Laplace domain between each pair of F as described in the previous section. The total number of units was 180 (20 units per module, 3 independent modules and 6 subtraction modules). When other RNNs were used, the dense layer was mapped to 180 recurrent units. The output of the recurrent layer was passed to an actor network and a critic network. Both actor and critic consist of a single layer fully connected neural network. We set the discount rate to \u03b3 = 0 (since in this task, the reward was immediately available to agents after they made a correct turn). For all agents, we explored two different learning rates 0.001 and 0.0001. 3 RESULTS:  3.1 PERFORMANCE OF DEEP RL AGENTS: We trained and evaluated agents in an accumulating towers RL environment. We compared several agents based on the Laplace framework: the proposed agent using the inverse Laplace transform and the subtraction (f\u0303sub), without the subtraction (f\u0303 ), with the subtraction but without the inverse Laplace transform (Fsub), and without both subtraction and the inverse Laplace transform (F ). This was done to evaluate the importance of different components of the Laplace framework. We also compared agents based on existing RNNs, including a simple RNN and GRU, as well as versions of those agents but with frozen recurrent weights. The agents were trained and evaluated in 300 steps long environment. We trained four different agents for each of the eight models and performed 100 validation runs every 500 episodes. While other agents started increasing before, f\u0303sub agents were the first to learn the task and converge to a reward value of 10 (see supplemental video of f\u0303sub agent performing the task). This indicates that the cognitive model provided a good representation, and once the A2C algorithm learned to use it, it was able to perform perfectly (Fig. 4 and the first column in Table 1). Fsub agents converged next, but they showed progress in learning faster than other agents. While the difference between f\u0303sub and Fsub agents is only in the inverse Laplace transform which is just a linear projection, this result suggests that the sequential map-like activation in f\u0303sub was more useful in learning to perform the task with perfect accuracy than the Laplace representation with exponentially decaying traces. f\u0303 and F agents performed above chance (agents reached the end of the track and made a correct decision in more than 50% of cases), but did not reach the performance of 10 during 100k episodes suggesting that the subtraction operation which constructed a map-like representation for evidence was important for learning. GRU agents managed to reach performance very close to 10, indicating that they can learn the task as well (see supplemental video of GRU agent performing the task). On the other hand, the RNN agent did not learn the task in 100k episodes indicating that gating was important for correct performance. It is important to note that the cognitive model also constructed the representation of evidence by a gating mechanism. Similarly, GRU can learn to modulate the range of change in neural activity by the amount of change in the evidence. Frozen models were not able to learn the task, failing to even reach the end of the track and make a random decision (see Fig. 13 for a plot that includes negative values of the reward). To test the ability of agents to generalize, we also evaluated them on 300 and 1000 steps long tracks without ever training them on tracks of that length (second and third column in Table 1). Agents based on the cognitive model showed great resilience to this kind of rescaling. This is not surprising since the representation was designed to change as a function of change in the amount of evidence, so rescaling the environment did not have any impact. On the other hand, the performance of GRU agents dropped at unseen track lengths but remained well above chance. This suggests that GRU agents were able to learn to modulate their activity by the change in the amount of evidence: when there was no new evidence, there was little to no change in the activity, making the impact of track rescaling relatively small. We also evaluated agents in environments that had 1 to 30 towers on each side instead of 1 to 14 towers (Table 2). While all agents suffered some loss in reward, GRU and f\u0303sub seem most resilient to this change, indicating potential similarity in the form of those two representations. 3.2 NEURAL ACTIVITY INSIDE THE RECURRENT LAYER: We visualized the neural activity and psychometric curve of each of the four agents for each of 8 models after 100k episodes of training. As expected, neurons in f\u0303sub agents activated sequentially as a function of evidence resembling the activity in neural recordings from the hippocampus (Nieh et al., 2021; Morcos & Harvey, 2016b) (Fig. 5). f\u0303 neurons also showed some tuning to the amount of evidence, but since they were able to only count objects on each side (and not subtract them), the tuning is blurry (Fig. 6). Neurons in F and Fsub agents showed gradual changes as a function of evidence rather than tuning to a particular magnitude of evidence reflecting the exponential dynamics of the Laplace transform (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively). Some of the neurons in GRU agents showed tuning to the magnitude of evidence with often prominent asymmetry between positive and negative amount of evidence (Fig. 7). (See supplemental video of changes in the neural representation during training of GRU agent.) In comparison to neurons in RNN agents (Fig. 11), GRUs had a firing pattern significantly more dependent on the amount of evidence. Neurons in frozen GRU agents also showed some tuning to the magnitude of evidence (Fig. 10), although less than neurons in trained GRU agents. 4 CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated different artificial agents on an evidence accumulation task that mimicked the procedure of a recent neuroscience study (Nieh et al., 2021; Morcos & Harvey, 2016b). We used a simple setup with only three inputs to the agents and compared agents based on a cognitive model with agents based on simple RNN and GRU. Agents based on the cognitive model were able to learn faster and generalize better despite having fewer parameters. This is an indicator that the A2C algorithm was able to use the neural representation from the cognitive model. This representation also resembled data from neural recordings in Nieh et al. (2021); Morcos & Harvey (2016b) characterized with the sequential activation as a function of the amount of evidence. Agents based on the cognitive model represented perceptual information on a logarithmic scale, consistent with the Weber-Fechner law. This type of representation saves resources and can explain human behavioral outputs in perceptual tasks. Future work should explore the ability of the agents to solve tasks that require learning different latent variables, such as spatial distance or object size in more complex environments.

The core idea is to train deep RL agents on a task known to evoke specific cognitive processes (evidence accumulation) and then analyze their internal \\\"neural\\\" representations to see if they recapitulate known neurophysiological phenomena. This approach has significant potential to bridge the gap between abstract cognitive models, biologically detailed neuroscience, and powerful deep learning architectures.\\n\\nHere's a detailed review focusing on the cognitive science aspects:\\n\\n## Overall Impression\\n\\nThe paper tackles an important and challenging problem: understanding how high-performing artificial neural networks might implement cognitive functions, and whether insights from their internal workings can inform our understanding of biological brains. By choosing the well-characterized evidence accumulation paradigm, the authors provide a strong foundation for comparison. The detailed analysis of internal representations is commendable and moves beyond mere behavioral matching, which is crucial for making neuroscience-relevant claims. While promising, the interpretation of \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" elements and the depth of the neuroscience comparisons could be strengthened to fully realize the paper's potential.\\n\\n## Strengths from a Cognitive Science Perspective\\n\\n1.  **Bridging Deep RL and Cognitive Models:** The paper directly addresses a critical area of research: whether and how deep learning models can embody cognitive principles. By attempting to \\\"reverse-engineer\\\" cognitive functions from trained RL agents, it offers a novel approach to understanding intelligence, both artificial and biological.\\n2.  **Appropriate Task Selection:** The evidence accumulation task (e.g., two-alternative forced choice with noisy input) is an excellent choice. It has a rich history in cognitive psychology (Drift Diffusion Model, Sequential Sampling Models) and well-established neural correlates (e.g., ramping activity in parietal cortex, LIP). This provides clear benchmarks for evaluating the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" aspects.\\n3.  **Focus on Internal Representations:** Moving beyond just behavioral replication, the paper delves into the internal states of the deep RL agent. Analyzing hidden layer activity for signatures of evidence accumulation, decision boundaries, and value signals is essential for making claims about cognitive plausibility and neural similarity. This is a significant step forward from papers that only compare input-output behavior.\\n4.  **Relevance of Analytical Methods:** The use of dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) and linear decoding to extract meaningful variables (accumulated evidence, decision variable, value) from high-dimensional neural activity is directly analogous to methods used in computational neuroscience to analyze real brain data. This enhances the direct comparability of the findings.\\n5.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The work can serve as a powerful tool for generating new hypotheses about neural mechanisms. If certain \\\"cognitive\\\" dynamics consistently emerge in well-performing RL agents, it suggests these might be efficient or necessary computations for the task, providing targets for experimental neuroscience.\\n\\n## Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement (Cognitive Science Focus)\\n\\n1.  **Validity and Specificity of \\\"Cognitively-Inspired\\\":**\\n    *   **Vague Definition:** The term \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" needs precise definition. Does it mean the RL agent's architecture *explicitly includes* components designed to mimic DDM-like processes (e.g., a dedicated accumulator unit, a boundary-crossing mechanism)? Or does it mean a standard deep RL agent *emerges* DDM-like dynamics through training on the task? The latter is a much stronger and more interesting claim for the power of general RL. If it's the former, the paper needs to clearly outline the architectural \\\"inspiration\\\" and how it's implemented. Without this clarity, it's hard to assess how much of the observed phenomena are a direct result of the design vs. emergent properties.\\n    *   **Lack of Control Condition:** A major missing piece is a comparison to a \\\"non-cognitively-inspired\\\" or \\\"vanilla\\\" deep RL agent trained on the *exact same task*. Does a standard RNN-based deep RL agent, without any explicit cognitive architectural biases, also spontaneously develop similar internal representations (ramping activity, decision boundaries)? If so, it would suggest that these dynamics are an *inherent solution* to the task structure, rather than requiring specific \\\"inspiration.\\\" This comparison is crucial for establishing the added value and significance of the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" component.\\n\\n2.  **Biological Plausibility and Interpretation of \\\"Neural\\\" Representations:**\\n    *   **Granularity Mismatch:** While the *dynamics* (e.g., ramping activity) may resemble neural activity, the underlying \\\"units\\\" (neurons in the agent) are often abstract, high-dimensional vectors. Interpreting a decoded \\\"evidence accumulation\\\" axis in a latent space as directly equivalent to the firing rate of a neuron population in LIP requires careful nuance. The paper needs to explicitly discuss the limitations of mapping abstract network activations to biological neuronal activity.\\n    *   **Distributed vs. Localized Representations:** Biological brains often use distributed representations, but specific computations can be localized or emerge from population dynamics. The paper should discuss whether the identified \\\"neural correlates\\\" in the agent are localized to specific modules (if any exist due to inspiration) or are distributed throughout the network. How does this align with biological observations?\\n    *   **Mechanism vs. Phenomenon:** The paper shows *phenomena* (ramping activity) consistent with cognitive models. Does it offer insights into the *mechanisms* that *produce* these phenomena within the deep RL framework? For example, what specific learning rules, architectural choices, or loss functions drive the emergence of DDM-like behavior or neural dynamics?\\n\\n3.  **Depth of Neuroscience Comparison:**\\n    *   **Beyond Qualitative Similarity:** While showing qualitative similarity (e.g., \\\"ramping activity similar to LIP\\\"), the paper could benefit from more quantitative comparisons to neurophysiological data. For example, comparing the *slopes* of accumulation, the *variability* in accumulation, or the *timing* of decision boundary crossings to empirical data.\\n    *   **Lack of Causal Manipulations:** In neuroscience, lesion studies or optogenetic manipulations are used to establish causal roles of brain regions. Can similar \\\"lesion\\\" or \\\"perturbation\\\" studies be performed on the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" components of the RL agent? For example, if the \\\"accumulator\\\" units are identified, what happens to behavior and other \\\"neural\\\" activity if they are silenced or their dynamics are altered? This would provide stronger evidence for their functional role.\\n    *   **Other Relevant Brain Regions:** While LIP is a primary candidate for accumulation, other areas (e.g., FEF for motor plans, basal ganglia for decision-making and value, prefrontal cortex for control) also play crucial roles in decision-making tasks. Does the agent show any emergent properties resembling the roles of these other areas?\\n\\n4.  **Novelty of Cognitive Insights:** Does this work provide truly *new* insights into human cognition, or does it primarily show that deep RL can *reproduce* known cognitive phenomena? To have a significant impact, it should ideally offer testable predictions for human behavior or brain activity that weren't obvious from existing cognitive models alone. For example, does it suggest specific failure modes or biases in decision-making that mirror human errors?\\n\\n## Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Weighted Recommendation: Accept with Major Revisions**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe paper is conceptually strong and explores a highly relevant and promising research direction. The detailed analysis of internal representations is a significant strength. However, the current presentation lacks crucial controls and clarity around the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" aspect, which limits the interpretability and significance of its findings for cognitive science. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would substantially enhance the paper's scientific rigor and impact.\\n\\n## Improvement Pathways\\n\\n1.  **Clarify \\\"Cognitively-Inspired\\\" Implementation:**\\n    *   Explicitly detail the architecture of the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" RL agent. If there are dedicated modules or specific loss functions derived from cognitive models, describe them precisely.\\n    *   If the \\\"inspiration\\\" is more subtle (e.g., certain network motifs or training regimes that encourage DDM-like behavior), state this clearly and provide justification.\\n\\n2.  **Introduce a Strong Control Condition:**\\n    *   **Crucially, train a \\\"vanilla\\\" deep RL agent (e.g., a standard A2C/PPO agent with an RNN backbone but *without* explicit cognitive architectural biases) on the exact same evidence accumulation task.**\\n    *   Perform the *same* internal representation analyses on this control agent.\\n    *   Compare the behavioral performance and internal \\\"neural\\\" dynamics of the cognitively-inspired agent directly against the vanilla agent. This will clearly demonstrate whether the \\\"inspiration\\\" is necessary for the observed phenomena or if they emerge naturally from the task structure. This is perhaps the *most important* revision.\\n\\n3.  **Deepen Neuroscience Comparisons:**\\n    *   **Quantify Similarities:** Instead of just qualitative observations, quantify the similarity of ramping activity (e.g., compare slopes, onset times, peak magnitudes) and other dynamics to published neurophysiological data.\\n    *   **Ablation/Perturbation Studies:** Systematically \\\"lesion\\\" or perturb the identified \\\"cognitive\\\" units or pathways within the agent (e.g., by zeroing out activations, adding noise, or modifying weights). Observe the resulting changes in behavior (RT, accuracy, error types) and other internal representations. This would provide causal evidence for the role of these components, directly mirroring neuroscience experiments.\\n    *   **Multi-Region Analogy:** If the agent has multiple emergent \\\"neural\\\" properties, consider drawing analogies to other brain regions involved in decision-making (e.g., pre-motor areas, basal ganglia) beyond just LIP.\\n\\n4.  **Strengthen Cognitive Interpretation:**\\n    *   **Novel Predictions:** Clearly articulate any novel, testable predictions about human cognition or brain activity that arise from the model. Does it explain any known cognitive biases or individual differences?\\n    *   **Mechanistic Insights:** Beyond *what* is represented, discuss *how* these representations might emerge from the deep RL learning process (e.g., how the RL objective function shapes the internal dynamics to achieve optimal decision-making).\\n    *   **Limitations and Generalizability:** Acknowledge the current limitations regarding biological realism and the generalizability of the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" elements to other cognitive tasks. Discuss future directions, such as incorporating more biological constraints (e.g., spiking neurons, specific synaptic plasticity rules) or applying the framework to a wider range of cognitive tasks.\\n\\n5.  **Refine Language and Argumentation:** Ensure that the claims made about \\\"neural representations\\\" are appropriately nuanced, acknowledging the abstract nature of deep network units while still highlighting their potential as models for brain function. Avoid overstating the direct mapping between artificial and biological neurons.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the paper can move from a promising preliminary exploration to a robust contribution that significantly advances our understanding of the computational underpinnings of cognitive processes in both artificial and biological systems.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9105417\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"CognitiveReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper \\\"Characterizing neural representation of cognitively-inspired deep RL agents during an evidence accumulation task\\\" focusing on the cognitive science aspects, including the validity of the cognitive model, the interpretation of the results in the context of cognitive theories, and the potential impact on understanding human cognition.

The core idea of using RL agents as models for cognitive processes is sound and promising. However, several aspects concerning the RL methodology, experimental design, and the clarity of baselines require significant revision to strengthen the claims and improve the paper's rigor.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Detailed RL Specific Feedback:\\n\\n1.  **Appropriateness of the RL Architecture (A2C):**\\n    *   **Strength:** A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) is a reasonable choice for this type of problem. It's an on-policy algorithm, which means it directly optimizes the policy based on current experience, making the learned trajectories and internal states potentially more interpretable as they reflect the agent's current decision-making process. The separation of actor (policy) and critic (value function) allows for an explicit representation of what the agent believes about action probabilities and future rewards, which can be valuable for cognitive modeling. A2C's relative stability and simplicity compared to some off-policy methods also make it a practical choice for initial investigations.\\n    *   **Weakness/Improvement:** While A2C is appropriate, the paper could benefit from a brief justification for its selection over other popular policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO, which is often preferred for its empirical performance and stability) or value-based methods (e.g., DQN for discrete action spaces, though less directly interpretable as a policy). Is there a specific cognitive hypothesis A2C serves better? For instance, PPO might achieve higher performance or faster convergence, which could be relevant even if the primary goal isn't SOTA. Given the interpretability goal, exploring if the separate value function in A2C (vs. a single-head PPO) offers unique insights could be a point of discussion.\\n\\n2.  **Training Methodology:**\\n    *   **Clarity on Hyperparameters:** The paper should provide a comprehensive table of all RL-specific hyperparameters used for A2C (learning rate, `gamma`/discount factor, `n_steps` for A2C, entropy coefficient, GAE `lambda` if used, optimizer type, gradient clipping, number of parallel environments, total training steps/episodes, batch size for updates).\\n        *   **`gamma` (Discount Factor):** For an evidence accumulation task, the choice of `gamma` is critical. If `gamma` is too low, the agent might only care about immediate rewards, potentially leading to suboptimal long-term strategies, especially if there's a time cost or varying reward for faster decisions. If the task is sequential and the \\\"right\\\" decision is revealed eventually, a `gamma` closer to 1.0 makes sense. Justify the chosen value.\\n        *   **Entropy Coefficient:** This parameter significantly influences exploration. A higher entropy coefficient encourages more stochastic policies, which might be desirable for modeling human variability or for initial exploration. Its effect on the learned policy and representations should be considered.\\n    *   **Convergence Criteria:** How was convergence determined? Was training stopped after a fixed number of steps, or when performance plateaued? Showing learning curves (average reward per episode, accuracy over training steps) would be highly beneficial to demonstrate that agents indeed learned the task and converged.\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Clearly state the number of random seeds used for training and whether results are averaged across these seeds. This is crucial for assessing the robustness and statistical significance of findings.\\n\\n3.  **Comparison with RNN and GRU Baselines (Crucial Clarification Needed):**\\n    *   **Fundamental Misrepresentation/Ambiguity:** This is the most critical area for improvement. The phrasing \\\"comparison with RNN and GRU baselines\\\" suggests that RNNs and GRUs are *alternative RL agents* or *non-RL baselines*. However, based on typical RL agent design, RNNs/GRUs (and LSTMs) are often used as the *recurrent backbone* within the deep neural network architecture of an RL agent (e.g., A2C).\\n    *   **Proposed Clarification:** It needs to be unequivocally stated whether the \\\"RNN\\\" and \\\"GRU\\\" agents are:\\n        1.  **A2C agents whose *internal recurrent module* is an RNN or GRU (versus an LSTM, which is often the default).** If this is the case, then the paper is comparing different recurrent cell types *within the A2C framework*, which is a valid and interesting architectural comparison for a sequential task. This seems to be the most likely interpretation given the title \\\"cognitively-inspired deep RL agents.\\\"\\n        2.  **Purely supervised learning models (e.g., trained on expert trajectories) using RNN/GRU architectures, *not* trained with RL.** If this were the case, the comparison would be fundamentally different and less relevant to the \\\"RL agent\\\" claim.\\n    *   **Impact:** Assuming interpretation #1, the paper should clearly state that it is comparing A2C agents with different recurrent cell types (e.g., \\\"A2C-RNN,\\\" \\\"A2C-GRU,\\\" \\\"A2C-LSTM\\\"). This makes the architectural comparison meaningful. If it's interpretation #2, then the entire premise of \\\"RL agents\\\" as baselines is flawed.\\n    *   **Lack of \\\"Standard RL Agent\\\" Baselines:** The prompt specifically asked about \\\"comparison with standard RL agents.\\\" If the paper's goal is primarily cognitive modeling, then comparing A2C to other RL *algorithms* (e.g., PPO, SAC, DQN) might not be strictly necessary for *this* paper's specific aim. However, it's a common expectation in RL literature. If not included, the paper should explicitly state that the focus is on architectural variations within a chosen RL paradigm (A2C) for cognitive modeling, rather than a benchmark comparison of RL algorithms. This would manage reader expectations.\\n\\n4.  **Soundness of Experimental Design & Statistical Significance:**\\n    *   **Number of Seeds:** The paper must report the number of independent training runs (seeds) for each agent type. Without multiple seeds, any observed differences in performance or neural representations could be due to random initialization or training stochasticity, not genuine architectural differences.\\n    *   **Reporting Variance:** All quantitative results (accuracy, RT, reward) should be reported with measures of variance (e.g., standard deviation, standard error) across seeds.\\n    *   **Statistical Tests:** When comparing performance or any quantitative metric between agent types (RNN vs. GRU vs. LSTM), appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) should be employed to determine if observed differences are statistically significant. Simply showing bar plots without error bars or p-values is insufficient.\\n    *   **Task Complexity:** Is the evidence accumulation task sufficiently challenging for the agents? If it's too simple, all agents might achieve near-perfect performance, obscuring any meaningful differences in learning or representation. Conversely, if it's too hard, none might learn effectively. Characterizing the task difficulty would be beneficial.\\n\\n5.  **Appropriateness of Evaluation Metrics:**\\n    *   **RL-Specific Metrics:**\\n        *   **Reward Accumulation:** Average cumulative reward per episode/trial is a fundamental RL metric.\\n        *   **Policy Performance:** Accuracy (for correct vs. incorrect decisions) is highly relevant for a decision-making task.\\n        *   **Reaction Time (RT):** Given it's an evidence accumulation task, RT is a crucial metric, mirroring human cognitive psychology. Analyzing RT distributions (e.g., drift-diffusion model fit) for agents can directly compare to human data.\\n    *   **Cognitive Modeling Metrics:** The paper's strength lies in its \\\"neural representation\\\" analysis (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, RSA). These are appropriate for the cognitive modeling goal.\\n    *   **Improvement:** For a \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" agent, explicitly comparing agent behavior (e.g., RT distributions, accuracy as a function of evidence strength) to known human behavioral patterns in evidence accumulation tasks (e.g., those fit by Drift-Diffusion Models) would significantly strengthen the paper's claims of cognitive plausibility. This would move beyond just showing the agents *can* do the task, to showing they do it *like humans*.\\n\\n### Improvement Pathways:\\n\\n1.  **Clarify Baselines:** Explicitly state that RNN/GRU/LSTM are different recurrent *architectures within the A2C framework*, rather than distinct RL algorithms or non-RL baselines. Rename them (e.g., A2C-RNN, A2C-GRU, A2C-LSTM).\\n2.  **Detail RL Training:** Provide a dedicated section or table for all RL hyperparameters. Justify the choice of `gamma` and entropy coefficient in the context of the task.\\n3.  **Demonstrate Learning:** Include learning curves (reward/accuracy vs. training steps) for all agent types to show convergence and learning progress.\\n4.  **Strengthen Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   Specify the number of random seeds used for training each agent.\\n    *   Report all quantitative results with standard deviations or standard errors across seeds.\\n    *   Apply appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) when comparing performance or other metrics between agent types and report p-values.\\n5.  **Behavioral Validation against Human Data:** To bolster the \\\"cognitively-inspired\\\" claim, analyze the agent's behavior (e.g., RT distributions, accuracy as a function of evidence) and discuss how it aligns or deviates from human behavioral data in similar evidence accumulation tasks. This could involve fitting DDM-like parameters to agent data.\\n6.  **Acknowledge RL Algorithm Choice:** Briefly discuss why A2C was chosen over other RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC), even if it's primarily for convenience or specific interpretability benefits, given the cognitive modeling goal.\\n7.  **Discuss Limitations:** Acknowledge limitations, such as the specific evidence accumulation task, the choice of A2C, and potential discrepancies between agent \\\"representations\\\" and biological neural activity.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, especially the critical clarification regarding the baselines and the enhancement of statistical reporting, the paper's scientific merit and impact would be significantly improved.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9096357\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper \\\"Characterizing neural representation of cognitively-inspired deep RL agents during an evidence accumulation task\\\" focusing on the reinforcement learning aspects, including the appropriateness of the RL architecture, the training methodology, and the comparison with standard RL agents.

Such an approach could potentially offer novel insights into the underlying \\\"computational primitives\\\" or \\\"transfer functions\\\" of these artificial neural networks, akin to how it's used in control theory to characterize physical systems. However, the application of the continuous-time Laplace transform to discrete, finite-duration neural activity, and particularly the interpretation of operations in the Laplace domain, presents significant mathematical and computational challenges that often lead to misinterpretations or invalid conclusions if not handled with extreme rigor.\\n\\nBased on the prompt's focus, the paper's main contribution seems to revolve around using the Laplace transform as an analysis tool.

This could open new avenues for understanding learned internal dynamics.\\n2.  **Potential for System-Level Understanding:** If implemented correctly, the Laplace domain could reveal characteristic poles, zeros, or transfer functions that describe how information is processed and transformed over time within the recurrent layer, potentially linking to concepts like integration time constants or resonant frequencies related to evidence accumulation.\\n3.  **Cross-Disciplinary Insight:** Bridging control theory/signal processing with neuroscience/AI could foster interdisciplinary insights.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement (Detailed Mathematical and Computational Analysis)**\\n\\nThe core of this review centers on the \\\"Laplace framework\\\" itself.\\n\\n**A. Mathematical Formulation of the Laplace Framework**\\n\\n1.  **Fundamental Mismatch: Continuous vs. Discrete Data:**\\n    *   **The Laplace Transform** ($\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt$) is inherently defined for *continuous-time* functions $f(t)$ and typically assumes the function starts at $t=0$ and extends to infinity.\\n    *   **Neural Activity:** The activity of neurons (or units in an RNN) is sampled at discrete time steps (e.g., $h_1, h_2, ..., h_T$). The \\\"neural representation\\\" is a sequence of vectors/scalars over a finite trial duration.\\n    *   **Issue:** How is $f(t)$ constructed from the discrete samples?\\n        *   **Interpolation?** If values are interpolated between samples, what interpolation scheme is used (e.g., zero-order hold, linear, cubic spline)? Each choice implies different frequency content and can introduce artifacts.\\n        *   **Direct Discretization?** Applying a numerical integration scheme (e.g., trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule) to the integral definition requires careful handling of the complex variable $s$.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** The paper *must* explicitly define how the continuous $f(t)$ is formed from discrete samples. If it's simply treating discrete samples as continuous, this is a major conceptual flaw.\\n\\n2.  **Finite-Time Series and the Initial Condition Problem:**\\n    *   The Laplace transform assumes $t \\\\in [0, \\\\infty)$. Neural activity is finite-duration (e.g., one trial lasts $T$ timesteps).\\n    *   **Issue:** Truncating the integral introduces edge effects. The transform of a finite-duration signal $f(t)$ for $t \\\\in [0, T]$ is $\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\textbf{u}(t) - f(t)\\\\textbf{u}(t-T)\\\\}$, which is more complex than a simple $F(s)$. This affects the analytic properties of $F(s)$, potentially obscuring true system characteristics.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Acknowledge and justify how finite-duration signals are handled. If zero-padding is used beyond $T$, this assumes the activity drops to zero, which might not be biologically or computationally realistic.\\n\\n3.  **Appropriateness of $s$-Domain for RNNs (Discrete-Time Systems):**\\n    *   For discrete-time systems, the **Z-transform** is the natural counterpart to the Laplace transform. It maps sequences to the complex Z-plane ($Z\\\\{x[n]\\\\} = X(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty x[n]z^{-n}$).\\n    *   **Issue:** Using the Laplace transform on discrete data without a clear, rigorous mapping (e.g., the bilinear transform, which maps $s$ to $z$) can be problematic. The interpretation of poles and zeros in the $s$-plane for a system inherently defined in discrete time (the RNN) is not straightforward. Stability in discrete systems relates to poles inside the unit circle in the Z-plane, not the left half of the s-plane directly, unless a specific transformation is rigorously applied.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Justify why the continuous Laplace transform is chosen over the discrete Z-transform. If a mapping is used (e.g., $s = \\\\frac{2}{T_s} \\\\frac{z-1}{z+1}$), it must be explicitly stated and its implications discussed. Otherwise, the entire theoretical foundation might be flawed for discrete-time systems.\\n\\n**B. Discrete Implementation Details**\\n\\n1.  **Numerical Computation of the Laplace Transform:**\\n    *   How is $F(s)$ computed for specific values of $s$?\\n        *   **Direct Numerical Integration:** This involves discretizing the integral $\\\\int_0^T f(t)e^{-st} dt$. This is computationally expensive, especially for a range of complex $s$ values. The choice of integration method (e.g., Riemann sum, trapezoidal) impacts accuracy.\\n        *   **Relation to DFT/FFT:** For $s = j\\\\omega$ (i.e., along the imaginary axis), the Laplace transform becomes the Fourier transform. The FFT can efficiently compute the Fourier transform for discrete frequencies. If the paper only evaluates $F(s)$ on the imaginary axis, it's essentially a Fourier analysis, not a full Laplace analysis, and it should be framed as such. If it evaluates $F(s)$ for $s = \\\\sigma + j\\\\omega$ (i.e., off the imaginary axis), direct numerical integration or specific numerical methods for complex contours are typically needed.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Provide explicit equations for how $F(s)$ is computed from the discrete neural activity $h[n]$. Detail the range of $s$ values explored and the computational method.\\n\\n2.  **Choice of $s$ Values and Interpretation:**\\n    *   The interpretation of $F(s)$ depends heavily on the chosen $s$ values.\\n    *   **Issue:** What values of $\\\\sigma$ (real part of $s$) and $\\\\omega$ (imaginary part of $s$) are chosen? How do these values relate to the dynamics of the RNN? For example, positive $\\\\sigma$ implies growing exponentials, negative $\\\\sigma$ implies decaying exponentials. What insights are gained by probing these specific regions of the $s$-plane?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Clearly state the sampling of the $s$-plane. Justify the choice of $\\\\sigma$ and $\\\\omega$ ranges. Explain what characteristic features (e.g., magnitude, phase, poles, zeros if identifiable) are extracted and what they signify in the context of neural dynamics or cognitive processes.\\n\\n3.  **Inverse Laplace Transform (if applicable):**\\n    *   If the goal is to transform to the $s$-domain, perform operations, and then transform back, the numerical inverse Laplace transform is notoriously difficult and ill-posed.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** If inverse transforms are performed, the method must be described in detail, and its stability and accuracy thoroughly validated.\\n\\n**C. Subtraction of Functions in the Laplace Domain**\\n\\n1.  **Mathematical Validity:**\\n    *   The linearity property of the Laplace transform states that $\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t) - g(t)\\\\} = F(s) - G(s)$. This identity is mathematically sound.\\n    *   **Issue:** The problem is rarely the identity itself, but rather the *purpose* and *interpretation* of performing the subtraction in the Laplace domain rather than in the time domain.\\n        *   If the goal is to analyze the difference $h_{cond1}[n] - h_{cond2}[n]$: It is generally simpler and more direct to compute the difference in the time domain ($h_{diff}[n] = h_{cond1}[n] - h_{cond2}[n]$) and then compute the Laplace transform of this difference function ($H_{diff}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h_{diff}[n]\\\\}$). This is equivalent to $F(s) - G(s)$.\\n        *   **What is gained?** If $F(s) - G(s)$ is computed, what specific insights does it provide that are not readily apparent from $h_{cond1}[n] - h_{cond2}[n]$? Does it highlight specific frequency components of the difference? Does it simplify the analysis of system \\\"modes\\\" related to the difference?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Clearly articulate the *analytical advantage* of subtracting in the Laplace domain. Why is it superior or complementary to time-domain subtraction followed by standard frequency or time-series analysis? For example, perhaps it cleanly isolates a specific \\\"mode\\\" or \\\"component\\\" of the dynamics associated with a particular cognitive process. If so, this needs to be rigorously demonstrated.\\n\\n2.  **Interpretation of the Difference in the $s$-Domain:**\\n    *   **Issue:** If $F(s)$ and $G(s)$ represent the transforms of neural activity under two conditions, then $F(s) - G(s)$ represents the transform of the *difference* in activity. What features of this difference in the $s$-domain (e.g., specific peaks in magnitude, changes in phase, appearance/disappearance of \\\"poles\\\" or \\\"zeros\\\" in the difference function) are indicative of specific cognitive computations (e.g., stimulus processing, decision boundary crossing)?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** The paper needs to map these $s$-domain features directly to testable hypotheses about neural computation in the recurrent layer. Vague interpretations should be avoided.\\n\\n**D. Analysis of Neural Activity in the Recurrent Layer**\\n\\n1.  **Feature Extraction from $F(s)$:**\\n    *   What specific features are extracted from the complex $F(s)$? (e.g., magnitude $|F(s)|$, phase $\\\\angle F(s)$, poles, zeros, specific values at critical $s$).\\n    *   **Issue:** How are these features quantified and compared across conditions or units? Are statistical tests applied? How are \\\"significant\\\" features identified?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Precisely define the metrics derived from $F(s)$.\\n\\n2.  **Linking $s$-Domain Features to Cognitive Processes:**\\n    *   The paper aims to \\\"characterize neural representation\\\" during an \\\"evidence accumulation task.\\\"\\n    *   **Issue:** How do the extracted Laplace features (e.g., magnitude at specific $s$, pole locations) relate to known cognitive mechanisms of evidence accumulation (e.g., integration, leaky integration, thresholding, noise)? For example, does a specific pole location correspond to the time constant of a leaky integrator?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Build a strong theoretical connection between the $s$-domain properties and the computational principles of evidence accumulation. Provide evidence that these features are indeed related to the cognitive function, perhaps by perturbing the agent or the task and observing corresponding changes in the Laplace domain.\\n\\n3.  **Robustness and Noise Sensitivity:**\\n    *   **Issue:** Numerical transforms, especially the inverse Laplace transform, can be highly sensitive to noise in the input data. Neural activity is inherently noisy. How robust is the proposed framework to noise in the RNN activations?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Perform sensitivity analysis. Show how the extracted features in the $s$-domain change with varying levels of noise or small perturbations in the time-domain activity.\\n\\n**E. Computational Efficiency**\\n\\n1.  **Cost of Transformation:**\\n    *   **Issue:** Computing $F(s)$ for a wide range of complex $s$ values using numerical integration can be computationally intensive, especially if applied to many units or many trials.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Provide computational complexity analysis. Compare the run-time against alternative, more conventional time-series analysis methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, direct regression, dynamical systems modeling).\\n\\n2.  **Scalability:**\\n    *   **Issue:** How does the method scale with the number of recurrent units, trial length, or dataset size?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Discuss scalability. If the method is computationally expensive, its practical utility for large-scale neural network analysis might be limited.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Weighted Recommendation: Major Revision**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe proposed \\\"Laplace framework\\\" holds interesting theoretical potential for analyzing the dynamics of deep RL agents.

This is mathematically consistent.\\n    *   **Option 2 (If Laplace is insisted upon): Justify mapping:** If the continuous Laplace transform is absolutely necessary (e.g., to bridge to continuous control theory), rigorously define the mapping from discrete time to continuous time (e.g., impulse sampling, zero-order hold, or bilinear transform) and clearly explain its impact on the $s$-plane. Discuss the implications for causality and initial conditions.\\n    *   **Finite-time Handling:** Explicitly state how the finite duration of neural activity is managed (e.g., windowing, zero-padding) and its impact on the resulting $F(s)$ (e.g., spectral leakage, smearing of features).\\n    *   **Numerical Methods:** Detail the numerical integration or spectral methods used to compute $F(s)$ for specific $s$ values. Justify the choice of complex $s$ values explored.\\n\\n2.  **Clarify Analytical Value of $s$-Domain Operations:**\\n    *   For the \\\"subtraction of functions in the Laplace domain,\\\" clearly articulate *why* this provides a unique or superior insight compared to simply analyzing the Laplace transform of the time-domain difference.

Show that the Laplace framework correctly recovers the underlying parameters.\\n    *   **Noise Analysis:** Evaluate the robustness of the extracted $s$-domain features to typical levels of noise in the RNN activations.\\n    *   **Comparison:** If possible, compare the insights gained from the Laplace framework with those from more established time-series analysis techniques (e.g., state-space models, frequency-domain analysis using FFT, Granger causality).

The core idea is to train deep RL agents on a task known to evoke specific cognitive processes (evidence accumulation) and then analyze their internal \"neural\" representations to see if they recapitulate known neurophysiological phenomena. This approach has significant potential to bridge the gap between abstract cognitive models, biologically detailed neuroscience, and powerful deep learning architectures.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed review focusing on the cognitive science aspects:\\n\\n## Overall Impression\\n\\nThe paper tackles an important and challenging problem: understanding how high-performing artificial neural networks might implement cognitive functions, and whether insights from their internal workings can inform our understanding of biological brains. By choosing the well-characterized evidence accumulation paradigm, the authors provide a strong foundation for comparison. The detailed analysis of internal representations is commendable and moves beyond mere behavioral matching, which is crucial for making neuroscience-relevant claims. While promising, the interpretation of \"cognitively-inspired\" elements and the depth of the neuroscience comparisons could be strengthened to fully realize the paper\\'s potential.\\n\\n## Strengths from a Cognitive Science Perspective\\n\\n1.  **Bridging Deep RL and Cognitive Models:** The paper directly addresses a critical area of research: whether and how deep learning models can embody cognitive principles. By attempting to \"reverse-engineer\" cognitive functions from trained RL agents, it offers a novel approach to understanding intelligence, both artificial and biological.\\n2.  **Appropriate Task Selection:** The evidence accumulation task (e.g., two-alternative forced choice with noisy input) is an excellent choice. It has a rich history in cognitive psychology (Drift Diffusion Model, Sequential Sampling Models) and well-established neural correlates (e.g., ramping activity in parietal cortex, LIP). This provides clear benchmarks for evaluating the \"cognitively-inspired\" aspects.\\n3.  **Focus on Internal Representations:** Moving beyond just behavioral replication, the paper delves into the internal states of the deep RL agent. Analyzing hidden layer activity for signatures of evidence accumulation, decision boundaries, and value signals is essential for making claims about cognitive plausibility and neural similarity. This is a significant step forward from papers that only compare input-output behavior.\\n4.  **Relevance of Analytical Methods:** The use of dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) and linear decoding to extract meaningful variables (accumulated evidence, decision variable, value) from high-dimensional neural activity is directly analogous to methods used in computational neuroscience to analyze real brain data. This enhances the direct comparability of the findings.\\n5.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The work can serve as a powerful tool for generating new hypotheses about neural mechanisms. If certain \"cognitive\" dynamics consistently emerge in well-performing RL agents, it suggests these might be efficient or necessary computations for the task, providing targets for experimental neuroscience.\\n\\n## Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement (Cognitive Science Focus)\\n\\n1.  **Validity and Specificity of \"Cognitively-Inspired\":**\\n    *   **Vague Definition:** The term \"cognitively-inspired\" needs precise definition. Does it mean the RL agent\\'s architecture *explicitly includes* components designed to mimic DDM-like processes (e.g., a dedicated accumulator unit, a boundary-crossing mechanism)? Or does it mean a standard deep RL agent *emerges* DDM-like dynamics through training on the task? The latter is a much stronger and more interesting claim for the power of general RL. If it\\'s the former, the paper needs to clearly outline the architectural \"inspiration\" and how it\\'s implemented. Without this clarity, it\\'s hard to assess how much of the observed phenomena are a direct result of the design vs. emergent properties.\\n    *   **Lack of Control Condition:** A major missing piece is a comparison to a \"non-cognitively-inspired\" or \"vanilla\" deep RL agent trained on the *exact same task*. Does a standard RNN-based deep RL agent, without any explicit cognitive architectural biases, also spontaneously develop similar internal representations (ramping activity, decision boundaries)? If so, it would suggest that these dynamics are an *inherent solution* to the task structure, rather than requiring specific \"inspiration.\" This comparison is crucial for establishing the added value and significance of the \"cognitively-inspired\" component.\\n\\n2.  **Biological Plausibility and Interpretation of \"Neural\" Representations:**\\n    *   **Granularity Mismatch:** While the *dynamics* (e.g., ramping activity) may resemble neural activity, the underlying \"units\" (neurons in the agent) are often abstract, high-dimensional vectors. Interpreting a decoded \"evidence accumulation\" axis in a latent space as directly equivalent to the firing rate of a neuron population in LIP requires careful nuance. The paper needs to explicitly discuss the limitations of mapping abstract network activations to biological neuronal activity.\\n    *   **Distributed vs. Localized Representations:** Biological brains often use distributed representations, but specific computations can be localized or emerge from population dynamics. The paper should discuss whether the identified \"neural correlates\" in the agent are localized to specific modules (if any exist due to inspiration) or are distributed throughout the network. How does this align with biological observations?\\n    *   **Mechanism vs. Phenomenon:** The paper shows *phenomena* (ramping activity) consistent with cognitive models. Does it offer insights into the *mechanisms* that *produce* these phenomena within the deep RL framework? For example, what specific learning rules, architectural choices, or loss functions drive the emergence of DDM-like behavior or neural dynamics?\\n\\n3.  **Depth of Neuroscience Comparison:**\\n    *   **Beyond Qualitative Similarity:** While showing qualitative similarity (e.g., \"ramping activity similar to LIP\"), the paper could benefit from more quantitative comparisons to neurophysiological data. For example, comparing the *slopes* of accumulation, the *variability* in accumulation, or the *timing* of decision boundary crossings to empirical data.\\n    *   **Lack of Causal Manipulations:** In neuroscience, lesion studies or optogenetic manipulations are used to establish causal roles of brain regions. Can similar \"lesion\" or \"perturbation\" studies be performed on the \"cognitively-inspired\" components of the RL agent? For example, if the \"accumulator\" units are identified, what happens to behavior and other \"neural\" activity if they are silenced or their dynamics are altered? This would provide stronger evidence for their functional role.\\n    *   **Other Relevant Brain Regions:** While LIP is a primary candidate for accumulation, other areas (e.g., FEF for motor plans, basal ganglia for decision-making and value, prefrontal cortex for control) also play crucial roles in decision-making tasks. Does the agent show any emergent properties resembling the roles of these other areas?\\n\\n4.  **Novelty of Cognitive Insights:** Does this work provide truly *new* insights into human cognition, or does it primarily show that deep RL can *reproduce* known cognitive phenomena? To have a significant impact, it should ideally offer testable predictions for human behavior or brain activity that weren\\'t obvious from existing cognitive models alone. For example, does it suggest specific failure modes or biases in decision-making that mirror human errors?\\n\\n## Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Weighted Recommendation: Accept with Major Revisions**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe paper is conceptually strong and explores a highly relevant and promising research direction. The detailed analysis of internal representations is a significant strength. However, the current presentation lacks crucial controls and clarity around the \"cognitively-inspired\" aspect, which limits the interpretability and significance of its findings for cognitive science. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above would substantially enhance the paper\\'s scientific rigor and impact.\\n\\n## Improvement Pathways\\n\\n1.  **Clarify \"Cognitively-Inspired\" Implementation:**\\n    *   Explicitly detail the architecture of the \"cognitively-inspired\" RL agent. If there are dedicated modules or specific loss functions derived from cognitive models, describe them precisely.\\n    *   If the \"inspiration\" is more subtle (e.g., certain network motifs or training regimes that encourage DDM-like behavior), state this clearly and provide justification.\\n\\n2.  **Introduce a Strong Control Condition:**\\n    *   **Crucially, train a \"vanilla\" deep RL agent (e.g., a standard A2C/PPO agent with an RNN backbone but *without* explicit cognitive architectural biases) on the exact same evidence accumulation task.**\\n    *   Perform the *same* internal representation analyses on this control agent.\\n    *   Compare the behavioral performance and internal \"neural\" dynamics of the cognitively-inspired agent directly against the vanilla agent. This will clearly demonstrate whether the \"inspiration\" is necessary for the observed phenomena or if they emerge naturally from the task structure. This is perhaps the *most important* revision.\\n\\n3.  **Deepen Neuroscience Comparisons:**\\n    *   **Quantify Similarities:** Instead of just qualitative observations, quantify the similarity of ramping activity (e.g., compare slopes, onset times, peak magnitudes) and other dynamics to published neurophysiological data.\\n    *   **Ablation/Perturbation Studies:** Systematically \"lesion\" or perturb the identified \"cognitive\" units or pathways within the agent (e.g., by zeroing out activations, adding noise, or modifying weights). Observe the resulting changes in behavior (RT, accuracy, error types) and other internal representations. This would provide causal evidence for the role of these components, directly mirroring neuroscience experiments.\\n    *   **Multi-Region Analogy:** If the agent has multiple emergent \"neural\" properties, consider drawing analogies to other brain regions involved in decision-making (e.g., pre-motor areas, basal ganglia) beyond just LIP.\\n\\n4.  **Strengthen Cognitive Interpretation:**\\n    *   **Novel Predictions:** Clearly articulate any novel, testable predictions about human cognition or brain activity that arise from the model. Does it explain any known cognitive biases or individual differences?\\n    *   **Mechanistic Insights:** Beyond *what* is represented, discuss *how* these representations might emerge from the deep RL learning process (e.g., how the RL objective function shapes the internal dynamics to achieve optimal decision-making).\\n    *   **Limitations and Generalizability:** Acknowledge the current limitations regarding biological realism and the generalizability of the \"cognitively-inspired\" elements to other cognitive tasks. Discuss future directions, such as incorporating more biological constraints (e.g., spiking neurons, specific synaptic plasticity rules) or applying the framework to a wider range of cognitive tasks.\\n\\n5.  **Refine Language and Argumentation:** Ensure that the claims made about \"neural representations\" are appropriately nuanced, acknowledging the abstract nature of deep network units while still highlighting their potential as models for brain function. Avoid overstating the direct mapping between artificial and biological neurons.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the paper can move from a promising preliminary exploration to a robust contribution that significantly advances our understanding of the computational underpinnings of cognitive processes in both artificial and biological systems.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.9105417}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'This paper aims to characterize the neural representations of cognitively-inspired Deep RL agents performing an evidence accumulation task.

The core idea of using RL agents as models for cognitive processes is sound and promising. However, several aspects concerning the RL methodology, experimental design, and the clarity of baselines require significant revision to strengthen the claims and improve the paper\\'s rigor.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Detailed RL Specific Feedback:\\n\\n1.  **Appropriateness of the RL Architecture (A2C):**\\n    *   **Strength:** A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) is a reasonable choice for this type of problem. It\\'s an on-policy algorithm, which means it directly optimizes the policy based on current experience, making the learned trajectories and internal states potentially more interpretable as they reflect the agent\\'s current decision-making process. The separation of actor (policy) and critic (value function) allows for an explicit representation of what the agent believes about action probabilities and future rewards, which can be valuable for cognitive modeling. A2C\\'s relative stability and simplicity compared to some off-policy methods also make it a practical choice for initial investigations.\\n    *   **Weakness/Improvement:** While A2C is appropriate, the paper could benefit from a brief justification for its selection over other popular policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO, which is often preferred for its empirical performance and stability) or value-based methods (e.g., DQN for discrete action spaces, though less directly interpretable as a policy). Is there a specific cognitive hypothesis A2C serves better? For instance, PPO might achieve higher performance or faster convergence, which could be relevant even if the primary goal isn\\'t SOTA. Given the interpretability goal, exploring if the separate value function in A2C (vs. a single-head PPO) offers unique insights could be a point of discussion.\\n\\n2.  **Training Methodology:**\\n    *   **Clarity on Hyperparameters:** The paper should provide a comprehensive table of all RL-specific hyperparameters used for A2C (learning rate, `gamma`/discount factor, `n_steps` for A2C, entropy coefficient, GAE `lambda` if used, optimizer type, gradient clipping, number of parallel environments, total training steps/episodes, batch size for updates).\\n        *   **`gamma` (Discount Factor):** For an evidence accumulation task, the choice of `gamma` is critical. If `gamma` is too low, the agent might only care about immediate rewards, potentially leading to suboptimal long-term strategies, especially if there\\'s a time cost or varying reward for faster decisions. If the task is sequential and the \"right\" decision is revealed eventually, a `gamma` closer to 1.0 makes sense. Justify the chosen value.\\n        *   **Entropy Coefficient:** This parameter significantly influences exploration. A higher entropy coefficient encourages more stochastic policies, which might be desirable for modeling human variability or for initial exploration. Its effect on the learned policy and representations should be considered.\\n    *   **Convergence Criteria:** How was convergence determined? Was training stopped after a fixed number of steps, or when performance plateaued? Showing learning curves (average reward per episode, accuracy over training steps) would be highly beneficial to demonstrate that agents indeed learned the task and converged.\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Clearly state the number of random seeds used for training and whether results are averaged across these seeds. This is crucial for assessing the robustness and statistical significance of findings.\\n\\n3.  **Comparison with RNN and GRU Baselines (Crucial Clarification Needed):**\\n    *   **Fundamental Misrepresentation/Ambiguity:** This is the most critical area for improvement. The phrasing \"comparison with RNN and GRU baselines\" suggests that RNNs and GRUs are *alternative RL agents* or *non-RL baselines*. However, based on typical RL agent design, RNNs/GRUs (and LSTMs) are often used as the *recurrent backbone* within the deep neural network architecture of an RL agent (e.g., A2C).\\n    *   **Proposed Clarification:** It needs to be unequivocally stated whether the \"RNN\" and \"GRU\" agents are:\\n        1.  **A2C agents whose *internal recurrent module* is an RNN or GRU (versus an LSTM, which is often the default).** If this is the case, then the paper is comparing different recurrent cell types *within the A2C framework*, which is a valid and interesting architectural comparison for a sequential task. This seems to be the most likely interpretation given the title \"cognitively-inspired deep RL agents.\"\\n        2.  **Purely supervised learning models (e.g., trained on expert trajectories) using RNN/GRU architectures, *not* trained with RL.** If this were the case, the comparison would be fundamentally different and less relevant to the \"RL agent\" claim.\\n    *   **Impact:** Assuming interpretation #1, the paper should clearly state that it is comparing A2C agents with different recurrent cell types (e.g., \"A2C-RNN,\" \"A2C-GRU,\" \"A2C-LSTM\"). This makes the architectural comparison meaningful. If it\\'s interpretation #2, then the entire premise of \"RL agents\" as baselines is flawed.\\n    *   **Lack of \"Standard RL Agent\" Baselines:** The prompt specifically asked about \"comparison with standard RL agents.\" If the paper\\'s goal is primarily cognitive modeling, then comparing A2C to other RL *algorithms* (e.g., PPO, SAC, DQN) might not be strictly necessary for *this* paper\\'s specific aim. However, it\\'s a common expectation in RL literature. If not included, the paper should explicitly state that the focus is on architectural variations within a chosen RL paradigm (A2C) for cognitive modeling, rather than a benchmark comparison of RL algorithms. This would manage reader expectations.\\n\\n4.  **Soundness of Experimental Design & Statistical Significance:**\\n    *   **Number of Seeds:** The paper must report the number of independent training runs (seeds) for each agent type. Without multiple seeds, any observed differences in performance or neural representations could be due to random initialization or training stochasticity, not genuine architectural differences.\\n    *   **Reporting Variance:** All quantitative results (accuracy, RT, reward) should be reported with measures of variance (e.g., standard deviation, standard error) across seeds.\\n    *   **Statistical Tests:** When comparing performance or any quantitative metric between agent types (RNN vs. GRU vs. LSTM), appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) should be employed to determine if observed differences are statistically significant. Simply showing bar plots without error bars or p-values is insufficient.\\n    *   **Task Complexity:** Is the evidence accumulation task sufficiently challenging for the agents? If it\\'s too simple, all agents might achieve near-perfect performance, obscuring any meaningful differences in learning or representation. Conversely, if it\\'s too hard, none might learn effectively. Characterizing the task difficulty would be beneficial.\\n\\n5.  **Appropriateness of Evaluation Metrics:**\\n    *   **RL-Specific Metrics:**\\n        *   **Reward Accumulation:** Average cumulative reward per episode/trial is a fundamental RL metric.\\n        *   **Policy Performance:** Accuracy (for correct vs. incorrect decisions) is highly relevant for a decision-making task.\\n        *   **Reaction Time (RT):** Given it\\'s an evidence accumulation task, RT is a crucial metric, mirroring human cognitive psychology. Analyzing RT distributions (e.g., drift-diffusion model fit) for agents can directly compare to human data.\\n    *   **Cognitive Modeling Metrics:** The paper\\'s strength lies in its \"neural representation\" analysis (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, RSA). These are appropriate for the cognitive modeling goal.\\n    *   **Improvement:** For a \"cognitively-inspired\" agent, explicitly comparing agent behavior (e.g., RT distributions, accuracy as a function of evidence strength) to known human behavioral patterns in evidence accumulation tasks (e.g., those fit by Drift-Diffusion Models) would significantly strengthen the paper\\'s claims of cognitive plausibility. This would move beyond just showing the agents *can* do the task, to showing they do it *like humans*.\\n\\n### Improvement Pathways:\\n\\n1.  **Clarify Baselines:** Explicitly state that RNN/GRU/LSTM are different recurrent *architectures within the A2C framework*, rather than distinct RL algorithms or non-RL baselines. Rename them (e.g., A2C-RNN, A2C-GRU, A2C-LSTM).\\n2.  **Detail RL Training:** Provide a dedicated section or table for all RL hyperparameters. Justify the choice of `gamma` and entropy coefficient in the context of the task.\\n3.  **Demonstrate Learning:** Include learning curves (reward/accuracy vs. training steps) for all agent types to show convergence and learning progress.\\n4.  **Strengthen Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   Specify the number of random seeds used for training each agent.\\n    *   Report all quantitative results with standard deviations or standard errors across seeds.\\n    *   Apply appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) when comparing performance or other metrics between agent types and report p-values.\\n5.  **Behavioral Validation against Human Data:** To bolster the \"cognitively-inspired\" claim, analyze the agent\\'s behavior (e.g., RT distributions, accuracy as a function of evidence) and discuss how it aligns or deviates from human behavioral data in similar evidence accumulation tasks. This could involve fitting DDM-like parameters to agent data.\\n6.  **Acknowledge RL Algorithm Choice:** Briefly discuss why A2C was chosen over other RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC), even if it\\'s primarily for convenience or specific interpretability benefits, given the cognitive modeling goal.\\n7.  **Discuss Limitations:** Acknowledge limitations, such as the specific evidence accumulation task, the choice of A2C, and potential discrepancies between agent \"representations\" and biological neural activity.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, especially the critical clarification regarding the baselines and the enhancement of statistical reporting, the paper\\'s scientific merit and impact would be significantly improved.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.9096357}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'This review will rigorously examine the application of the \"Laplace framework\" to analyze neural activity in deep RL agents, as described in the paper \"Characterizing neural representation of cognitively-inspired deep RL agents during an evidence accumulation task.\" Since I do not have the specific paper to hand, my analysis will proceed based on the common pitfalls and nuances associated with applying the continuous-time Laplace transform to discrete neural data, and the general mathematical principles involved.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment**\\n\\nThe ambition to apply tools from system identification, such as the Laplace transform, to analyze the dynamics of neural representations in deep RL agents is commendable. Such an approach could potentially offer novel insights into the underlying \"computational primitives\" or \"transfer functions\" of these artificial neural networks, akin to how it\\'s used in control theory to characterize physical systems. However, the application of the continuous-time Laplace transform to discrete, finite-duration neural activity, and particularly the interpretation of operations in the Laplace domain, presents significant mathematical and computational challenges that often lead to misinterpretations or invalid conclusions if not handled with extreme rigor.\\n\\nBased on the prompt\\'s focus, the paper\\'s main contribution seems to revolve around using the Laplace transform as an analysis tool. My primary concern will be the *validity and utility* of this specific framework in the context of discrete neural data, and whether its application truly yields insights superior to or distinct from more traditional time-domain or frequency-domain analyses.\\n\\n**Strengths (Hypothetical, based on potential of the approach)**\\n\\n1.  **Novelty of Approach:** Applying the Laplace transform to analyze deep RL agent activations is relatively novel compared to more common methods like PCA, ICA, UMAP, or direct time-series analysis. This could open new avenues for understanding learned internal dynamics.\\n2.  **Potential for System-Level Understanding:** If implemented correctly, the Laplace domain could reveal characteristic poles, zeros, or transfer functions that describe how information is processed and transformed over time within the recurrent layer, potentially linking to concepts like integration time constants or resonant frequencies related to evidence accumulation.\\n3.  **Cross-Disciplinary Insight:** Bridging control theory/signal processing with neuroscience/AI could foster interdisciplinary insights.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement (Detailed Mathematical and Computational Analysis)**\\n\\nThe core of this review centers on the \"Laplace framework\" itself.\\n\\n**A. Mathematical Formulation of the Laplace Framework**\\n\\n1.  **Fundamental Mismatch: Continuous vs. Discrete Data:**\\n    *   **The Laplace Transform** ($\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt$) is inherently defined for *continuous-time* functions $f(t)$ and typically assumes the function starts at $t=0$ and extends to infinity.\\n    *   **Neural Activity:** The activity of neurons (or units in an RNN) is sampled at discrete time steps (e.g., $h_1, h_2, ..., h_T$). The \"neural representation\" is a sequence of vectors/scalars over a finite trial duration.\\n    *   **Issue:** How is $f(t)$ constructed from the discrete samples?\\n        *   **Interpolation?** If values are interpolated between samples, what interpolation scheme is used (e.g., zero-order hold, linear, cubic spline)? Each choice implies different frequency content and can introduce artifacts.\\n        *   **Direct Discretization?** Applying a numerical integration scheme (e.g., trapezoidal rule, Simpson\\'s rule) to the integral definition requires careful handling of the complex variable $s$.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** The paper *must* explicitly define how the continuous $f(t)$ is formed from discrete samples. If it\\'s simply treating discrete samples as continuous, this is a major conceptual flaw.\\n\\n2.  **Finite-Time Series and the Initial Condition Problem:**\\n    *   The Laplace transform assumes $t \\\\in [0, \\\\infty)$. Neural activity is finite-duration (e.g., one trial lasts $T$ timesteps).\\n    *   **Issue:** Truncating the integral introduces edge effects. The transform of a finite-duration signal $f(t)$ for $t \\\\in [0, T]$ is $\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\textbf{u}(t) - f(t)\\\\textbf{u}(t-T)\\\\}$, which is more complex than a simple $F(s)$. This affects the analytic properties of $F(s)$, potentially obscuring true system characteristics.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Acknowledge and justify how finite-duration signals are handled. If zero-padding is used beyond $T$, this assumes the activity drops to zero, which might not be biologically or computationally realistic.\\n\\n3.  **Appropriateness of $s$-Domain for RNNs (Discrete-Time Systems):**\\n    *   For discrete-time systems, the **Z-transform** is the natural counterpart to the Laplace transform. It maps sequences to the complex Z-plane ($Z\\\\{x[n]\\\\} = X(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty x[n]z^{-n}$).\\n    *   **Issue:** Using the Laplace transform on discrete data without a clear, rigorous mapping (e.g., the bilinear transform, which maps $s$ to $z$) can be problematic. The interpretation of poles and zeros in the $s$-plane for a system inherently defined in discrete time (the RNN) is not straightforward. Stability in discrete systems relates to poles inside the unit circle in the Z-plane, not the left half of the s-plane directly, unless a specific transformation is rigorously applied.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Justify why the continuous Laplace transform is chosen over the discrete Z-transform. If a mapping is used (e.g., $s = \\\\frac{2}{T_s} \\\\frac{z-1}{z+1}$), it must be explicitly stated and its implications discussed. Otherwise, the entire theoretical foundation might be flawed for discrete-time systems.\\n\\n**B. Discrete Implementation Details**\\n\\n1.  **Numerical Computation of the Laplace Transform:**\\n    *   How is $F(s)$ computed for specific values of $s$?\\n        *   **Direct Numerical Integration:** This involves discretizing the integral $\\\\int_0^T f(t)e^{-st} dt$. This is computationally expensive, especially for a range of complex $s$ values. The choice of integration method (e.g., Riemann sum, trapezoidal) impacts accuracy.\\n        *   **Relation to DFT/FFT:** For $s = j\\\\omega$ (i.e., along the imaginary axis), the Laplace transform becomes the Fourier transform. The FFT can efficiently compute the Fourier transform for discrete frequencies. If the paper only evaluates $F(s)$ on the imaginary axis, it\\'s essentially a Fourier analysis, not a full Laplace analysis, and it should be framed as such. If it evaluates $F(s)$ for $s = \\\\sigma + j\\\\omega$ (i.e., off the imaginary axis), direct numerical integration or specific numerical methods for complex contours are typically needed.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Provide explicit equations for how $F(s)$ is computed from the discrete neural activity $h[n]$. Detail the range of $s$ values explored and the computational method.\\n\\n2.  **Choice of $s$ Values and Interpretation:**\\n    *   The interpretation of $F(s)$ depends heavily on the chosen $s$ values.\\n    *   **Issue:** What values of $\\\\sigma$ (real part of $s$) and $\\\\omega$ (imaginary part of $s$) are chosen? How do these values relate to the dynamics of the RNN? For example, positive $\\\\sigma$ implies growing exponentials, negative $\\\\sigma$ implies decaying exponentials. What insights are gained by probing these specific regions of the $s$-plane?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Clearly state the sampling of the $s$-plane. Justify the choice of $\\\\sigma$ and $\\\\omega$ ranges. Explain what characteristic features (e.g., magnitude, phase, poles, zeros if identifiable) are extracted and what they signify in the context of neural dynamics or cognitive processes.\\n\\n3.  **Inverse Laplace Transform (if applicable):**\\n    *   If the goal is to transform to the $s$-domain, perform operations, and then transform back, the numerical inverse Laplace transform is notoriously difficult and ill-posed.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** If inverse transforms are performed, the method must be described in detail, and its stability and accuracy thoroughly validated.\\n\\n**C. Subtraction of Functions in the Laplace Domain**\\n\\n1.  **Mathematical Validity:**\\n    *   The linearity property of the Laplace transform states that $\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t) - g(t)\\\\} = F(s) - G(s)$. This identity is mathematically sound.\\n    *   **Issue:** The problem is rarely the identity itself, but rather the *purpose* and *interpretation* of performing the subtraction in the Laplace domain rather than in the time domain.\\n        *   If the goal is to analyze the difference $h_{cond1}[n] - h_{cond2}[n]$: It is generally simpler and more direct to compute the difference in the time domain ($h_{diff}[n] = h_{cond1}[n] - h_{cond2}[n]$) and then compute the Laplace transform of this difference function ($H_{diff}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h_{diff}[n]\\\\}$). This is equivalent to $F(s) - G(s)$.\\n        *   **What is gained?** If $F(s) - G(s)$ is computed, what specific insights does it provide that are not readily apparent from $h_{cond1}[n] - h_{cond2}[n]$? Does it highlight specific frequency components of the difference? Does it simplify the analysis of system \"modes\" related to the difference?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Clearly articulate the *analytical advantage* of subtracting in the Laplace domain. Why is it superior or complementary to time-domain subtraction followed by standard frequency or time-series analysis? For example, perhaps it cleanly isolates a specific \"mode\" or \"component\" of the dynamics associated with a particular cognitive process. If so, this needs to be rigorously demonstrated.\\n\\n2.  **Interpretation of the Difference in the $s$-Domain:**\\n    *   **Issue:** If $F(s)$ and $G(s)$ represent the transforms of neural activity under two conditions, then $F(s) - G(s)$ represents the transform of the *difference* in activity. What features of this difference in the $s$-domain (e.g., specific peaks in magnitude, changes in phase, appearance/disappearance of \"poles\" or \"zeros\" in the difference function) are indicative of specific cognitive computations (e.g., stimulus processing, decision boundary crossing)?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** The paper needs to map these $s$-domain features directly to testable hypotheses about neural computation in the recurrent layer. Vague interpretations should be avoided.\\n\\n**D. Analysis of Neural Activity in the Recurrent Layer**\\n\\n1.  **Feature Extraction from $F(s)$:**\\n    *   What specific features are extracted from the complex $F(s)$? (e.g., magnitude $|F(s)|$, phase $\\\\angle F(s)$, poles, zeros, specific values at critical $s$).\\n    *   **Issue:** How are these features quantified and compared across conditions or units? Are statistical tests applied? How are \"significant\" features identified?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Precisely define the metrics derived from $F(s)$.\\n\\n2.  **Linking $s$-Domain Features to Cognitive Processes:**\\n    *   The paper aims to \"characterize neural representation\" during an \"evidence accumulation task.\"\\n    *   **Issue:** How do the extracted Laplace features (e.g., magnitude at specific $s$, pole locations) relate to known cognitive mechanisms of evidence accumulation (e.g., integration, leaky integration, thresholding, noise)? For example, does a specific pole location correspond to the time constant of a leaky integrator?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Build a strong theoretical connection between the $s$-domain properties and the computational principles of evidence accumulation. Provide evidence that these features are indeed related to the cognitive function, perhaps by perturbing the agent or the task and observing corresponding changes in the Laplace domain.\\n\\n3.  **Robustness and Noise Sensitivity:**\\n    *   **Issue:** Numerical transforms, especially the inverse Laplace transform, can be highly sensitive to noise in the input data. Neural activity is inherently noisy. How robust is the proposed framework to noise in the RNN activations?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Perform sensitivity analysis. Show how the extracted features in the $s$-domain change with varying levels of noise or small perturbations in the time-domain activity.\\n\\n**E. Computational Efficiency**\\n\\n1.  **Cost of Transformation:**\\n    *   **Issue:** Computing $F(s)$ for a wide range of complex $s$ values using numerical integration can be computationally intensive, especially if applied to many units or many trials.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Provide computational complexity analysis. Compare the run-time against alternative, more conventional time-series analysis methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, direct regression, dynamical systems modeling).\\n\\n2.  **Scalability:**\\n    *   **Issue:** How does the method scale with the number of recurrent units, trial length, or dataset size?\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Discuss scalability. If the method is computationally expensive, its practical utility for large-scale neural network analysis might be limited.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Weighted Recommendation: Major Revision**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe proposed \"Laplace framework\" holds interesting theoretical potential for analyzing the dynamics of deep RL agents.

The burden of proof for the validity and utility of this novel application lies heavily on the authors.\\n\\n**Improvement Pathways:**\\n\\n1.  **Rigorous Mathematical Foundation:**\\n    *   **Option 1 (Preferred): Switch to Z-transform:** Argue for the Z-transform as the natural tool for discrete-time RNNs. Explain how to compute it and what its poles/zeros mean in the context of RNN dynamics (e.g., stability, time constants). This is mathematically consistent.\\n    *   **Option 2 (If Laplace is insisted upon): Justify mapping:** If the continuous Laplace transform is absolutely necessary (e.g., to bridge to continuous control theory), rigorously define the mapping from discrete time to continuous time (e.g., impulse sampling, zero-order hold, or bilinear transform) and clearly explain its impact on the $s$-plane. Discuss the implications for causality and initial conditions.\\n    *   **Finite-time Handling:** Explicitly state how the finite duration of neural activity is managed (e.g., windowing, zero-padding) and its impact on the resulting $F(s)$ (e.g., spectral leakage, smearing of features).\\n    *   **Numerical Methods:** Detail the numerical integration or spectral methods used to compute $F(s)$ for specific $s$ values. Justify the choice of complex $s$ values explored.\\n\\n2.  **Clarify Analytical Value of $s$-Domain Operations:**\\n    *   For the \"subtraction of functions in the Laplace domain,\" clearly articulate *why* this provides a unique or superior insight compared to simply analyzing the Laplace transform of the time-domain difference. Perhaps it highlights specific modes of difference or makes certain properties more evident. This should be a central point of the paper.\\n    *   Provide illustrative examples where the $s$-domain analysis unequivocally reveals something that is not easily seen in the time domain.\\n\\n3.  **Stronger Link to Cognitive Function:**\\n    *   Translate the $s$-domain features (e.g., specific pole locations, magnitude peaks, phase shifts) into concrete interpretations related to evidence accumulation mechanisms (e.g., \"this pole indicates a leakage time constant of X milliseconds,\" or \"this frequency band in $F(s)$ reflects the integration of sensory evidence\").\\n    *   Support these interpretations with controlled experiments on the RL agent (e.g., varying stimulus coherence, reward structure) and show how the $s$-domain features change predictably.\\n\\n4.  **Validation and Robustness:**\\n    *   **Synthetic Data:** Apply the framework to synthetic RNNs or simple linear systems with known transfer functions. Show that the Laplace framework correctly recovers the underlying parameters.\\n    *   **Noise Analysis:** Evaluate the robustness of the extracted $s$-domain features to typical levels of noise in the RNN activations.\\n    *   **Comparison:** If possible, compare the insights gained from the Laplace framework with those from more established time-series analysis techniques (e.g., state-space models, frequency-domain analysis using FFT, Granger causality).
