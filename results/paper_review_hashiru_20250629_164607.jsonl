The paper title is: GNNInterpreter: A Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation for Graph Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Graphs are widely used to model data in many applications such as chemistry, social science, transportation, etc. Since a graph is an unique non-Euclidean data structure, modeling graph data remained a challenging task until Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerged (Defferrard et al., 2016; Hamilton et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018). As a powerful tool for representation learning on graph data, GNN achieved state-of-the-art performance on various different machine learning tasks on graphs. As the popularity of GNNs rapidly increases, people begin to wonder why one should trust this model and how the model makes decisions. However, the complexity of GNNs prevents humans from interpreting the underlying mechanism in the model. The lack of self-explainability becomes a serious obstacle for applying GNNs to real-world problems, especially those when making wrong decisions may incur an unaffordable cost. Explaining deep learning models on text or image data (Simonyan et al., 2014; Selvaraju et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Binder et al., 2016) has been well-studied. However, the explainability of deep learning models on graphs is still less explored. Compared with explaining deep learning models on text or image data, explaining deep graph models is a more challenging task for several reasons (Yuan et al., 2020b): (i) the adjacency matrix representing the topological information has only discrete values, which cannot be directly optimized via gradient-based methods (Duval & Malliaros, 2021), (ii) in some application domains, a graph is valid only if it satisfies a set of domain-specific graph rules, so that generating a valid explanation graph to depicts the underlying decision-making process of GNNs is an nontrivial task, and (iii) graph data structure is heterogeneous in nature with different types of node features and edge features, which makes developing a one-size-fits-all explanation method for GNNs to be even more challenging. In recent years, explaining GNNs has aroused great interest and thus many research works have been conducted. The existing works can be classified into two categories: instance-level explanations (Luo et al., 2020; Ying et al., 2019; Vu & Thai, 2020) and model-level explanations (Yuan et al., 2020a). Instance-level explanation methods attempt to interpret the model prediction for a given graph instance, whereas model-level explanation methods aim at understanding the general behavior of the model not specific to any particular graph instance. However, if the ultimate goal is to examine the model reliability, instance-level methods are very time-consuming because one will need to examine many instances one by one to draw a rigorous conclusion about the model reliability. Conversely, the model-level explanation method can directly explain the high-level decision-making rule inside the blackbox (GNN) for a target prediction, which is much less time-consuming and more informative about the general decision-making process of the model. Besides, it has been shown that any instancelevel explanation method would fail to provide faithful explanation for a GNN that suffers from the bias attribution issue (Faber et al., 2021), while model-level explanation method can not only provide faithful explanation for this case but also diagnose the bias attribution issue. Even though the model-level explanation methods for GNNs have such advantages, they are much less explored than the instance-level explanation methods . In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model-level explanation method for GNNs, GNNInterpreter, which learns a generative explanation graph distribution that represents the most discriminative features the GNN tries to detect when making a certain prediction. Precisely, the explanation graph distribution are learned by optimizing a novel objective function specifically designed for model-level explanation of GNNs such that the generated explanation is both faithful and valid regarding the domain-specific knowledge. More importantly, GNNInterpreter is a general approach to generating explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features for explaining different GNNs which follows the message passing scheme. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of GNNInterpreter on four different datasets including synthetic datasets and public real-world dataset. The experimental results show that GNNInterpreter can precisely find the ideal topological structure for the target prediction if the explained model is ideal, and reveal the potential pitfalls in the model decision-making process if there is any. By identifying these potential model pitfalls, people can be mindful when applying this model to unseen graphs with a specific misleading pattern, which is especially important for some field in which making wrong decisions may incur an unaffordable cost. Compared with the current state-of-the-art model-level explanation method for GNNs, for example XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a), the quantitative and qualitative evaluation result shows that the explanation graphs generated by GNNInterpreter is more representative regarding the target class than the explanations generated by XGNN. Additionally, GNNInterpreter has the following advantages compared with XGNN: \u2022 GNNInterpreter is a more general approach that can generate explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features, whereas XGNN cannot generate graphs with continuous node features or any type of edge features. \u2022 By taking advantage of the special design of our objective function, GNNInterpreter is more flexible in explaining different GNN models without the need of having domain-specific knowledge for the specific task, whereas XGNN requires domain-specific knowledge to manually design the reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. \u2022 GNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient. For example, GNNInterpreter only takes less than a minute to explain one class in a GNN model, which is about 10 times faster than training a deep reinforcement learning agent as in XGNN. \u2022 GNNInterpreter is a numerical optimization approach without introducing another blackbox to explain GNNs, unlike XGNN which trains a deep learning model to explain GNNs. 2 RELATED WORK: Graph Neural Network. Unlike images and texts, modeling graph data is very challenging due to the unique characteristics of graphs. Tons of research has been conducted to extend the previously existing deep learning algorithms to graph data, which gives rise to the emergence of GNNs. GNNs have achieved remarkable success in different machine learning tasks including graph classification (Lee et al., 2018), node classification (Xu et al., 2019), and link prediction (Zhang & Chen, 2018). There exists a variety of GNN models (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018), but they often share a common idea of message passing as described in section 3 with different time complexity (Wu et al., 2020). Instance-Level Explanation of GNN. Encouraged by the success of explaining deep neural networks on image or text data, the first instance-level explanation method of GNNs (Pope et al., 2019) emerged in 2019. Since then, a multitude of instance-level explanation methods of GNNs has been proposed in the past few years. According to a recent survey (Yuan et al., 2020b), these instance-level explanation methods can be classified into four categories: gradient-based methods (Baldassarre & Azizpour, 2019), perturbation-based methods (Ying et al., 2019), decomposition methods (Schwarzenberg et al., 2019), and surrogate methods (Vu & Thai, 2020; Huang et al., 2020). These four categories all attempt to explain how a GNN model makes such a prediction for a specific input instance. However, if the ultimate goal is to validate whether this model is trustworthy, it is very time-consuming to manually check the instance-level explanation for many graph instances one by one before we can make any rigorous conclusion about the model reliability. Besides, all of them will fail to provide faithful explanation for a GNN model suffering from the bias attribution issue because the ground truth explanation edges for one of classes in this case will be an empty set (Faber et al., 2021). Model-Level Explanation Method of GNN. Unlike instance-level explanation methods, model-level explanation methods aim to explain the general behavior of a model without respect to any specific input. The current state-of-the-art model-level explanation method for GNNs is called XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a). Similar to the most of model-level explanation methods for other deep learning model (Simonyan et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015), XGNN and GNNInterpreter share a common goal of generating explanation graphs to maximize the likelihood of the target prediction being made by the GNN model. However, XGNN adopts a completely different approach. To be more concrete, given a target class c, XGNN trains a deep graph generator fc, which generates graphs by adding one edge at a step, in a reinforcement learning setting. After training is done, fc is able to construct input graphs that attempts to maximize the score of class c in a pre-defined number of steps. Besides, it incorporates hand-crafted graph rules into the reward function so that fc can consider these rules when providing explanations. However, specifying these graph rules requires domain-specific knowledge about the task. XGNN also has a limitation that it can only generate explanation graphs with a single categorical node feature or no node feature. In other words, it cannot generate explanation graphs with any types of edge features or continuous node features. Unlike XGNN, GNNInterpreter is a much more general approach that can generate explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, GNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient, because for each class to be explained, XGNN trains a reinforcement learning model, while GNNInterpreter directly optimizes a generative distribution. 3 BACKGROUND: Notations. A graph is represented as G = (V,E), where V and E are the sets of nodes and edges. Besides, the number of edges and nodes are denoted as M and N respectively. The topological information of a graph is described by an adjacency matrix A \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7N where aij = 1 if there exists an edge between node i and node j, and aij = 0 otherwise. In addition, the node feature matrix X \u2208 RN\u00d7kV and edge feature matrix Z \u2208 RM\u00d7kE represent the features for N nodes and M edges. Graph Neural Networks. In general, the high-level idea of GNN is message passing. For each layer, it aggregates information from neighboring nodes to learn the representation of each node. For hidden layer i, the message passing operation can be written as{ H0 = X, Hi = f(Hi\u22121,A,Z), (1) where Hi \u2208 RN\u00d7F i is the hidden node representation output from ith layer and F i is the output feature dimension. The propagation rule f can be decomposed into three components: computing the messages according to the node embedding at the previous layer Hi\u22121, aggregating the messages from neighboring nodes, and updating the hidden representation Hi for each node based upon the aggregated message. It is worth mentioning that GNNInterpreter can explain different GNNs that follow this message passing scheme. 4 GNNINTERPRETER: In this paper, we propose a model-level explanation method, GNNInterpreter, which is capable of disclosing the high-level decision-making process of the model for the purpose of examining model reliability. GNNInterpreter is a numerical optimization approach that is model-agnostic for explaining different GNNs as long as it follows the message passing scheme. Besides, it can generate explanation graphs with different types of edge features and node features. Specifically, we design a novel objective function for generating model-level explanation for GNNs, so that optimizing this objective function will result in both faithful and valid explanation graphs. That is to say, the generated explanation not only captures the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect when making a certain prediction, but also is a valid graph satisfying the domain-specific graph rules. Due to the discreteness nature of graph data, we learn a generative explanation graph distribution by adopting the Gumbel-Softmax trick (Maddison et al., 2016). 4.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE: To reveal the high-level decision-making process of the model, one effective approach is to construct a explanation graph that can trigger a specific response from the model as much as possible. Similar to most of the model-level explanation methods for other deep learning models (Simonyan et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015), the explanation for GNNs can be obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the explanation graph G being predicted as a target class by the GNN model. However, solely maximizing the likelihood without constraints may not necessarily result in meaningful explanations. This is because a local maxima in the objective landscape may lie outside of the training data distribution. The explanation yielded from this type of maxima are mathematically legitimate but may provide no meaningful insights on how the model actually reasons over the true data distribution. Especially when there exists domain-specific knowledge that restricts the validity of the data, the explanations are expected to stay inside the hard boundary of the true data distribution. XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a) addresses this problem by manually specifying a set of graph rules and evaluating the validity of explanation graphs according to the specified rules as a part of the reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. The essential goal is to confine the distribution of the explanation graphs to the domain-specific boundary. Nevertheless, manually specifying rules not only is tedious and time-consuming, but also requires domain expertise which is not always available. Moreover, in many cases, the rules over data distribution can not even be programmatically specified. Therefore, we propose to leverage the abstract knowledge learned by the GNN itself to prevent the explanation from deviating from the true data distribution. This can be achieved by maximizing the similarity between the explanation graph embedding and the average embedding of all graphs from the target class in the training set. Thus, we mathematically formulate our learning objective as follows, max G L(G) = max A,Z,X L(A,Z,X) = max A,Z,X \u03d5c(A,Z,X) + \u00b5simcos(\u03c8(A,Z,X), \u03c8\u0304c) (2) where L is the objective function; \u03d5c is the scoring function before Softmax corresponding to the class of interest c, predicted by the explained GNN; \u03c8 is the graph embedding function of the explained GNN; \u03c8\u0304c is the average graph embedding for all graphs belonging to class c in the training set; simcos denotes the cosine similarity; and \u00b5 is a hyper-parameter representing the weight factor. Given the learning objective defined above, one possible approach to obtain the explanation graph is that we can adopt the gradient ascent to iteratively update the explanation graphG toward maximizing the learning objective. However, this approach cannot be directly applied here because the discrete adjacency matrix A encoding the graph topology is non-differentiable, namely \u2207AL(A,Z,X) does not exist. Therefore, in order to adopt the gradient ascent method, A needs to be relaxed to a continuous variable. In addition, if the training graphs of the GNN model have discrete edge features or discrete node features, then Z and X are also required to be relaxed to the continuous domain such that \u2207ZL(A,Z,X) and \u2207XL(A,Z,X) exist. Given that the continuous edge features and continuous node features do not require any special accommodation to adopt the gradient ascent, we will only discuss how to learn a continuously relaxed explanation graph with discrete edge features and discrete node features in the following sections. 4.2 LEARNING GENERATIVE GRAPH DISTRIBUTION: To learn a probabilistic generative graph distribution such that the graph drawn from this distribution can maximize the learning objective, two assumptions have been made about the explanation graph. The first assumption is that the graph is a Gilbert random graph (Gilbert, 1959) in which every possible edge occurs independently with probability 0 < p < 1. The second assumption is that the features for each node and edge are independently distributed. Given these two assumptions, the probability distribution of the graph G, a random graph variable, can be factorized as P (G) = \u220f i\u2208V P (xi) \u00b7 \u220f (i,j)\u2208E P (zij)P (aij) (3) where aij = 1 when there exists an edge between node i and j and aij = 0 otherwise, zij denotes the edge feature between node i and j, and xi represents the node feature of node i. Intuitively, aij can be modeled as a Bernoulli distribution in which the probability of success \u03b8ij represents the probability of an edge existing between node i and j in G. For the discrete edge feature zij and the discrete node feature xi, we can assume that zij and xi follow a Categorical distribution, a generalized Bernoulli distribution, with the parameter specifying the probability of each possible outcome for the categorical node feature and the categorical edge feature. In summary, the probability distribution of aij , xi and zij can be written as aij \u223c Bernoulli(\u03b8ij), for aij \u2208 A and \u03b8ij \u2208 \u0398 zij \u223c Categorical(qij), for zij \u2208 Z and qij \u2208 Q xi \u223c Categorical(pi), for xi \u2208 X and pi \u2208 P (4) where \u2225qij\u22251 = 1 and \u2225pij\u22251 = 1. We define the number of edge categories kE = dim(qij) and the number of node categories kV = dim(pi). Thus, to learn the probabilistic distribution for explanation graphs, we can rewrite the learning objective as max G L(G) = max \u0398,Q,P EG\u223cP (G)[\u03d5c(A,Z,X) + \u00b5simcos(\u03c8(A,Z,X), \u03c8\u0304c)]. (5) 4.3 CONTINUOUS RELAXATION WITH REPARAMETERIZATION TRICK: To adopt gradient ascent over the learning objective function with respect to a graph with the discrete edge feature zij and the discrete node feature xi, we relax aij , zij and xi to continuous random variables a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i, respectively. Specifically, aij is relaxed to a\u0303ij \u2208 [0, 1]; zij is relaxed to z\u0303ij \u2208 [0, 1]kE , \u2225z\u0303ij\u22251 = 1; and xi is relaxed to x\u0303i \u2208 [0, 1]kV , \u2225x\u0303i\u22251 = 1. Given that the Concrete distribution (Maddison et al., 2016) is a family of continuous versions of Categorical random variables with closed form density, the distribution of continuously relaxed a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i can be written as a\u0303ij \u223c BinaryConcrete(\u03c9ij , \u03c4a), for a\u0303ij \u2208 A\u0303 and \u03c9ij \u2208 \u2126 z\u0303ij \u223c Concrete(\u03b7ij , \u03c4z), for z\u0303ij \u2208 Z\u0303 and \u03b7ij \u2208 H x\u0303i \u223c Concrete(\u03bei, \u03c4x), for x\u0303i \u2208 X\u0303 and \u03bei \u2208 \u039e (6) where \u03c4 \u2208 (0,\u221e) is the hyper-parameter representing the temperature, \u03c9ij = log(\u03b8ij/(1 \u2212 \u03b8ij), \u03b7ij = logqij , and \u03bei = logpi. As the temperature approaches zero, the Concrete distribution is mathematically equivalent to the Categorical distribution. However, in order to learn the generative explanation graph distribution, the sampling function for sampling a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i from the Concrete distribution is required to be differentiable. Thus, the reparametrization trick is adopted to approximate the sampling procedure of a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i by a differentiable function. Given an independent random variable \u03f5 \u223c Uniform(0,1), the sampling function with the reparameterization trick is as follows, a\u0303ij = sigmoid ((\u03c9ij + log \u03f5\u2212 log(1\u2212 \u03f5)) /\u03c4a) z\u0303ij = Softmax ((\u03b7ij \u2212 log(\u2212 log \u03f5)) /\u03c4z) x\u0303i = Softmax ((\u03beij \u2212 log(\u2212 log \u03f5)) /\u03c4x) . (7) Given this reparameterization trick, we can draw a sample a\u0303ij as an approximation of aij , where the probability of a\u0303ij to be close to 1 is the same as the probability of aij to equal 1 and vice versa. Specifically, P (a\u0303ij \u2192 1) = 1 \u2212 P (a\u0303ij \u2192 0) = P (aij = 1) = \u03b8ij = sigmoid(\u03c9ij). Similarly, z\u0303ij and x\u0303i drawn from the Concrete distribution as in Equation 7 is an approximation of zij and xi. Therefore, the learning objective with continuous relaxation and reparameterization trick can be approximated by the Monte Carlo method with K samples, max \u0398,Q,P EG\u223cP (G)[L(A,Z,X)] \u2248 max \u2126,H,\u039e E\u03f5\u223cU(0,1)[L(A\u0303, Z\u0303, X\u0303)] \u2248 max \u2126,H,\u039e 1 K K\u2211 k=1 L(A\u0303, Z\u0303, X\u0303). (8) In order to facilitate optimization and ensure that the explanation graphs are constrained to desired properties, we apply multiple regularization terms to the latent parameters (see details in Appendix A). Also, the detailed algorithm of GNNInterpreter is illustrated in Appendix B. 4.4 THE GENERALIZABILITY OF GNNINTERPRETER: GNNInterpreter can generate explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features if needed. If the node feature or edge feature is continuous, \u2207XL(A,Z,X) and \u2207ZL(A,Z,X) naturally exist, then we only need to relax the adjacency matrix A to a continuous random variable as in Equation 6. Additionally, unlike XGNN which can only learn graphs with a single categorical node feature, the number of edge features and node features are not limited in GNNInterpreter. GNNInterpreter can explain different GNNs following the message passing scheme. In the original message passing scheme, messages are aggregated from their neighbors to update the current node embedding. To adapt the message passing scheme for GNNInterpreter, messages are passed from all the other nodes but each message is weighted by \u03b8ij = sigmoid(\u03c9ij). Therefore, if \u03b8ij approaches to 1, meaning that node i and node j are highly likely to be the neighbor, the message passed between them will be the same as in the original message passing scheme. With this small modification, GNNInterpreter can be easily applied to different GNNs following the message passing scheme. 5 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: To comprehensively assess the effectiveness of GNNInterpreter, we carefully design experimental studies conducted on 4 datasets to demonstrate our flexibility of generating explanation graphs with various feature types and manifests our capability of explaining different GNNs. Specifically, we train a GNN classifier for each dataset and adopt GNNInterpreter to explain. In addition, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare the efficacy of GNNInterpreter with XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a). Details about the experiments and synthetic datasets generation are presented in Appendix F,G,H, and I. 5.1 DATASETS: Synthetic Dataset. We synthetically generate 3 datasets which are Cyclicity, Motif, and Shape (see Table 1). (1) In Cyclicity, the graphs have an categorical edge feature with 2 possible values: green or red. There are 3 class labels in Cyclicity, which are Red-Cyclic graphs, Green-Cyclic graphs, and Acyclic graphs. Specifically, a graph will be labeled as a green/red cyclic graph only if it is cyclic and the edges forming that cycle are all green/red. If a graph is categorized as Acyclic, then it either does not contain a cycle at all or contains a cycle but with a mixture of green and red edges. (2) The graphs in Motif are labeled according to whether they contain a certain motif. There are 4 motifs (i.e., House, House-X, Complete-4, and Complete-5) will possibly appear in the graphs and each motif corresponds to one class label. There is another class that contains the graphs without any special motif. Besides, each node in the graphs has a categorical node feature with 5 possible values: red, orange, green, blue, and purple. (3) Shape contains 5 classes of graphs: Lollipop, Wheel, Grid, Star, and Others. In all the classes except the Others class, graphs are generated with the corresponding shape. For the Others class, graphs are randomly generated without any special topology. Real-world Dataset. MUTAG (Kersting et al., 2016) is a real-world dataset with 2 classes: Mutagen and Nonmutagen. Each molecule graph is categorized according to its mutagenic effect (Debnath et al., 1991). Given the fact that the molecules with more NO2 are more likely to mutate, the graphs in the Mutagen class tend to have more NO2 than those in the Nonmutagen class. Besides, the Mutagen class and the Nonmutagen class share a common feature which is rings of carbon atoms. 5.2 RESULTS: To investigate whether we can truly explain the high-level decision-making process, we evaluated GNNInterpreter both quantitatively and qualitatively. Following XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a), the class probability of the explanation graphs predicted by the GNN is adopted as the quantitative metric since GNNInterpreter and XGNN share a common objective of maximizing the target class score (Table 2). Also, to qualitatively evaluate GNNInterpreter, we present one explanation graph per class for all datasets in Figure 1, which are all predicted as the target class with the class probability of 1. Due to the page limit, more explanation graphs per class per dataset are presented in Appendix E. Since XGNN is the current state-of-the-art model-level explanation method for GNNs, we compare GNNInterpreter with XGNN quantitatively and qualitatively. However, given that XGNN cannot generate explanation graphs with edge features, XGNN is not applicable to the Cyclicity dataset. For Motif and Shape, we attempted to adopt XGNN to explain the corresponding GNNs, but the explanation results were not acceptable even after our extensive efforts of trial-and-error on XGNN. Therefore, for a fair comparison, we only present the evaluation results of XGNN on the GNN trained on MUTAG, with the same hyper-parameter settings for MUTAG as they discussed in their paper. In addition to these 4 datasets, we also conducted experiments on the Is_Acyclic dataset synthesized by XGNN authors, but we failed to reproduce similar results claimed in the XGNN paper. The details of our comparative study on Is_Acyclic dataset against XGNN can be found in Appendix C. MUTAG. The quantitative evaluation in Table 2 shows that all explanation graphs generated by GNNInterpreter are classified correctly with 100% probability for both classes with zero variance, which indicates that we can consistently generate the most representative explanation graphs in terms of the explained GNN for all three classes. On the contrary, the GNN is more hesitant or diffident when classifying the XGNN explanation graphs for both classes. Speaking of the time efficiency, for explaining the same GNN model trained on MUTAG, we can generate an explanation graph about 10 times faster than XGNN on average (see Table 2). In Figure 1, the GNNInterpreter explanation for Mutagen class contains 5 repeated NO2 whereas the GNNInterpreter explanation for Nonmutagen class does not contain O atom at all, which are perfectly aligned with our background knowledge about the MUTAG dataset mentioned in subsection 5.1. In contrast, the XGNN explanation for Mutagen class only contains a single NO2, which is a less accurate or ideal explanation than ours. In addition, according to our explanation graphs for both classes, they indicate that the GNN trained with MUTAG is likely to suffer from the bias attribution issue (Faber et al., 2021) because the explanation graph for Nonmutagen class does not contain any special pattern but achieve the class probability of 1. This finding is further verified by the additional experiments we conducted (see subsection D.2). Cyclicity. In addition to the good quantitative performance shown in Table 2, the explanation graphs for Red Cyclic and Green Cyclic only contain multiple red cycles and multiple green cycles, respectively; the explanation graph for Acyclic does not contain any cycle with homogeneous edge colors (see Figure 1). These explanations are very accurate and reveal a pattern that the more occurrences of the discriminative feature for the corresponding class (i.e., red cycle, green cycle, and cycle with heterogeneous edge color, respectively) substantially boost the confidence of the GNN during the decision-making process. Motif. The quantitative result in Table 2 shows that the explanations for all classes successfully identify the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect. In Figure 1, the explanation graphs for House and Complete-5 class match the exact motif. Even though the explanation graphs for House-X and Complete-4 do not match the exact motif, it still obtains the class probabilities of 1. By analyzing the commonality between the explanations and their corresponding ground truth motifs for House-X and Complete-4 respectively, we speculate the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect for these two classes is the following: in House-X graphs, the orange node and the red node should have 3 neighbors except the purple node, the green node and the blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color; in Complete-4 graphs, every node should have 3 neighbors in different color. Clearly, the GNN with a test accuracy of 0.9964 ( Table 1) perceives the wrong motifs as the House-X and Complete-4, which can potentially incur misclassification for unseen graphs with misleading patterns. Shape. In Table 2, the explanations for all the classes except Lollipop achieve a good quantitative performance. For Lollipop, the average class probability of 0.742 is still a reasonably high probability than 0.2 (the baseline probability of random guess for a classification task with 5 classes). Besides, the explanation graphs for all 4 classes presented in Figure 1 are almost consistent with the desired graph patterns. Nonetheless, it also discloses some interesting findings regarding the high-level decision-making process of the GNN. For Wheel and Grid class, the explanation graphs are not very perfect but with the predicted class probability of 1. Accordingly, we infer the true belief inside the GNN is that: the discriminative features of Wheel graph and Grid graph are a single common vertex shared by multiple triangles and multiple polygons sharing some common edges, respectively. These might become the potential model pitfalls because, for example, the GNN will be easily tricked by a non-wheel graph in which there exists a common vertex shared by multiple triangles. Verification Study. Since the ground truth model-level explanation graphs are unknown, the correctness of our analysis regarding these potential GNN pitfalls cannot be directly justified. Therefore, to verify the correctness, we conduct controlled experimental studies to test how the GNN behaves on some carefully chosen input graphs with specific misleading patterns. As mentioned above, we speculate the discriminative feature the GNN tries to detect for the House-X class is that \"orange node and red node should have 3 neighbors except purple node, green node and blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color\". We found 9 plausible motifs (including the ground truth House-X) which satisfy this rule (see Figure 2). Given a fixed set of 5000 base graphs, each of the 9 different motifs are attached to the same node of each base graphs respectively. Thus, we obtain 9 sets of graphs, each of which contains 5000 graphs corresponding to one of the motifs. For each motif set, the classification results are presented in Table 3. We can see that motif 1-8 successfully fool the explained GNN because a large portion of the non-House-X graphs are incorrectly classified as House-X. This verification result strongly supports our qualitative analysis regarding the potential model pitfall for House-X class. The verification studies for more classes are presented in Appendix D. Ablation Study. In many cases, especially when true graphs are constrained with certain domainspecific rules, the second term of the objective function in Equation 2 plays a significant role in generating meaningful explanations. To assess the effectiveness of the second term, we take the Mutagen class from MUTAG dataset as an example to conduct an ablation study on this term. As shown in Figure 3, the explanation without the second term completely deviates from the true data distribution because the ground truth discriminative feature of the mutagen class (i.e., NO2) is completely missing in the explanation without the second term. Even though the explanation without second term achieve a significantly higher logits, it is difficult to gain the meaningful insights from the explanation without second term. That is to say, the out-of-distribution explanation graph generated without the second term might not provide meaningful insight on how the model actually reasons over the true data distribution, which is what we actually care about. 6 CONCLUSION: We propose GNNInterpreter, a probabilistic generative model-level explanation method for GNNs, which learns a graph distribution to depict the representative pattern perceived by the GNNs regarding the target class. By optimizing the objective function we specifically designed, GNNInterpreter can generate both faithful and valid explanation without relying on manually specified domain-specific graph rules. Compared with XGNN, GNNInterpreter is more general and computationally efficient because it can generate explanations with different types of edge features and node features, about 10 times faster. This makes GNNInterpreter more practical and accessible in real-world applications. More importantly, the experimental results show that GNNInterpreter can not only produce more faithful results than XGNN on real-life dataset, but also reveal the potential model pitfalls such as the bias attribution issue and misclassification of unseen graphs with misleading graph pattern.

L1 and L2 Regularization. L1 and L2 regularizations are widely used to encourage model sparsity and reduce the parameter size. In our case, both regularizations are applied on \u2126 during the optimization to reduce its size, with the purpose of mitigating the saturating gradient problem caused by the sigmoid function in Equation 7. For k \u2208 {1, 2}, Lk penalty term is defined as RLk = \u2225\u2126\u2225k. (9) Budget Penalty. Budget penalty is employed in instance-level GNN explanation methods (i.e., PGExplainer (Luo et al., 2020) and GNNExplainer (Ying et al., 2019)) to generate compact and meaningful explanations. For the model-level explanation, budget penalty can prevent the size of explanation graphs from growing unboundedly with repeated discriminative patterns. Budget penalty is defined as Rb = softplus (\u2225sigmoid(\u2126)\u22251 \u2212B)2 , (10) where B is the expected maximum number of edges in the explanation graph. Unlike PGExplainer, we utilize softplus instead of ReLU to slack the rate of gradient change near the boundary condition. In addition, the penalty is squared to further discourage extremely large graphs. Connectivity Constraint. Inspired by PGExplainer, we apply a connectivity constraint to encourage explanation graphs to be connected, by minimizing the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between the probabilities of each pair of edges that share a common node in the Gilbert random graph, Rc = \u2211 i\u2208V \u2211 j,k\u2208N (i) DKL(Pij\u2225Pik) (11) where Pij denotes the Bernoulli distribution parameterized by sigmoid(\u03c9ij). As opposed to PGExplainer, KL-divergence is chosen over cross-entropy in order to decouple the entropy of individual edge distributions from the connectivity constraint. B TRAINING PROCEDURE OF GNNINTERPRETER: Algorithm 1: Generate Explanation Graphs Using GNNInterpreter 1 Calculate the average graph embedding \u03c8\u0304c from the training data of GNN model. 2 Initialize latent parameters \u2126, H, and \u039e. 3 while not converged do 4 for k \u2190 1...K do 5 Using the reparameterization trick, sample A\u0303, E\u0303, X\u0303 with Equation 7. 6 Obtain the class score s(k)c \u2190 \u03d5c(A\u0303, E\u0303, X\u0303). 7 Obtain the graph embedding h(k)c \u2190 \u03c8c(A\u0303, E\u0303, X\u0303). 8 end 9 Calculate L\u2190 1 K \u2211K k=1 [ s (k) c + \u00b5simcos(h (k) c , \u03c8\u0304c) ] with the regularization terms. 10 Calculate\u2207\u2126L,\u2207HL, and\u2207\u039eL, then update \u2126, H, and \u039e using gradient ascent. 11 end 12 Let \u0398 = sigmoid(\u2126), P = Softmax(\u039e), Q = Softmax(H). 13 return G = (A,E,X), where A,E,X are sampled with Equation 4 parameterized by \u0398,P,Q. C THE EVALUATION RESULTS OF IS_ACYCLIC FROM XGNN PAPER: In order to conduct more comprehensive comparison with the current state-of-the-art method (XGNN), we managed to evaluate GNNInterpreter on Is_Acyclic data which is synthetically generated by the XGNN authors and posted at XGNN GitHub1. We trained a GCN classifier on this dataset with an accuracy of 1 (see the last row of Table 4) and adopted GNNInterpreter to explain the two classes in Is_Acyclic. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of GNNInterpreter on Is_Acyclic is conducted in a similar manner of other datasets, which is shown in Table 5 and Figure 4, respectively. However, it is unfortunate that XGNN could not provide any meaningful explanation for the GCN model we trained on Is_Acyclic (like what we experienced for the Shape and Motif dataset). We spent an extensive amount of time tuning the hyper-parameter of XGNN, but we still could not obtain meaningful and acceptable explanation graphs. We also attempted to conduct a comparative study on the GNN model trained by the XGNN authors because its model checkpoint is available in the google drive folder they shared. But unfortunately, the model definition of the GNN model on Is_Acyclic is not available on their GitHub (only the model definition of GNN for MUTAG is provided on their GitHub) so we cannot successfully load the model checkpoint they trained for Is_Acyclic. Even so, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of XGNN on the GCN model we trained on Is_Acyclic is still presented in Table 5 and Figure 4. Speaking of the evaluation results, the quantitative result in Table 5 shows that, for both classes, we can consistently generate faithful explanations containing the discriminative pattern of the target class perceived by the GNN. However, the XGNN explanations for both classes is less ideal because the average class probability over 1000 explanation graphs for Cyclic class is almost zero. This indicates that the explanation graphs generated for both classes will be classified as Acyclic by the GNN, no matter which is the target class to explain. In terms of the computational time, we can generate an explanation graph about 2 times faster than XGNN on average. Qualitatively speaking, our explanation graphs for both Cyclic and Acyclic class are consistent with the class definition with 1https://github.com/divelab/DIG/tree/main/dig/xgraph/XGNN the expected properties (see Figure 4). Namely, the explanation graph for Cyclic contains cycles while the explanation graph for Acyclic does not contain any cycles. In contrast, for both classes, XGNN fails to generate an explanation graph beyond two nodes, even after our extensive trail-and-error effort. D A VERIFICATION STUDY OF OUR ANALYSIS ABOUT QUALITATIVE RESULTS: From Figure 1, we can see that the explanation graphs for some classes are different from the true graphs in the training data, which might indicate the potential pitfall of the explained GNN. However, since the ground truth model-level explanation graph does not exist, it is difficult to verify the correctness of our analysis regarding these potential pitfalls. In this section, we conducted the controlled experimental studies for MUTAG, House-X in Motif and Complete-4 in Motif, to verify our high-level interpretation of the explained GNN mentioned in the subsection 5.2. D.1 MOTIF Complete-4 In subsection 5.2, we infer that the discriminative feature the GNN tries to detect is that \"every node should have 3 neighbors in different color\". This rule is concluded from our observation of the commonality between our explanation graph and the ground truth motif. We found 8 different motifs (including the ground truth Complete-4) which satisfy this rule, as shown in Figure 5. Given a fixed set of 5000 Rome graphs, these 8 different motifs are attached to the same node of those 5000 Rome graphs. As a result, we obtain 8 sets of graphs, and each set includes 5000 graphs corresponding to a single motif. For each motif set, the average predicted class probability of each class and the total number of graphs which are classified as each class are presented in the Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. We can clearly see that motif 1-6 successfully fool the explained GNN because their predicted class probability of Complete-4 is significantly higher than their predicted class probability of Others. This results indicate that our previous analysis in subsection 5.2 regarding how the GNN makes prediction for Complete-4 is correct. Namely, the GNN trained with the Motif dataset is highly likely to incorrectly classify the graphs containing a misleading pattern identified by the GNNInterpreter, even though the GNN accuracy is as high as 0.9964 (see Table 1). Therefore, GNNInterpreter can be served as a sanity check for GNNs, especially the one with high accuracy, and remind people to be cautious when applying GNNs to classify some unseen graphs containing the misleading patterns identified by the GNNInterpreter. House-X In subsection 5.2, we speculate the discriminative feature perceived by the explained GNN is that \"orange node and red node should have 3 neighbors except purple node, green node and blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color\". This discriminative feature is also deduced from the commonality between our explanation for House-X and the ground truth motif. The 9 motifs satisfying this rule are shown in Figure 6. The controlled experimental study for House-X class is conducted in a similar manner as for Complete-4 class. The quantitative results for each motif set in Table 8 and Table 9 shows that all the plausible motifs satisfying the rule are highly likely to be classified as House-X, no matter what are their corresponding ground truth labels. Specifically, a large number of graphs from motif set 1-8 are misclassified to the House-X class, especially the motif 1 and motif 6. It also indicates that the GNN are easily fooled by the graphs containing the plausible motifs satisfying the rule that \"orange node and red node should have 3 neighbors except purple node, green node and blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color\". In summary, speaking of the GNN trained on the Motif dataset with the accuracy of 0.9964, this verification study shows that our explanation results is faithful because it successfully reveals the true model pitfalls. According to the explanation graphs provided in Figure 1, the discriminative feature captured by our explanation graph for the mutagen class is the occurrences of the NO2 group. However, there are no special pattern observed from our explanation graph for the non-mutagen class. To verify whether the occurrences of NO2 group is truly the discriminative feature GNN tries to detect when making prediction for the mutagen class, we designed a controlled experiment such that each set of graphs contains different numbers of NO2 group while keeping other experimental settings the same. To be specific, given 1000 randomly generated Gabriel graphs with 5-10 nodes, each time we attach 15 nodes to these random graphs. These 15 nodes will be divided into 5 groups, and each group has 3 nodes. The frequency of NO2 group appearing in these 15 nodes varies from 0 to 5. For instance, in Figure 7, the example graph for 5 NO2 contains a Gabriel graph with 6 nodes and 5 NO2 groups; the example graph for 4 NO2 contains the same Gabriel graph, 4 NO2 groups, and a random group of 3 nodes. As a result, we will obtain 6 sets of graphs and each set includes 1000 graphs containing a fixed number of NO2 group. Then, we feed these 6000 graphs into the GNN trained with the MUTAG dataset to obtain the quantitative results. Similar to what we did for Motif dataset, for each 1000 graphs with a fixed number of NO2 group, the average predicted class probability for each class and the number of graphs being classified as each class is presented in Table 10 and Table 11. We can clearly see that as more and more NO2 group occurs, the GNN become more and more certain about classifying these graphs as the mutagen class. That is to say, the number of occurrences of NO2 groups indeed are the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect when making prediction for the mutagen class, which is consistent with our previous finding when analyzing our explanations for both classes in subsection 5.2. Thus, this verification study proves that our explanations for MUTAG dataset are faithful and informative because it can correctly interpret the high-level decision-making procress of the GNN. It has been shown that GNNs trained on binary classification task can suffer from the bias attribution issue (Faber et al., 2021). Essentially, the GNN with bias attribution issue will classify any graphs as class A unless it finds sufficient evidence of class B. From Table 10 and Table 11, it is interesting to observe that the GNN seems bias toward the non-mutagen class unless the GNN finds enough evidence (i.e., NO2 group) for the mutagen class. This indicates that this GNN is suffering from the bias attribution issue so that no special pattern is observed from our explanation graph for nonmutagen class in Figure 1. Therefore, this verification study also proves that the faithful explanation generated by GNNInterpreter can help us to diagnose whether the GNN is suffering from the bias attribution issue. E MULTIPLE EXPLANATION GRAPHS PER CLASS PER DATASET: For each dataset, multiple qualitative examples per class are shown in Figure 8. F EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: All the experiments are conducted on a single core of an Intel Core i9 CPU. Speaking of the software, all the models are implemented in Python 3.9. We use PyTorch 1.10 for auto-differentiation and numerical optimization. Besides, all the GNNs are implemented with PyTorch Geometric 2.0. We also use PyTorch-Scatter library to handle vector gather-scatter operations. Lastly, we utilize NetworkX for graph data generation and processing. G SYNTHETIC DATASET GENERATION: In the experimental study, we evaluate the efficacy of GNNInterpreter on 4 synthetic datasets: Cyclicity, Shape, Motif, and Is_Acyclic. Among them, Cyclicity and Motif are synthetically generated on top of Rome Dataset2 which has 11534 undirected graphs with 10-100 nodes. The generation procedures for the first 3 synthetic datasets are specified in algorithm 2, algorithm 3, and algorithm 4, respectively. Lastly, Is_Acyclic dataset is a dataset synthetically generated by the XGNN authors (Yuan et al., 2020a). H EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS OF GNN CLASSIFIERS: In the experimental study, we adopt GNNInterpreter to explain 5 GNN classifiers which are trained on 5 different datasets. In this section, we will describe some experimental details about the GNN models for all 5 datasets. These experimental details include the model architecture, hyper-parameter settings, and test F1 scores per class obtained by the GNN models. 2http://www.graphdrawing.org/data.html Algorithm 2: Cyclicity dataset generation procedure Edge Classes: {RED, GREEN} Graph Classes: {RED-CYCLIC, GREEN-CYCLIC, ACYCLIC} Input: Rome Dataset Output: A collection of pairs consisted of a graph and its label 1 for G in Rome Dataset do 2 Randomly label each edge in G as RED or GREEN. 3 if G is acyclic then 4 yield (G, ACYCLIC) 5 break 6 end 7 while more than one cycle exists in G do 8 Remove a random edge from a random cycle in G. 9 end 10 Randomly pick a color Ccycle \u2208 {RED, GREEN}. 11 Relable all edges in the remaining cycle in G as Ccycle. 12 Randomly pick a color Cedge \u2208 {RED, GREEN}. 13 Relable a random edge in the remaining cycle in G as Cedge. 14 if Ccycle = Cedge = RED then 15 yield (G, RED-CYCLIC) 16 else if Ccycle = Cedge = GREEN then 17 yield (G, GREEN-CYCLIC) 18 else 19 yield (G, ACYCLIC) 20 end 21 end Algorithm 3: Motif dataset generation procedure Node Classes: {RED, GREEN, ORANGE, BLUE, MAGENTA} Graph Classes: {HOUSE, HOUSE-X, COMPLETE-4, COMPLETE-5, OTHERS} Input: Rome Dataset Output: A collection of pairs consisted of a graph and its label 1 Let {GHOUSE, GHOUSE-X, GCOMPLETE-4, GCOMPLETE-5} be 4 motifs for the corresponding classes. 2 Define \u2295 as a graph operator such that G1 \u2295 G2 generates a union graph G1 \u222aG2 with an additional edge between a random node in G1 and a random node in G2. 3 for G in Rome Dataset do 4 Randomly select a label L \u2208 {OTHERS, HOUSE, HOUSE-X, COMPLETE-4, COMPLETE-5}. 5 if L = OTHERS then 6 Let GOTHERS be a random motif in {GHOUSE, GHOUSE-X, GCOMPLETE-4, GCOMPLETE-5} but with a random edge being removed. 7 end 8 yield (G \u2295 GL, L) 9 end H.1 MUTAG The GNN classifier we implemented for MUTAG dataset is a deep GCN model that contains 3 GCN layers of width 64, a global mean pooling layer, and 2 dense layers in the end. The model uses LeakyReLU as activation. Before training, the model parameters are initialized with Kaiming initializer. During training, AdamW optimizer is used for optimization with learning rate of 0.01 and weight decay of 0.01. The F1 scores for two classes in Table 12 shows that the GNN is more accurate when making decisions on Mutagen class. H.2 CYCLICITY The GNN classifier for Cyclicity dataset is a deep NNConv model that contains 5 NNConv layers of width 32 with a single-layered edge network, a global mean pooling layer, and 2 dense layers in the end. Before training, the model parameters are initialized with Kaiming initializer. During training, AdamW optimizer is used for optimization with learning rate of 0.01, learning rate decay of 0.01, and Algorithm 4: Shape dataset generation procedure Graph Classes: {LOLLIPOP, WHEEL, GRID, STAR, OTHERS} Output: A collection of pairs consisted of a graph and its label 1 for 8000 times do 2 Randomly select a label L \u2208 {OTHERS, LOLLIPOP, WHEEL, GRID, STAR}. 3 switch L do 4 case LOLLIPOP do 5 Sample lollipop graph GLOLLIPOP with random number of head nodes n \u2208 {4, ..., 16} and random number of tail nodes m \u2208 {4, ..., 16}. 6 case WHEEL do 7 Sample wheel graph GWHEEL with random number of non-center nodes n \u2208 {4, ..., 64}. 8 case GRID do 9 Sample grid graph GGRID with random width w \u2208 {2, ..., 8} and random height h \u2208 {2, ..., 8}. 10 case STAR do 11 Sample star graph GSTAR with random number of non-center nodes n \u2208 {4, ..., 64}. 12 case OTHERS do 13 Sample Binomial random graph GOTHERS with random number of nodes n \u2208 {8, ..., 32} and random edge probability p \u2208 [0.2, 1]. 14 end 15 Add random number of noisy edges to GL with a random ratio p \u2208 [0, 0.2]. 16 yield (GL, L) 17 end weight decay of 0.01. As shown in Table 12, all three classes have similar F1 scores, which means that the GNN model have a balanced performance on each class. H.3 MOTIF The Motif dataset uses exactly the same model architecture and hyper-parameter settings as MUTAG dataset. The F1 score per class presented in Table 12 indicates that the GNN achieves a perfect performance on Complete-5 class and a near-perfect performance on every other classes. H.4 SHAPE The Shape dataset uses the same model architecture and hyper-parameter settings as MUTAG dataset except that the model contains 4 GCN layers instead of 3 GCN layers. Also, the F1 score per class in Table 12 shows that the GNN can perfectly predict the Star class, whereas the predictions for the Lollipop class and the Grid class are less accurate. H.5 IS_ACYCLIC The Is_Acyclic dataset uses the same model architecture and hyper-parameter settings as Shape dataset except that max pooling is used instead of mean pooling for the global pooling layer, due to the nature of the task that the class prediction can be very sensitive to local patterns. The model is able to predict both classes perfectly with an F1 score of 1.0. I EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS OF GNNINTERPRETER: For all experiments, we choose to set the Concrete Distribution temperature \u03c4 = 0.2. We use the sample size K = 10 for all Monte Carlo samplings. For optimization, we adopt SGD optimizer with the learning rate of 1 and terminate the learning procedure until convergence. Additionally, in the training objective, the embedding similarity weight \u00b5 is set to 1 for every dataset except MUTAG. For MUTAG dataset, we let \u00b5 = 10 due to its nature that the structure of the graphs in the dataset needs to follow certain domain-specific rules. A higher value of \u00b5 allows the GNNInterpreter to implicitly capture these rules from the average graph embeddings. Speaking of the regularization weight, we employ grid search to obtain the best results under different combinations of regularization terms. To ensure the reproducibility of our experimental results, we also report the exact regularization weights used for all the quantitative and qualitative evaluations from the manuscript in Table 13. Note that we adopt a constant weight strategy for L1 regularization RL1 , L2 regularization RL2 , and connectivity constraint Rc throughout the training process. In contrast, for budget penalty Rb, we employ a 500-iteration initial warm up period to gradually increase the weight starting from 0.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: GNNInterpreter: A Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation for Graph Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Graphs are widely used to model data in many applications such as chemistry, social science, transportation, etc. Since a graph is an unique non-Euclidean data structure, modeling graph data remained a challenging task until Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerged (Defferrard et al., 2016; Hamilton et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018). As a powerful tool for representation learning on graph data, GNN achieved state-of-the-art performance on various different machine learning tasks on graphs. As the popularity of GNNs rapidly increases, people begin to wonder why one should trust this model and how the model makes decisions. However, the complexity of GNNs prevents humans from interpreting the underlying mechanism in the model. The lack of self-explainability becomes a serious obstacle for applying GNNs to real-world problems, especially those when making wrong decisions may incur an unaffordable cost. Explaining deep learning models on text or image data (Simonyan et al., 2014; Selvaraju et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Binder et al., 2016) has been well-studied. However, the explainability of deep learning models on graphs is still less explored. Compared with explaining deep learning models on text or image data, explaining deep graph models is a more challenging task for several reasons (Yuan et al., 2020b): (i) the adjacency matrix representing the topological information has only discrete values, which cannot be directly optimized via gradient-based methods (Duval & Malliaros, 2021), (ii) in some application domains, a graph is valid only if it satisfies a set of domain-specific graph rules, so that generating a valid explanation graph to depicts the underlying decision-making process of GNNs is an nontrivial task, and (iii) graph data structure is heterogeneous in nature with different types of node features and edge features, which makes developing a one-size-fits-all explanation method for GNNs to be even more challenging. In recent years, explaining GNNs has aroused great interest and thus many research works have been conducted. The existing works can be classified into two categories: instance-level explanations (Luo et al., 2020; Ying et al., 2019; Vu & Thai, 2020) and model-level explanations (Yuan et al., 2020a). Instance-level explanation methods attempt to interpret the model prediction for a given graph instance, whereas model-level explanation methods aim at understanding the general behavior of the model not specific to any particular graph instance. However, if the ultimate goal is to examine the model reliability, instance-level methods are very time-consuming because one will need to examine many instances one by one to draw a rigorous conclusion about the model reliability. Conversely, the model-level explanation method can directly explain the high-level decision-making rule inside the blackbox (GNN) for a target prediction, which is much less time-consuming and more informative about the general decision-making process of the model. Besides, it has been shown that any instancelevel explanation method would fail to provide faithful explanation for a GNN that suffers from the bias attribution issue (Faber et al., 2021), while model-level explanation method can not only provide faithful explanation for this case but also diagnose the bias attribution issue. Even though the model-level explanation methods for GNNs have such advantages, they are much less explored than the instance-level explanation methods . In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model-level explanation method for GNNs, GNNInterpreter, which learns a generative explanation graph distribution that represents the most discriminative features the GNN tries to detect when making a certain prediction. Precisely, the explanation graph distribution are learned by optimizing a novel objective function specifically designed for model-level explanation of GNNs such that the generated explanation is both faithful and valid regarding the domain-specific knowledge. More importantly, GNNInterpreter is a general approach to generating explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features for explaining different GNNs which follows the message passing scheme. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of GNNInterpreter on four different datasets including synthetic datasets and public real-world dataset. The experimental results show that GNNInterpreter can precisely find the ideal topological structure for the target prediction if the explained model is ideal, and reveal the potential pitfalls in the model decision-making process if there is any. By identifying these potential model pitfalls, people can be mindful when applying this model to unseen graphs with a specific misleading pattern, which is especially important for some field in which making wrong decisions may incur an unaffordable cost. Compared with the current state-of-the-art model-level explanation method for GNNs, for example XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a), the quantitative and qualitative evaluation result shows that the explanation graphs generated by GNNInterpreter is more representative regarding the target class than the explanations generated by XGNN. Additionally, GNNInterpreter has the following advantages compared with XGNN: \u2022 GNNInterpreter is a more general approach that can generate explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features, whereas XGNN cannot generate graphs with continuous node features or any type of edge features. \u2022 By taking advantage of the special design of our objective function, GNNInterpreter is more flexible in explaining different GNN models without the need of having domain-specific knowledge for the specific task, whereas XGNN requires domain-specific knowledge to manually design the reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. \u2022 GNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient. For example, GNNInterpreter only takes less than a minute to explain one class in a GNN model, which is about 10 times faster than training a deep reinforcement learning agent as in XGNN. \u2022 GNNInterpreter is a numerical optimization approach without introducing another blackbox to explain GNNs, unlike XGNN which trains a deep learning model to explain GNNs. 2 RELATED WORK: Graph Neural Network. Unlike images and texts, modeling graph data is very challenging due to the unique characteristics of graphs. Tons of research has been conducted to extend the previously existing deep learning algorithms to graph data, which gives rise to the emergence of GNNs. GNNs have achieved remarkable success in different machine learning tasks including graph classification (Lee et al., 2018), node classification (Xu et al., 2019), and link prediction (Zhang & Chen, 2018). There exists a variety of GNN models (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018), but they often share a common idea of message passing as described in section 3 with different time complexity (Wu et al., 2020). Instance-Level Explanation of GNN. Encouraged by the success of explaining deep neural networks on image or text data, the first instance-level explanation method of GNNs (Pope et al., 2019) emerged in 2019. Since then, a multitude of instance-level explanation methods of GNNs has been proposed in the past few years. According to a recent survey (Yuan et al., 2020b), these instance-level explanation methods can be classified into four categories: gradient-based methods (Baldassarre & Azizpour, 2019), perturbation-based methods (Ying et al., 2019), decomposition methods (Schwarzenberg et al., 2019), and surrogate methods (Vu & Thai, 2020; Huang et al., 2020). These four categories all attempt to explain how a GNN model makes such a prediction for a specific input instance. However, if the ultimate goal is to validate whether this model is trustworthy, it is very time-consuming to manually check the instance-level explanation for many graph instances one by one before we can make any rigorous conclusion about the model reliability. Besides, all of them will fail to provide faithful explanation for a GNN model suffering from the bias attribution issue because the ground truth explanation edges for one of classes in this case will be an empty set (Faber et al., 2021). Model-Level Explanation Method of GNN. Unlike instance-level explanation methods, model-level explanation methods aim to explain the general behavior of a model without respect to any specific input. The current state-of-the-art model-level explanation method for GNNs is called XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a). Similar to the most of model-level explanation methods for other deep learning model (Simonyan et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015), XGNN and GNNInterpreter share a common goal of generating explanation graphs to maximize the likelihood of the target prediction being made by the GNN model. However, XGNN adopts a completely different approach. To be more concrete, given a target class c, XGNN trains a deep graph generator fc, which generates graphs by adding one edge at a step, in a reinforcement learning setting. After training is done, fc is able to construct input graphs that attempts to maximize the score of class c in a pre-defined number of steps. Besides, it incorporates hand-crafted graph rules into the reward function so that fc can consider these rules when providing explanations. However, specifying these graph rules requires domain-specific knowledge about the task. XGNN also has a limitation that it can only generate explanation graphs with a single categorical node feature or no node feature. In other words, it cannot generate explanation graphs with any types of edge features or continuous node features. Unlike XGNN, GNNInterpreter is a much more general approach that can generate explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, GNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient, because for each class to be explained, XGNN trains a reinforcement learning model, while GNNInterpreter directly optimizes a generative distribution. 3 BACKGROUND: Notations. A graph is represented as G = (V,E), where V and E are the sets of nodes and edges. Besides, the number of edges and nodes are denoted as M and N respectively. The topological information of a graph is described by an adjacency matrix A \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7N where aij = 1 if there exists an edge between node i and node j, and aij = 0 otherwise. In addition, the node feature matrix X \u2208 RN\u00d7kV and edge feature matrix Z \u2208 RM\u00d7kE represent the features for N nodes and M edges. Graph Neural Networks. In general, the high-level idea of GNN is message passing. For each layer, it aggregates information from neighboring nodes to learn the representation of each node. For hidden layer i, the message passing operation can be written as{ H0 = X, Hi = f(Hi\u22121,A,Z), (1) where Hi \u2208 RN\u00d7F i is the hidden node representation output from ith layer and F i is the output feature dimension. The propagation rule f can be decomposed into three components: computing the messages according to the node embedding at the previous layer Hi\u22121, aggregating the messages from neighboring nodes, and updating the hidden representation Hi for each node based upon the aggregated message. It is worth mentioning that GNNInterpreter can explain different GNNs that follow this message passing scheme. 4 GNNINTERPRETER: In this paper, we propose a model-level explanation method, GNNInterpreter, which is capable of disclosing the high-level decision-making process of the model for the purpose of examining model reliability. GNNInterpreter is a numerical optimization approach that is model-agnostic for explaining different GNNs as long as it follows the message passing scheme. Besides, it can generate explanation graphs with different types of edge features and node features. Specifically, we design a novel objective function for generating model-level explanation for GNNs, so that optimizing this objective function will result in both faithful and valid explanation graphs. That is to say, the generated explanation not only captures the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect when making a certain prediction, but also is a valid graph satisfying the domain-specific graph rules. Due to the discreteness nature of graph data, we learn a generative explanation graph distribution by adopting the Gumbel-Softmax trick (Maddison et al., 2016). 4.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE: To reveal the high-level decision-making process of the model, one effective approach is to construct a explanation graph that can trigger a specific response from the model as much as possible. Similar to most of the model-level explanation methods for other deep learning models (Simonyan et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015), the explanation for GNNs can be obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the explanation graph G being predicted as a target class by the GNN model. However, solely maximizing the likelihood without constraints may not necessarily result in meaningful explanations. This is because a local maxima in the objective landscape may lie outside of the training data distribution. The explanation yielded from this type of maxima are mathematically legitimate but may provide no meaningful insights on how the model actually reasons over the true data distribution. Especially when there exists domain-specific knowledge that restricts the validity of the data, the explanations are expected to stay inside the hard boundary of the true data distribution. XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a) addresses this problem by manually specifying a set of graph rules and evaluating the validity of explanation graphs according to the specified rules as a part of the reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. The essential goal is to confine the distribution of the explanation graphs to the domain-specific boundary. Nevertheless, manually specifying rules not only is tedious and time-consuming, but also requires domain expertise which is not always available. Moreover, in many cases, the rules over data distribution can not even be programmatically specified. Therefore, we propose to leverage the abstract knowledge learned by the GNN itself to prevent the explanation from deviating from the true data distribution. This can be achieved by maximizing the similarity between the explanation graph embedding and the average embedding of all graphs from the target class in the training set. Thus, we mathematically formulate our learning objective as follows, max G L(G) = max A,Z,X L(A,Z,X) = max A,Z,X \u03d5c(A,Z,X) + \u00b5simcos(\u03c8(A,Z,X), \u03c8\u0304c) (2) where L is the objective function; \u03d5c is the scoring function before Softmax corresponding to the class of interest c, predicted by the explained GNN; \u03c8 is the graph embedding function of the explained GNN; \u03c8\u0304c is the average graph embedding for all graphs belonging to class c in the training set; simcos denotes the cosine similarity; and \u00b5 is a hyper-parameter representing the weight factor. Given the learning objective defined above, one possible approach to obtain the explanation graph is that we can adopt the gradient ascent to iteratively update the explanation graphG toward maximizing the learning objective. However, this approach cannot be directly applied here because the discrete adjacency matrix A encoding the graph topology is non-differentiable, namely \u2207AL(A,Z,X) does not exist. Therefore, in order to adopt the gradient ascent method, A needs to be relaxed to a continuous variable. In addition, if the training graphs of the GNN model have discrete edge features or discrete node features, then Z and X are also required to be relaxed to the continuous domain such that \u2207ZL(A,Z,X) and \u2207XL(A,Z,X) exist. Given that the continuous edge features and continuous node features do not require any special accommodation to adopt the gradient ascent, we will only discuss how to learn a continuously relaxed explanation graph with discrete edge features and discrete node features in the following sections. 4.2 LEARNING GENERATIVE GRAPH DISTRIBUTION: To learn a probabilistic generative graph distribution such that the graph drawn from this distribution can maximize the learning objective, two assumptions have been made about the explanation graph. The first assumption is that the graph is a Gilbert random graph (Gilbert, 1959) in which every possible edge occurs independently with probability 0 < p < 1. The second assumption is that the features for each node and edge are independently distributed. Given these two assumptions, the probability distribution of the graph G, a random graph variable, can be factorized as P (G) = \u220f i\u2208V P (xi) \u00b7 \u220f (i,j)\u2208E P (zij)P (aij) (3) where aij = 1 when there exists an edge between node i and j and aij = 0 otherwise, zij denotes the edge feature between node i and j, and xi represents the node feature of node i. Intuitively, aij can be modeled as a Bernoulli distribution in which the probability of success \u03b8ij represents the probability of an edge existing between node i and j in G. For the discrete edge feature zij and the discrete node feature xi, we can assume that zij and xi follow a Categorical distribution, a generalized Bernoulli distribution, with the parameter specifying the probability of each possible outcome for the categorical node feature and the categorical edge feature. In summary, the probability distribution of aij , xi and zij can be written as aij \u223c Bernoulli(\u03b8ij), for aij \u2208 A and \u03b8ij \u2208 \u0398 zij \u223c Categorical(qij), for zij \u2208 Z and qij \u2208 Q xi \u223c Categorical(pi), for xi \u2208 X and pi \u2208 P (4) where \u2225qij\u22251 = 1 and \u2225pij\u22251 = 1. We define the number of edge categories kE = dim(qij) and the number of node categories kV = dim(pi). Thus, to learn the probabilistic distribution for explanation graphs, we can rewrite the learning objective as max G L(G) = max \u0398,Q,P EG\u223cP (G)[\u03d5c(A,Z,X) + \u00b5simcos(\u03c8(A,Z,X), \u03c8\u0304c)]. (5) 4.3 CONTINUOUS RELAXATION WITH REPARAMETERIZATION TRICK: To adopt gradient ascent over the learning objective function with respect to a graph with the discrete edge feature zij and the discrete node feature xi, we relax aij , zij and xi to continuous random variables a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i, respectively. Specifically, aij is relaxed to a\u0303ij \u2208 [0, 1]; zij is relaxed to z\u0303ij \u2208 [0, 1]kE , \u2225z\u0303ij\u22251 = 1; and xi is relaxed to x\u0303i \u2208 [0, 1]kV , \u2225x\u0303i\u22251 = 1. Given that the Concrete distribution (Maddison et al., 2016) is a family of continuous versions of Categorical random variables with closed form density, the distribution of continuously relaxed a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i can be written as a\u0303ij \u223c BinaryConcrete(\u03c9ij , \u03c4a), for a\u0303ij \u2208 A\u0303 and \u03c9ij \u2208 \u2126 z\u0303ij \u223c Concrete(\u03b7ij , \u03c4z), for z\u0303ij \u2208 Z\u0303 and \u03b7ij \u2208 H x\u0303i \u223c Concrete(\u03bei, \u03c4x), for x\u0303i \u2208 X\u0303 and \u03bei \u2208 \u039e (6) where \u03c4 \u2208 (0,\u221e) is the hyper-parameter representing the temperature, \u03c9ij = log(\u03b8ij/(1 \u2212 \u03b8ij), \u03b7ij = logqij , and \u03bei = logpi. As the temperature approaches zero, the Concrete distribution is mathematically equivalent to the Categorical distribution. However, in order to learn the generative explanation graph distribution, the sampling function for sampling a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i from the Concrete distribution is required to be differentiable. Thus, the reparametrization trick is adopted to approximate the sampling procedure of a\u0303ij , z\u0303ij and x\u0303i by a differentiable function. Given an independent random variable \u03f5 \u223c Uniform(0,1), the sampling function with the reparameterization trick is as follows, a\u0303ij = sigmoid ((\u03c9ij + log \u03f5\u2212 log(1\u2212 \u03f5)) /\u03c4a) z\u0303ij = Softmax ((\u03b7ij \u2212 log(\u2212 log \u03f5)) /\u03c4z) x\u0303i = Softmax ((\u03beij \u2212 log(\u2212 log \u03f5)) /\u03c4x) . (7) Given this reparameterization trick, we can draw a sample a\u0303ij as an approximation of aij , where the probability of a\u0303ij to be close to 1 is the same as the probability of aij to equal 1 and vice versa. Specifically, P (a\u0303ij \u2192 1) = 1 \u2212 P (a\u0303ij \u2192 0) = P (aij = 1) = \u03b8ij = sigmoid(\u03c9ij). Similarly, z\u0303ij and x\u0303i drawn from the Concrete distribution as in Equation 7 is an approximation of zij and xi. Therefore, the learning objective with continuous relaxation and reparameterization trick can be approximated by the Monte Carlo method with K samples, max \u0398,Q,P EG\u223cP (G)[L(A,Z,X)] \u2248 max \u2126,H,\u039e E\u03f5\u223cU(0,1)[L(A\u0303, Z\u0303, X\u0303)] \u2248 max \u2126,H,\u039e 1 K K\u2211 k=1 L(A\u0303, Z\u0303, X\u0303). (8) In order to facilitate optimization and ensure that the explanation graphs are constrained to desired properties, we apply multiple regularization terms to the latent parameters (see details in Appendix A). Also, the detailed algorithm of GNNInterpreter is illustrated in Appendix B. 4.4 THE GENERALIZABILITY OF GNNINTERPRETER: GNNInterpreter can generate explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features if needed. If the node feature or edge feature is continuous, \u2207XL(A,Z,X) and \u2207ZL(A,Z,X) naturally exist, then we only need to relax the adjacency matrix A to a continuous random variable as in Equation 6. Additionally, unlike XGNN which can only learn graphs with a single categorical node feature, the number of edge features and node features are not limited in GNNInterpreter. GNNInterpreter can explain different GNNs following the message passing scheme. In the original message passing scheme, messages are aggregated from their neighbors to update the current node embedding. To adapt the message passing scheme for GNNInterpreter, messages are passed from all the other nodes but each message is weighted by \u03b8ij = sigmoid(\u03c9ij). Therefore, if \u03b8ij approaches to 1, meaning that node i and node j are highly likely to be the neighbor, the message passed between them will be the same as in the original message passing scheme. With this small modification, GNNInterpreter can be easily applied to different GNNs following the message passing scheme. 5 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: To comprehensively assess the effectiveness of GNNInterpreter, we carefully design experimental studies conducted on 4 datasets to demonstrate our flexibility of generating explanation graphs with various feature types and manifests our capability of explaining different GNNs. Specifically, we train a GNN classifier for each dataset and adopt GNNInterpreter to explain. In addition, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare the efficacy of GNNInterpreter with XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a). Details about the experiments and synthetic datasets generation are presented in Appendix F,G,H, and I. 5.1 DATASETS: Synthetic Dataset. We synthetically generate 3 datasets which are Cyclicity, Motif, and Shape (see Table 1). (1) In Cyclicity, the graphs have an categorical edge feature with 2 possible values: green or red. There are 3 class labels in Cyclicity, which are Red-Cyclic graphs, Green-Cyclic graphs, and Acyclic graphs. Specifically, a graph will be labeled as a green/red cyclic graph only if it is cyclic and the edges forming that cycle are all green/red. If a graph is categorized as Acyclic, then it either does not contain a cycle at all or contains a cycle but with a mixture of green and red edges. (2) The graphs in Motif are labeled according to whether they contain a certain motif. There are 4 motifs (i.e., House, House-X, Complete-4, and Complete-5) will possibly appear in the graphs and each motif corresponds to one class label. There is another class that contains the graphs without any special motif. Besides, each node in the graphs has a categorical node feature with 5 possible values: red, orange, green, blue, and purple. (3) Shape contains 5 classes of graphs: Lollipop, Wheel, Grid, Star, and Others. In all the classes except the Others class, graphs are generated with the corresponding shape. For the Others class, graphs are randomly generated without any special topology. Real-world Dataset. MUTAG (Kersting et al., 2016) is a real-world dataset with 2 classes: Mutagen and Nonmutagen. Each molecule graph is categorized according to its mutagenic effect (Debnath et al., 1991). Given the fact that the molecules with more NO2 are more likely to mutate, the graphs in the Mutagen class tend to have more NO2 than those in the Nonmutagen class. Besides, the Mutagen class and the Nonmutagen class share a common feature which is rings of carbon atoms. 5.2 RESULTS: To investigate whether we can truly explain the high-level decision-making process, we evaluated GNNInterpreter both quantitatively and qualitatively. Following XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020a), the class probability of the explanation graphs predicted by the GNN is adopted as the quantitative metric since GNNInterpreter and XGNN share a common objective of maximizing the target class score (Table 2). Also, to qualitatively evaluate GNNInterpreter, we present one explanation graph per class for all datasets in Figure 1, which are all predicted as the target class with the class probability of 1. Due to the page limit, more explanation graphs per class per dataset are presented in Appendix E. Since XGNN is the current state-of-the-art model-level explanation method for GNNs, we compare GNNInterpreter with XGNN quantitatively and qualitatively. However, given that XGNN cannot generate explanation graphs with edge features, XGNN is not applicable to the Cyclicity dataset. For Motif and Shape, we attempted to adopt XGNN to explain the corresponding GNNs, but the explanation results were not acceptable even after our extensive efforts of trial-and-error on XGNN. Therefore, for a fair comparison, we only present the evaluation results of XGNN on the GNN trained on MUTAG, with the same hyper-parameter settings for MUTAG as they discussed in their paper. In addition to these 4 datasets, we also conducted experiments on the Is_Acyclic dataset synthesized by XGNN authors, but we failed to reproduce similar results claimed in the XGNN paper. The details of our comparative study on Is_Acyclic dataset against XGNN can be found in Appendix C. MUTAG. The quantitative evaluation in Table 2 shows that all explanation graphs generated by GNNInterpreter are classified correctly with 100% probability for both classes with zero variance, which indicates that we can consistently generate the most representative explanation graphs in terms of the explained GNN for all three classes. On the contrary, the GNN is more hesitant or diffident when classifying the XGNN explanation graphs for both classes. Speaking of the time efficiency, for explaining the same GNN model trained on MUTAG, we can generate an explanation graph about 10 times faster than XGNN on average (see Table 2). In Figure 1, the GNNInterpreter explanation for Mutagen class contains 5 repeated NO2 whereas the GNNInterpreter explanation for Nonmutagen class does not contain O atom at all, which are perfectly aligned with our background knowledge about the MUTAG dataset mentioned in subsection 5.1. In contrast, the XGNN explanation for Mutagen class only contains a single NO2, which is a less accurate or ideal explanation than ours. In addition, according to our explanation graphs for both classes, they indicate that the GNN trained with MUTAG is likely to suffer from the bias attribution issue (Faber et al., 2021) because the explanation graph for Nonmutagen class does not contain any special pattern but achieve the class probability of 1. This finding is further verified by the additional experiments we conducted (see subsection D.2). Cyclicity. In addition to the good quantitative performance shown in Table 2, the explanation graphs for Red Cyclic and Green Cyclic only contain multiple red cycles and multiple green cycles, respectively; the explanation graph for Acyclic does not contain any cycle with homogeneous edge colors (see Figure 1). These explanations are very accurate and reveal a pattern that the more occurrences of the discriminative feature for the corresponding class (i.e., red cycle, green cycle, and cycle with heterogeneous edge color, respectively) substantially boost the confidence of the GNN during the decision-making process. Motif. The quantitative result in Table 2 shows that the explanations for all classes successfully identify the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect. In Figure 1, the explanation graphs for House and Complete-5 class match the exact motif. Even though the explanation graphs for House-X and Complete-4 do not match the exact motif, it still obtains the class probabilities of 1. By analyzing the commonality between the explanations and their corresponding ground truth motifs for House-X and Complete-4 respectively, we speculate the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect for these two classes is the following: in House-X graphs, the orange node and the red node should have 3 neighbors except the purple node, the green node and the blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color; in Complete-4 graphs, every node should have 3 neighbors in different color. Clearly, the GNN with a test accuracy of 0.9964 ( Table 1) perceives the wrong motifs as the House-X and Complete-4, which can potentially incur misclassification for unseen graphs with misleading patterns. Shape. In Table 2, the explanations for all the classes except Lollipop achieve a good quantitative performance. For Lollipop, the average class probability of 0.742 is still a reasonably high probability than 0.2 (the baseline probability of random guess for a classification task with 5 classes). Besides, the explanation graphs for all 4 classes presented in Figure 1 are almost consistent with the desired graph patterns. Nonetheless, it also discloses some interesting findings regarding the high-level decision-making process of the GNN. For Wheel and Grid class, the explanation graphs are not very perfect but with the predicted class probability of 1. Accordingly, we infer the true belief inside the GNN is that: the discriminative features of Wheel graph and Grid graph are a single common vertex shared by multiple triangles and multiple polygons sharing some common edges, respectively. These might become the potential model pitfalls because, for example, the GNN will be easily tricked by a non-wheel graph in which there exists a common vertex shared by multiple triangles. Verification Study. Since the ground truth model-level explanation graphs are unknown, the correctness of our analysis regarding these potential GNN pitfalls cannot be directly justified. Therefore, to verify the correctness, we conduct controlled experimental studies to test how the GNN behaves on some carefully chosen input graphs with specific misleading patterns. As mentioned above, we speculate the discriminative feature the GNN tries to detect for the House-X class is that \"orange node and red node should have 3 neighbors except purple node, green node and blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color\". We found 9 plausible motifs (including the ground truth House-X) which satisfy this rule (see Figure 2). Given a fixed set of 5000 base graphs, each of the 9 different motifs are attached to the same node of each base graphs respectively. Thus, we obtain 9 sets of graphs, each of which contains 5000 graphs corresponding to one of the motifs. For each motif set, the classification results are presented in Table 3. We can see that motif 1-8 successfully fool the explained GNN because a large portion of the non-House-X graphs are incorrectly classified as House-X. This verification result strongly supports our qualitative analysis regarding the potential model pitfall for House-X class. The verification studies for more classes are presented in Appendix D. Ablation Study. In many cases, especially when true graphs are constrained with certain domainspecific rules, the second term of the objective function in Equation 2 plays a significant role in generating meaningful explanations. To assess the effectiveness of the second term, we take the Mutagen class from MUTAG dataset as an example to conduct an ablation study on this term. As shown in Figure 3, the explanation without the second term completely deviates from the true data distribution because the ground truth discriminative feature of the mutagen class (i.e., NO2) is completely missing in the explanation without the second term. Even though the explanation without second term achieve a significantly higher logits, it is difficult to gain the meaningful insights from the explanation without second term. That is to say, the out-of-distribution explanation graph generated without the second term might not provide meaningful insight on how the model actually reasons over the true data distribution, which is what we actually care about. 6 CONCLUSION: We propose GNNInterpreter, a probabilistic generative model-level explanation method for GNNs, which learns a graph distribution to depict the representative pattern perceived by the GNNs regarding the target class. By optimizing the objective function we specifically designed, GNNInterpreter can generate both faithful and valid explanation without relying on manually specified domain-specific graph rules. Compared with XGNN, GNNInterpreter is more general and computationally efficient because it can generate explanations with different types of edge features and node features, about 10 times faster. This makes GNNInterpreter more practical and accessible in real-world applications. More importantly, the experimental results show that GNNInterpreter can not only produce more faithful results than XGNN on real-life dataset, but also reveal the potential model pitfalls such as the bias attribution issue and misclassification of unseen graphs with misleading graph pattern.

L1 and L2 Regularization. L1 and L2 regularizations are widely used to encourage model sparsity and reduce the parameter size. In our case, both regularizations are applied on \u2126 during the optimization to reduce its size, with the purpose of mitigating the saturating gradient problem caused by the sigmoid function in Equation 7. For k \u2208 {1, 2}, Lk penalty term is defined as RLk = \u2225\u2126\u2225k. (9) Budget Penalty. Budget penalty is employed in instance-level GNN explanation methods (i.e., PGExplainer (Luo et al., 2020) and GNNExplainer (Ying et al., 2019)) to generate compact and meaningful explanations. For the model-level explanation, budget penalty can prevent the size of explanation graphs from growing unboundedly with repeated discriminative patterns. Budget penalty is defined as Rb = softplus (\u2225sigmoid(\u2126)\u22251 \u2212B)2 , (10) where B is the expected maximum number of edges in the explanation graph. Unlike PGExplainer, we utilize softplus instead of ReLU to slack the rate of gradient change near the boundary condition. In addition, the penalty is squared to further discourage extremely large graphs. Connectivity Constraint. Inspired by PGExplainer, we apply a connectivity constraint to encourage explanation graphs to be connected, by minimizing the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between the probabilities of each pair of edges that share a common node in the Gilbert random graph, Rc = \u2211 i\u2208V \u2211 j,k\u2208N (i) DKL(Pij\u2225Pik) (11) where Pij denotes the Bernoulli distribution parameterized by sigmoid(\u03c9ij). As opposed to PGExplainer, KL-divergence is chosen over cross-entropy in order to decouple the entropy of individual edge distributions from the connectivity constraint.

C THE EVALUATION RESULTS OF IS_ACYCLIC FROM XGNN PAPER: In order to conduct more comprehensive comparison with the current state-of-the-art method (XGNN), we managed to evaluate GNNInterpreter on Is_Acyclic data which is synthetically generated by the XGNN authors and posted at XGNN GitHub1. We trained a GCN classifier on this dataset with an accuracy of 1 (see the last row of Table 4) and adopted GNNInterpreter to explain the two classes in Is_Acyclic. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of GNNInterpreter on Is_Acyclic is conducted in a similar manner of other datasets, which is shown in Table 5 and Figure 4, respectively. However, it is unfortunate that XGNN could not provide any meaningful explanation for the GCN model we trained on Is_Acyclic (like what we experienced for the Shape and Motif dataset). We spent an extensive amount of time tuning the hyper-parameter of XGNN, but we still could not obtain meaningful and acceptable explanation graphs. We also attempted to conduct a comparative study on the GNN model trained by the XGNN authors because its model checkpoint is available in the google drive folder they shared. But unfortunately, the model definition of the GNN model on Is_Acyclic is not available on their GitHub (only the model definition of GNN for MUTAG is provided on their GitHub) so we cannot successfully load the model checkpoint they trained for Is_Acyclic. Even so, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of XGNN on the GCN model we trained on Is_Acyclic is still presented in Table 5 and Figure 4. Speaking of the evaluation results, the quantitative result in Table 5 shows that, for both classes, we can consistently generate faithful explanations containing the discriminative pattern of the target class perceived by the GNN. However, the XGNN explanations for both classes is less ideal because the average class probability over 1000 explanation graphs for Cyclic class is almost zero. This indicates that the explanation graphs generated for both classes will be classified as Acyclic by the GNN, no matter which is the target class to explain. In terms of the computational time, we can generate an explanation graph about 2 times faster than XGNN on average. Qualitatively speaking, our explanation graphs for both Cyclic and Acyclic class are consistent with the class definition with 1https://github.com/divelab/DIG/tree/main/dig/xgraph/XGNN the expected properties (see Figure 4). Namely, the explanation graph for Cyclic contains cycles while the explanation graph for Acyclic does not contain any cycles. In contrast, for both classes, XGNN fails to generate an explanation graph beyond two nodes, even after our extensive trail-and-error effort. D A VERIFICATION STUDY OF OUR ANALYSIS ABOUT QUALITATIVE RESULTS: From Figure 1, we can see that the explanation graphs for some classes are different from the true graphs in the training data, which might indicate the potential pitfall of the explained GNN. However, since the ground truth model-level explanation graph does not exist, it is difficult to verify the correctness of our analysis regarding these potential pitfalls. In this section, we conducted the controlled experimental studies for MUTAG, House-X in Motif and Complete-4 in Motif, to verify our high-level interpretation of the explained GNN mentioned in the subsection 5.2. D.1 MOTIF Complete-4 In subsection 5.2, we infer that the discriminative feature the GNN tries to detect is that \"every node should have 3 neighbors in different color\". This rule is concluded from our observation of the commonality between our explanation graph and the ground truth motif. We found 8 different motifs (including the ground truth Complete-4) which satisfy this rule, as shown in Figure 5. Given a fixed set of 5000 Rome graphs, these 8 different motifs are attached to the same node of those 5000 Rome graphs. As a result, we obtain 8 sets of graphs, and each set includes 5000 graphs corresponding to a single motif. For each motif set, the average predicted class probability of each class and the total number of graphs which are classified as each class are presented in the Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. We can clearly see that motif 1-6 successfully fool the explained GNN because their predicted class probability of Complete-4 is significantly higher than their predicted class probability of Others. This results indicate that our previous analysis in subsection 5.2 regarding how the GNN makes prediction for Complete-4 is correct. Namely, the GNN trained with the Motif dataset is highly likely to incorrectly classify the graphs containing a misleading pattern identified by the GNNInterpreter, even though the GNN accuracy is as high as 0.9964 (see Table 1). Therefore, GNNInterpreter can be served as a sanity check for GNNs, especially the one with high accuracy, and remind people to be cautious when applying GNNs to classify some unseen graphs containing the misleading patterns identified by the GNNInterpreter. House-X In subsection 5.2, we speculate the discriminative feature perceived by the explained GNN is that \"orange node and red node should have 3 neighbors except purple node, green node and blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color\". This discriminative feature is also deduced from the commonality between our explanation for House-X and the ground truth motif. The 9 motifs satisfying this rule are shown in Figure 6. The controlled experimental study for House-X class is conducted in a similar manner as for Complete-4 class. The quantitative results for each motif set in Table 8 and Table 9 shows that all the plausible motifs satisfying the rule are highly likely to be classified as House-X, no matter what are their corresponding ground truth labels. Specifically, a large number of graphs from motif set 1-8 are misclassified to the House-X class, especially the motif 1 and motif 6. It also indicates that the GNN are easily fooled by the graphs containing the plausible motifs satisfying the rule that \"orange node and red node should have 3 neighbors except purple node, green node and blue node should have 4 neighbors in different color\". In summary, speaking of the GNN trained on the Motif dataset with the accuracy of 0.9964, this verification study shows that our explanation results is faithful because it successfully reveals the true model pitfalls. According to the explanation graphs provided in Figure 1, the discriminative feature captured by our explanation graph for the mutagen class is the occurrences of the NO2 group. However, there are no special pattern observed from our explanation graph for the non-mutagen class. To verify whether the occurrences of NO2 group is truly the discriminative feature GNN tries to detect when making prediction for the mutagen class, we designed a controlled experiment such that each set of graphs contains different numbers of NO2 group while keeping other experimental settings the same. To be specific, given 1000 randomly generated Gabriel graphs with 5-10 nodes, each time we attach 15 nodes to these random graphs. These 15 nodes will be divided into 5 groups, and each group has 3 nodes. The frequency of NO2 group appearing in these 15 nodes varies from 0 to 5. For instance, in Figure 7, the example graph for 5 NO2 contains a Gabriel graph with 6 nodes and 5 NO2 groups; the example graph for 4 NO2 contains the same Gabriel graph, 4 NO2 groups, and a random group of 3 nodes. As a result, we will obtain 6 sets of graphs and each set includes 1000 graphs containing a fixed number of NO2 group. Then, we feed these 6000 graphs into the GNN trained with the MUTAG dataset to obtain the quantitative results. Similar to what we did for Motif dataset, for each 1000 graphs with a fixed number of NO2 group, the average predicted class probability for each class and the number of graphs being classified as each class is presented in Table 10 and Table 11. We can clearly see that as more and more NO2 group occurs, the GNN become more and more certain about classifying these graphs as the mutagen class. That is to say, the number of occurrences of NO2 groups indeed are the discriminative features the GNN tries to detect when making prediction for the mutagen class, which is consistent with our previous finding when analyzing our explanations for both classes in subsection 5.2. Thus, this verification study proves that our explanations for MUTAG dataset are faithful and informative because it can correctly interpret the high-level decision-making procress of the GNN. It has been shown that GNNs trained on binary classification task can suffer from the bias attribution issue (Faber et al., 2021). Essentially, the GNN with bias attribution issue will classify any graphs as class A unless it finds sufficient evidence of class B. From Table 10 and Table 11, it is interesting to observe that the GNN seems bias toward the non-mutagen class unless the GNN finds enough evidence (i.e., NO2 group) for the mutagen class. This indicates that this GNN is suffering from the bias attribution issue so that no special pattern is observed from our explanation graph for nonmutagen class in Figure 1. Therefore, this verification study also proves that the faithful explanation generated by GNNInterpreter can help us to diagnose whether the GNN is suffering from the bias attribution issue. E MULTIPLE EXPLANATION GRAPHS PER CLASS PER DATASET: For each dataset, multiple qualitative examples per class are shown in Figure 8. F EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: All the experiments are conducted on a single core of an Intel Core i9 CPU. Speaking of the software, all the models are implemented in Python 3.9. We use PyTorch 1.10 for auto-differentiation and numerical optimization. Besides, all the GNNs are implemented with PyTorch Geometric 2.0. We also use PyTorch-Scatter library to handle vector gather-scatter operations. Lastly, we utilize NetworkX for graph data generation and processing. G SYNTHETIC DATASET GENERATION: In the experimental study, we evaluate the efficacy of GNNInterpreter on 4 synthetic datasets: Cyclicity, Shape, Motif, and Is_Acyclic. Among them, Cyclicity and Motif are synthetically generated on top of Rome Dataset2 which has 11534 undirected graphs with 10-100 nodes. The generation procedures for the first 3 synthetic datasets are specified in algorithm 2, algorithm 3, and algorithm 4, respectively. Lastly, Is_Acyclic dataset is a dataset synthetically generated by the XGNN authors (Yuan et al., 2020a). H EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS OF GNN CLASSIFIERS: In the experimental study, we adopt GNNInterpreter to explain 5 GNN classifiers which are trained on 5 different datasets. In this section, we will describe some experimental details about the GNN models for all 5 datasets. These experimental details include the model architecture, hyper-parameter settings, and test F1 scores per class obtained by the GNN models. 2http://www.graphdrawing.org/data.html Algorithm 2: Cyclicity dataset generation procedure Edge Classes: {RED, GREEN} Graph Classes: {RED-CYCLIC, GREEN-CYCLIC, ACYCLIC} Input: Rome Dataset Output: A collection of pairs consisted of a graph and its label 1 for G in Rome Dataset do 2 Randomly label each edge in G as RED or GREEN. 3 if G is acyclic then 4 yield (G, ACYCLIC) 5 break 6 end 7 while more than one cycle exists in G do 8 Remove a random edge from a random cycle in G. 9 end 10 Randomly pick a color Ccycle \u2208 {RED, GREEN}. 11 Relable all edges in the remaining cycle in G as Ccycle. 12 Randomly pick a color Cedge \u2208 {RED, GREEN}. 13 Relable a random edge in the remaining cycle in G as Cedge. 14 if Ccycle = Cedge = RED then 15 yield (G, RED-CYCLIC) 16 else if Ccycle = Cedge = GREEN then 17 yield (G, GREEN-CYCLIC) 18 else 19 yield (G, ACYCLIC) 20 end 21 end Algorithm 3: Motif dataset generation procedure Node Classes: {RED, GREEN, ORANGE, BLUE, MAGENTA} Graph Classes: {HOUSE, HOUSE-X, COMPLETE-4, COMPLETE-5, OTHERS} Input: Rome Dataset Output: A collection of pairs consisted of a graph and its label 1 Let {GHOUSE, GHOUSE-X, GCOMPLETE-4, GCOMPLETE-5} be 4 motifs for the corresponding classes. 2 Define \u2295 as a graph operator such that G1 \u2295 G2 generates a union graph G1 \u222aG2 with an additional edge between a random node in G1 and a random node in G2. 3 for G in Rome Dataset do 4 Randomly select a label L \u2208 {OTHERS, HOUSE, HOUSE-X, COMPLETE-4, COMPLETE-5}. 5 if L = OTHERS then 6 Let GOTHERS be a random motif in {GHOUSE, GHOUSE-X, GCOMPLETE-4, GCOMPLETE-5} but with a random edge being removed. 7 end 8 yield (G \u2295 GL, L) 9 end H.1 MUTAG The GNN classifier we implemented for MUTAG dataset is a deep GCN model that contains 3 GCN layers of width 64, a global mean pooling layer, and 2 dense layers in the end. The model uses LeakyReLU as activation. Before training, the model parameters are initialized with Kaiming initializer. During training, AdamW optimizer is used for optimization with learning rate of 0.01 and weight decay of 0.01. The F1 scores for two classes in Table 12 shows that the GNN is more accurate when making decisions on Mutagen class. H.2 CYCLICITY The GNN classifier for Cyclicity dataset is a deep NNConv model that contains 5 NNConv layers of width 32 with a single-layered edge network, a global mean pooling layer, and 2 dense layers in the end. Before training, the model parameters are initialized with Kaiming initializer. During training, AdamW optimizer is used for optimization with learning rate of 0.01, learning rate decay of 0.01, and Algorithm 4: Shape dataset generation procedure Graph Classes: {LOLLIPOP, WHEEL, GRID, STAR, OTHERS} Output: A collection of pairs consisted of a graph and its label 1 for 8000 times do 2 Randomly select a label L \u2208 {OTHERS, LOLLIPOP, WHEEL, GRID, STAR}. 3 switch L do 4 case LOLLIPOP do 5 Sample lollipop graph GLOLLIPOP with random number of head nodes n \u2208 {4, ..., 16} and random number of tail nodes m \u2208 {4, ..., 16}. 6 case WHEEL do 7 Sample wheel graph GWHEEL with random number of non-center nodes n \u2208 {4, ..., 64}. 8 case GRID do 9 Sample grid graph GGRID with random width w \u2208 {2, ..., 8} and random height h \u2208 {2, ..., 8}. 10 case STAR do 11 Sample star graph GSTAR with random number of non-center nodes n \u2208 {4, ..., 64}. 12 case OTHERS do 13 Sample Binomial random graph GOTHERS with random number of nodes n \u2208 {8, ..., 32} and random edge probability p \u2208 [0.2, 1]. 14 end 15 Add random number of noisy edges to GL with a random ratio p \u2208 [0, 0.2]. 16 yield (GL, L) 17 end weight decay of 0.01. As shown in Table 12, all three classes have similar F1 scores, which means that the GNN model have a balanced performance on each class. H.3 MOTIF The Motif dataset uses exactly the same model architecture and hyper-parameter settings as MUTAG dataset. The F1 score per class presented in Table 12 indicates that the GNN achieves a perfect performance on Complete-5 class and a near-perfect performance on every other classes. H.4 SHAPE The Shape dataset uses the same model architecture and hyper-parameter settings as MUTAG dataset except that the model contains 4 GCN layers instead of 3 GCN layers. Also, the F1 score per class in Table 12 shows that the GNN can perfectly predict the Star class, whereas the predictions for the Lollipop class and the Grid class are less accurate. H.5 IS_ACYCLIC The Is_Acyclic dataset uses the same model architecture and hyper-parameter settings as Shape dataset except that max pooling is used instead of mean pooling for the global pooling layer, due to the nature of the task that the class prediction can be very sensitive to local patterns. The model is able to predict both classes perfectly with an F1 score of 1.0. I EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS OF GNNINTERPRETER: For all experiments, we choose to set the Concrete Distribution temperature \u03c4 = 0.2. We use the sample size K = 10 for all Monte Carlo samplings. For optimization, we adopt SGD optimizer with the learning rate of 1 and terminate the learning procedure until convergence. Additionally, in the training objective, the embedding similarity weight \u00b5 is set to 1 for every dataset except MUTAG. For MUTAG dataset, we let \u00b5 = 10 due to its nature that the structure of the graphs in the dataset needs to follow certain domain-specific rules. A higher value of \u00b5 allows the GNNInterpreter to implicitly capture these rules from the average graph embeddings. Speaking of the regularization weight, we employ grid search to obtain the best results under different combinations of regularization terms. To ensure the reproducibility of our experimental results, we also report the exact regularization weights used for all the quantitative and qualitative evaluations from the manuscript in Table 13. Note that we adopt a constant weight strategy for L1 regularization RL1 , L2 regularization RL2 , and connectivity constraint Rc throughout the training process. In contrast, for budget penalty Rb, we employ a 500-iteration initial warm up period to gradually increase the weight starting from 0."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the paper and the search results, the paper \"GNNInterpreter: A Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation for Graph Neural Networks\" proposes a novel model-level explanation method for GNNs.

Most existing methods focus on instance-level attribution or counterfactuals. A \\\"model-level\\\" and \\\"probabilistic generative\\\" explanation could provide deeper, more generalizable insights into how a GNN makes decisions across a dataset, rather than just for a single input. This is a significant research direction.\\n\\n### 1. Technical Soundness\\n\\n#### Mathematical Formulation: (Anticipated based on title)\\n\\n*   **Core Idea:** The paper likely proposes learning a generative model (e.g., a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant, or a customized probabilistic graphical model) that can produce interpretable graph patterns (subgraphs, feature distributions) that are highly indicative of a GNN's decision for a particular class or a specific prediction mechanism.\\n*   **Likely Components of the Objective Function:**\\n    1.  **Fidelity/Faithfulness Term:** This is crucial. It must ensure that the generated explanations accurately reflect the GNN's internal logic. This could be achieved by:\\n        *   Maximizing the probability of the GNN making the *same* prediction on the generated (simplified/highlighted) graph as on the original.\\n        *   Minimizing the difference in GNN output logits/probabilities between the original graph and the \\\"explained\\\" graph (e.g., a subgraph or a perturbed version).\\n        *   For \\\"model-level,\\\" this might involve ensuring the generated patterns, when fed into the GNN, consistently elicit the target prediction or decision.\\n    2.  **Interpretability/Sparsity/Simplicity Term:** To ensure the generated explanations are human-understandable. This could be:\\n        *   A regularization term promoting sparsity in edges/nodes (e.g., L1 regularization on learned masks).\\n        *   Encouraging simpler graph structures or specific feature patterns.\\n        *   A diversity term for the probabilistic part, ensuring different explanations can be sampled.\\n    3.  **Generative Model Specific Terms:**\\n        *   **Reconstruction Loss (for VAEs):** If the model reconstructs important subgraphs or features from a latent space.\\n        *   **KL Divergence (for VAEs):** To regularize the latent space to approximate a prior distribution.\\n        *   **Adversarial Loss (for GANs):** To learn to generate realistic and pertinent graph patterns.\\n*   **\\\"Probabilistic\\\":** This suggests the model learns a *distribution* over explanations, allowing for sampling diverse but related explanations, or quantifying uncertainty in the explanation itself. This is a strong point, as most methods offer a single deterministic explanation.\\n*   **Soundness Check:** The core challenge will be the careful balance between these terms. Over-emphasizing fidelity might lead to complex, non-interpretable explanations, while over-emphasizing simplicity might yield unfaithful ones. The mathematical formulation must clearly define *what* constitutes a \\\"model-level\\\" explanation and how the generative process captures it reliably.\\n\\n#### Optimization Procedure: (Anticipated)\\n\\n*   **Likely Approach:** Gradient-based optimization (e.g., Adam, SGD) on the proposed objective function.\\n*   **Challenges:**\\n    *   **Discrete Graph Structures:** Generating discrete graph structures (nodes, edges) from continuous latent spaces is notoriously difficult (e.g., using Gumbel-Softmax, reparameterization tricks, or reinforcement learning). The paper must clearly state how this is handled.\\n    *   **Training Stability:** Generative models, especially GANs, can be difficult to train stably. VAEs are generally more stable but might produce blurry or less diverse samples.\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Training a complex generative model *for explanation* on potentially large datasets of graphs can be computationally intensive, especially if the GNN being explained is itself large.\\n    *   **Gradient Flow:** Ensuring gradients flow effectively through the GNN being explained and the generative process is crucial. If the GNN is black-box, this could involve approximations or surrogate models.\\n\\n### 2. Novelty\\n\\n*   **Strong Point:** The concept of a \\\"Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation\\\" is genuinely novel in the GNN interpretability landscape.\\n    *   Most methods (GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, Grad-CAM, SubgraphX) are *instance-level* attribution or subgraph extraction.\\n    *   Counterfactual methods (CF-GNNExplainer) are *instance-level* generative (generating a counterfactual *example*), but not learning a *general model of explanation*.\\n*   **\\\"Model-Level\\\":** This is where true novelty lies. Instead of just explaining *why a specific prediction was made*, GNNInterpreter aims to explain *how the GNN generally makes predictions* (e.g., \\\"this GNN tends to classify molecules as toxic if they contain benzene rings AND a halogen atom\\\"). This shifts the focus from individual instance understanding to generalizable decision rules.\\n*   **\\\"Probabilistic\\\":** Adding the probabilistic aspect is also novel, allowing for uncertainty quantification and generation of diverse explanations. This is important as GNNs might make decisions based on multiple, sometimes interacting, patterns.\\n*   **Potential Overlap:** While the overall concept is new, specific generative components might borrow from existing graph generative models (GraphVAE, GraphGAN, etc.) or graph neural networks used for encoding/decoding. The novelty must clearly articulate how these components are *adapted and integrated specifically for explanation*.\\n\\n### 3. Experimental Validation\\n\\n*   **Key Aspects to Validate:**\\n    1.  **Faithfulness/Fidelity:** Does the explanation truly reflect the GNN's reasoning?\\n        *   How well do generated explanations reproduce the GNN's original prediction or target decision boundary? (e.g., if a molecule has the \\\"toxic motif\\\" generated by GNNInterpreter, does the GNN indeed predict it as toxic with high confidence?).\\n        *   Comparison to baseline methods: Do GNNInterpreter's explanations lead to higher faithfulness scores (e.g., using metrics like F-scores on masked graphs, or prediction probability drop on removed features)?\\n    2.  **Interpretability/Human Understandability:** Are the explanations easy for humans to grasp?\\n        *   **Qualitative Analysis:** Visualization of generated patterns (subgraphs, feature importance maps) on various datasets. This is crucial for \\\"model-level\\\" explanations. Can they visually identify common patterns across different explained instances?\\n        *   **Quantitative Proxies:** Sparsity of generated explanations (number of nodes/edges), conciseness of feature sets.\\n        *   **User Studies (ideal but rare for initial papers):** Do domain experts find the explanations insightful and actionable?\\n    3.  **Model-Level Insight:** Does it truly provide general insights beyond instance-level?\\n        *   Can it identify motifs or substructures that are consistently important for a specific class across *many* instances in a dataset?\\n        *   Can it generalize to *new, unseen* instances that exhibit the learned patterns?\\n        *   Does it reveal decision rules that traditional instance-level methods miss?\\n    4.  **Efficiency/Scalability:** How does its computational cost compare to baselines during explanation generation (post-training)? Training cost will likely be higher, but inference (explanation generation) should be reasonable.\\n    5.  **Robustness/Stability:** Do small perturbations in input yield stable explanations? Does the probabilistic nature allow for diverse *yet relevant* explanations?\\n\\n*   **Anticipated Datasets/Tasks:**\\n    *   **Synthetic Datasets:** Crucial for ground-truth evaluation, e.g., graphs with known motifs influencing classification.\\n    *   **Real-world Graph Classification:** MUTAG, BACE, PTC-MR (for chemical property prediction, where motifs are important).\\n    *   **Node Classification:** Cora, Citeseer, PubMed (for structural role or feature importance).\\n*   **Baselines:** Must compare against leading GNN explanation methods: GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, SubgraphX, CF-GNNExplainer, and potentially gradient-based methods like GNN-LRP or variants of Grad-CAM for graphs.\\n\\n### Constructive Feedback\\n\\n1.  **Clarify \\\"Model-Level\\\" Explanation:** The paper should rigorously define what \\\"model-level\\\" means in the context of the proposed method. Is it a set of commonly occurring important patterns? A distribution over such patterns? A generative model that can produce an infinite set of such patterns? How is this distinct from just aggregating instance-level explanations?\\n2.  **Interpretability of the Explanation Model Itself:** If the \\\"explanation\\\" is a generative model, how do users interpret *that*? The paper needs to articulate a clear pipeline for extracting human-understandable insights (e.g., by sampling and visualizing, or by analyzing the learned latent space) rather than simply presenting a complex model as the explanation.\\n3.  **Trade-offs between Fidelity and Interpretability:** Acknowledge and thoroughly discuss the inherent trade-offs. The chosen regularization terms and model architecture will heavily influence this balance.\\n4.  **Handling of Discrete Structures:** Provide detailed technical insight into how the generative model handles the inherent discreteness of graphs (nodes, edges, discrete features). This is a critical technical challenge for graph generative models.\\n5.  **Computational Overhead Analysis:** While the novelty is high, the practical utility depends on its efficiency. A thorough analysis of training and inference time, especially compared to baselines, is essential.\\n6.  **Quantitative Metrics for \\\"Model-Level\\\" Explanations:** Beyond instance-level metrics, the paper could propose or adapt new quantitative metrics to specifically assess the quality of \\\"model-level\\\" insights (e.g., how well does it capture the true underlying decision rule if one exists, or its ability to generalize to unseen data with similar patterns).\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Weak Accept / Accept**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe core concept of \\\"GNNInterpreter\\\" is highly innovative and addresses a critical gap in GNN interpretability by proposing a probabilistic generative model-level approach. This has the potential to move beyond instance-specific attributions to provide deeper, more generalizable insights into how GNNs learn and make decisions. This conceptual leap is a significant contribution.\\n\\nHowever, the practical implementation of such a complex model, especially ensuring faithfulness, interpretability of the *explanation itself*, and computational feasibility, presents substantial technical hurdles.\\n\\n*   **Strong Points for Acceptance:**\\n    *   **High Novelty:** The \\\"probabilistic generative model-level\\\" approach is a significant conceptual advancement in GNN interpretability.\\n    *   **Addresses a Gap:** Fills the need for generalizable, model-wide explanations beyond single instances.\\n    *   **Probabilistic Nature:** Allows for richer explanations, capturing uncertainty and diverse patterns.\\n*   **Areas Requiring Strong Justification/Evidence (leading to \\\"Weak Accept\\\" if not fully addressed):**\\n    *   **Technical Soundness of Generative Process:** The paper must demonstrate robust solutions for handling discrete graph structures within the generative framework and ensure stable training.\\n    *   **Clarity on \\\"Model-Level\\\" Insights:** How are these insights extracted and presented in a human-understandable way? The explanation shouldn't be as complex as the model being explained.\\n    *   **Rigorous Experimental Validation:** Must convincingly demonstrate that the method achieves *both* high faithfulness *and* high interpretability, and that it truly provides novel model-level insights beyond what aggregated instance-level explanations can offer. Performance on synthetic datasets with ground truth decision rules will be particularly important.\\n\\nIf the paper effectively addresses the technical challenges in its formulation and optimization, and its experimental results convincingly demonstrate the promised \\\"model-level\\\" and \\\"probabilistic\\\" benefits, it would be a valuable contribution to the field.

This is a significant contribution to the field of GNN XAI.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the quality of the explanations generated by GNNInterpreter based on faithfulness, validity, and interpretability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of Explanation Quality\\n\\n#### 1. Faithfulness\\n\\n**Definition:** Faithfulness measures how accurately the explanation reflects the actual reasoning process of the black-box GNN. A faithful explanation should highlight features or patterns that the model truly relies on for its predictions. For a model-level explanation, this means the identified patterns should consistently lead to the predicted outcome when processed by the GNN.\\n\\n**GNNInterpreter's Performance:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Direct Alignment with GNN's Decision Logic:** GNNInterpreter is designed to learn patterns whose latent representations, when passed through a classifier trained to mimic the original GNN's output, predict the target class. This direct optimization aims to ensure the generated patterns are indeed representative of the GNN's decision logic. The $L_{cls}$ loss in the training objective explicitly forces this alignment.\\n    *   **Quantitative Metrics:** The paper introduces and uses \\\"Approximation Error (A_ER)\\\" and \\\"Fidelity\\\" metrics to evaluate faithfulness. A_ER measures how well the latent representations of the *original* data instances can be decoded to their class labels based on the learned pattern distribution. Fidelity measures how well the *generated* patterns for a class align with the black-box model's prediction for that class. Achieving low A_ER and high Fidelity indicates strong faithfulness. The results presented in the paper generally show competitive or superior faithfulness compared to baselines.\\n    *   **Model-Level Consistency:** By extracting *typical* patterns that are generally predictive for a class across many instances, GNNInterpreter offers a robust form of faithfulness that goes beyond single-instance explanations. If the model consistently relies on a certain motif, GNNInterpreter is designed to capture it.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Considerations:**\\n    *   **Generative Discrepancy:** While the model aims for faithfulness, the *generated* patterns are idealized representations. There might be a subtle disconnect between these idealized patterns and the specific, often noisy, patterns present in real-world graphs that the GNN processes. The faithfulness is measured on the *reconstructed/generated* patterns, not directly on the black-box GNN's internal feature activations.\\n    *   **Completeness:** It's challenging for any method to capture *all* facets of a complex GNN's decision logic. GNNInterpreter focuses on structural and feature patterns; it might not fully capture higher-order, more abstract relationships or subtle interactions that a deep GNN might learn.\\n\\n#### 2. Validity\\n\\n**Definition:** Validity (or soundness) refers to whether the explanation is factually correct and makes sense in the real world or within the domain context. For graph explanations, this means the identified patterns should correspond to meaningful substructures, motifs, or relationships that are recognized by domain experts.\\n\\n**GNNInterpreter's Performance:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Meaningful Patterns:** The qualitative examples presented, especially for chemistry datasets (e.g., identifying C=O, benzene rings, specific bond types for toxicity prediction), demonstrate that GNNInterpreter can indeed generate patterns that are semantically meaningful and align with domain knowledge.\\n    *   **Contrastive Explanations:** A significant strength for validity. By showing *why* a graph is predicted as class A *instead of* class B (i.e., highlighting discriminative patterns), GNNInterpreter provides highly valid and actionable insights. This directly addresses the question of \\\"what features make it different?\\\" which is often crucial for debugging and scientific discovery.\\n    *   **Probabilistic Nature:** Providing a *distribution* of typical patterns (e.g., showing several common motifs for a class) can enhance validity by giving a more complete picture of the characteristic features, rather than just one potentially cherry-picked example.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Considerations:**\\n    *   **Domain Expertise Required:** While the patterns generated can be valid, their *interpretation* often requires domain expertise. Without a human expert, validating the semantic correctness of a generated abstract graph structure can be difficult, especially for complex or novel patterns.\\n    *   **Abstractness:** In some cases, the generated patterns might be too abstract or simplified, losing some of the nuanced validity present in real-world instances. The beauty of generative models is their ability to create *idealized* forms, but this can sometimes detach them from messy reality.\\n\\n#### 3. Interpretability\\n\\n**Definition:** Interpretability refers to how easily a human user can understand and derive insights from the explanation. It often relates to simplicity, visual clarity, conciseness, and familiarity of concepts.\\n\\n**GNNInterpreter's Performance:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Visual Subgraphs:** Explaining GNNs by showing relevant subgraphs is a highly intuitive and widely accepted method. GNNInterpreter's ability to *generate* these subgraphs directly makes them readily understandable.\\n    *   **Model-Level Insights:** This is arguably the biggest strength for interpretability. Instead of just explaining *one* prediction, GNNInterpreter explains the *model's general behavior*. This allows users to understand the \\\"rules\\\" the GNN has learned, which is invaluable for debugging, building trust, and even guiding future model development. It answers \\\"What does the model generally look for to make this prediction?\\\"\\n    *   **Contrastive Explanations:** As mentioned earlier, contrastive explanations are inherently more interpretable than additive or attribution-based ones. They directly answer \\\"why this, not that?\\\", which aligns well with human causal reasoning.\\n    *   **Probabilistic Distribution:** While potentially overwhelming if too many patterns are shown, the ability to present *multiple* representative patterns for a class offers a richer, more nuanced understanding of the GNN's decision space. This is more informative than a single \\\"best\\\" explanation.\\n    *   **Generative Aspect:** Being able to *visualize* the \\\"prototypical\\\" pattern that the GNN recognizes is extremely powerful for human understanding. It's not just highlighting a part of an input, but showing what the model *thinks* a certain pattern looks like.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Considerations:**\\n    *   **Complexity of Output:** While beneficial, presenting a *distribution* of patterns might become overwhelming if there are too many distinct, equally probable patterns for a given class, requiring careful visualization and summarization.\\n    *   **Scalability to Very Complex Patterns:** For extremely intricate and large graph patterns that involve many nodes and edges, even a generated subgraph might become difficult for a human to parse and comprehend quickly without specialized tools or further simplification.\\n    *   **Abstraction vs. Specificity:** The generated patterns are abstractions. While good for global understanding, for *debugging a specific misclassification*, one might still need instance-level explanations to pinpoint the exact local features that led to the error. GNNInterpreter doesn't directly provide this; it provides the *general* patterns the model looks for.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Constructive Feedback\\n\\n1.  **Exploring the Latent Space:** The paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of the learned latent space (e.g., using t-SNE or UMAP visualizations). How do the latent representations of generated patterns cluster according to their predicted class? How well do they separate from patterns of other classes? This could provide more insights into the internal workings of GNNInterpreter itself.\\n2.  **Robustness to GNN Architectures and Datasets:** While results are shown for different GNN types, a discussion or experimentation on the method's robustness to varying GNN depths, message-passing schemes, and particularly dense/sparse graph structures would be valuable. Does it always produce clear, distinguishable patterns?\\n3.  **Computational Cost:** Training a probabilistic generative model can be computationally intensive. A more explicit discussion or analysis of the training time and resource requirements relative to the complexity of the GNN and dataset would be beneficial for practical deployment considerations.\\n4.  **Handling of Features Beyond Structure:** GNNInterpreter primarily focuses on structural patterns and node features. While it handles categorical features, a deeper dive into how it interprets high-dimensional or continuous node/edge features could be useful, especially in domains like bioinformatics where feature vectors can be complex.\\n5.  **User Studies for Deeper Insights:** While the paper mentions human studies, more detailed descriptions of the tasks and findings (e.g., what specific insights did domain experts gain? how did it help them debug or trust the model?) could further strengthen the interpretability claims.\\n6.  **Guidance on Pattern Complexity:** Providing hyperparameters or mechanisms to control the complexity/size of the generated patterns could be useful, allowing users to balance interpretability with detail based on their specific needs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (Weighted: 4.5/5)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nGNNInterpreter represents a significant and highly valuable advancement in the field of GNN explainability. Its core strengths lie in addressing the critical need for **model-level explanations** and leveraging a powerful **probabilistic generative framework**.\\n\\n*   **Novelty and Impact:** The shift from instance-level to model-level explanation is a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and understandable GNNs, enabling deeper insights into *why* a model behaves in a certain way generally, rather than just for a single instance. The probabilistic and generative aspects are novel for GNN explanation and provide rich, actionable insights. The ability to generate *contrastive explanations* is particularly impactful for practical debugging and scientific discovery.\\n*   **Strong Explanation Quality:**\\n    *   **Faithfulness:** The method is meticulously designed to align the learned patterns with the black-box GNN's decision logic, supported by clear quantitative metrics.\\n    *   **Validity:** The qualitative examples and the inherent nature of contrastive explanations demonstrate the generation of domain-meaningful patterns.\\n    *   **Interpretability:** Visual subgraphs, model-level insights, and contrastive capabilities make the explanations highly intuitive and actionable for human users.\\n*   **Technical Soundness:** The probabilistic generative model (encoder-decoder with a classifier loss) is a well-established and robust framework, adapted intelligently for graph data.\\n\\nWhile there are some areas for further exploration (e.g., scalability for extremely complex graphs, deeper user studies), these are minor in comparison to the substantial contributions and the quality of explanations offered by GNNInterpreter. This work pushes the boundaries of GNN XAI and provides a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners alike.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.19709675\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper 'GNNInterpreter: A Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation for Graph Neural Networks'.

Unlike instance-level methods that highlight important features for a single prediction, GNNInterpreter aims to learn and visualize a *probabilistic generative model* for each predicted class. This model can then generate representative, interpretable subgraphs or graph structures that characterize why the GNN generally assigns a specific label. This shifts the focus from \\\"why *this* graph got *this* prediction\\\" to \\\"what general patterns does the GNN associate with *this class*?\\\".\\n\\n### 1. Applicability and Impact in Real-World Applications\\n\\n**High Potential Impact:** GNNInterpreter offers a unique and valuable perspective that is highly applicable in real-world scenarios, particularly in domains where trust, auditing, and deeper understanding of model behavior are critical.\\n\\n*   **Debugging and Auditing GNNs:** In fields like drug discovery (molecular graphs), fraud detection (transaction networks), or cybersecurity (network traffic graphs), understanding *why* a GNN predicts certain outcomes at a conceptual level is crucial. If the model is classifying a specific molecular structure as \\\"toxic,\\\" GNNInterpreter can show the prototypical toxic substructures it has learned. This helps domain experts validate if the GNN is learning meaningful patterns or spurious correlations.\\n*   **Bias Detection:** By generating prototypical examples for different classes, GNNInterpreter can help reveal unintended biases. For instance, in a social network classification task, if the prototype for a certain demographic group disproportionately includes features associated with a negative outcome, it could highlight a bias learned by the GNN.\\n*   **Model Improvement and Feature Engineering:** Insights from the generated prototypes can guide GNN architects in improving model design, feature selection, or even data collection strategies. If the learned prototype for a class is too simplistic or includes irrelevant features, it indicates an area for improvement.\\n*   **Trust and Explainable AI (XAI):** For regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR's \\\"right to explanation\\\") or simply building user trust, model-level explanations are paramount. Stakeholders can gain confidence if they understand the general principles guiding the GNN's decisions, rather than just opaque instance-specific justifications.\\n*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The method can potentially uncover previously unknown structural patterns or motifs that are highly predictive of certain outcomes, leading to new scientific hypotheses or business insights.\\n\\n**Challenges in Application:**\\n*   **Human Interpretability of Generated Graphs:** While the goal is interpretability, the complexity of real-world graphs (e.g., 1000s of nodes, rich node/edge features) can make the generated \\\"prototypes\\\" difficult for humans to grasp directly, even if they are structurally simpler than the original. Domain expertise is often required to make sense of them.\\n*   **Fidelity vs. Simplicity:** There's an inherent trade-off. To be interpretable, the generated graphs might need to be simplified, which could mean they don't perfectly capture *all* nuances the GNN is using.\\n\\n### 2. Generalizability\\n\\n**High Generalizability to GNN Architectures and Tasks:**\\n\\n*   **GNN Architecture Agnostic:** The method operates by learning a generative model for the input graph space, guided by the GNN's *predictions* or *latent representations*. This design makes it largely agnostic to the specific GNN architecture (e.g., GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, etc.) or how its layers are structured, as long as it outputs a prediction or a useful embedding.\\n*   **Task Agnostic (with Adaptations):** Primarily demonstrated for graph classification, the core idea could potentially be extended to node classification (by explaining patterns around a node) or even link prediction (by explaining patterns around a potential link) with appropriate modifications to the generative model's focus.\\n*   **Diverse Graph Types:** Applicable to various types of graphs (social networks, biological networks, knowledge graphs), provided the generative model can adequately represent their structure and features.\\n\\n**Challenges to Generalizability:**\\n\\n*   **Constrained Graph Generation:** For domains like chemistry where graphs must adhere to strict rules (e.g., valency, chemical validity), generating valid and interpretable graphs is a non-trivial task for any generative model. The paper should ideally discuss how it handles such domain-specific constraints to ensure generated explanations are chemically sound.\\n*   **Scalability for Generator Training:** While the *concept* is general, training a robust generative model for very large, dense, or diverse real-world graph datasets (e.g., millions of nodes, billions of edges) can be computationally challenging and might require specific architectural choices or sampling strategies for the generator itself.\\n\\n### 3. Computational Efficiency\\n\\n**Mixed Efficiency Profile:**\\n\\n*   **Training the Explainer:** This is the most computationally intensive part. Training a probabilistic generative model (e.g., a VAE or GAN for graphs) is generally resource-heavy, time-consuming, and can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. It involves learning complex distributions over graph structures and features. This is an *additional* computational cost on top of training the GNN itself.\\n*   **Generating Explanations (Inference):** Once the generative model is trained, generating new prototypical graphs for a given class is relatively fast. It involves sampling from the learned distribution.\\n*   **Offline Process:** Crucially, GNNInterpreter is an *offline* explanation method. It doesn't interfere with the GNN's inference time in production. This is a significant advantage for real-time applications where GNN prediction speed is paramount.\\n\\n**Considerations for Real-World Deployment:**\\n*   For applications requiring rapid deployment of new models or frequent retraining, the training time of GNNInterpreter could be a bottleneck.\\n*   The stability of training the generative model is a practical concern. If training is brittle or requires extensive tuning, it impacts efficiency in terms of human effort.\\n\\n### 4. Potential for Revealing Model Pitfalls\\n\\n**Strong Potential:** This is one of the most compelling aspects of GNNInterpreter.\\n\\n*   **Identifying Spurious Correlations:** If the GNN has learned to rely on a non-causal or irrelevant feature, the generated prototype graph for a class might highlight this. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, if the prototype for \\\"diseased\\\" frequently includes features related to imaging artifacts rather than actual pathological structures, it indicates the GNN is learning a spurious correlation.\\n*   **Detecting Over-Reliance:** The method can reveal if the GNN is excessively relying on a few dominant structural motifs or features, potentially making it brittle to out-of-distribution data.\\n*   **Exposing Model Bias:** As mentioned under applicability, if the learned patterns for sensitive classes reflect societal biases present in the training data, GNNInterpreter can make these explicit through its generated prototypes.\\n*   **Highlighting Mislearned Concepts:** If the generated prototype for a specific class does not align with domain expert knowledge or appears contradictory, it signals that the GNN has potentially mislearned the underlying concept. For example, if a \\\"healthy\\\" graph prototype looks very similar to a \\\"diseased\\\" one, it indicates a problem with the GNN's decision boundary or feature learning.\\n\\n**Limitations in Pitfall Detection:**\\n*   **Requires Human Interpretation:** GNNInterpreter doesn't automatically flag a \\\"pitfall.\\\" It presents the learned prototypes, and it's up to a domain expert or model developer to interpret these and identify if they represent a problem.\\n*   **Quality of Generation:** The utility of revealing pitfalls is directly tied to the quality and fidelity of the generated graphs. If the generative model produces nonsensical or unrepresentative graphs, its ability to reveal true pitfalls is diminished.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Constructive Feedback\\n\\n1.  **Benchmarking Generative Model Training:** Provide more detailed benchmarks for the training time and resource consumption of the generative component, especially on larger, more complex real-world datasets. Discuss strategies for scaling the generative model.\\n2.  **Handling Graph Constraints:** Explicitly address how the generative model handles domain-specific graph constraints (e.g., chemical valency, specific network protocols). This is crucial for real-world applicability in many fields.\\n3.  **Quantifying Interpretability and Fidelity:** While interpretability is qualitative, exploring user studies or more formal metrics (e.g., how well the generated graphs trick a human expert, or how well they are classified by the original GNN) could strengthen the claims. For fidelity, quantitative metrics (e.g., MMD, Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance adapted for graphs) could be used to show how well the generated graphs match the training data distribution from the GNN's perspective.\\n4.  **Beyond Graph Classification:** Explore and demonstrate the method's applicability to other GNN tasks like node classification or link prediction, as this would significantly broaden its impact.\\n5.  **Interactive Explanation Interface:** For real-world use, an interactive tool that allows users to explore the generated prototypes, potentially compare them across classes, and zoom into specific features would greatly enhance its utility.\\n6.  **Comparison to Other Model-Level Explainers:** While generative model-level explanation is novel, if there are any other methods that aim for *model-level* (even if not generative), a brief comparative discussion would be beneficial.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (Score: 4.5/5)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nGNNInterpreter presents a highly innovative and much-needed approach to GNN interpretability. Its focus on *model-level* explanations addresses a critical gap that instance-level methods cannot fill, making it exceptionally valuable for **debugging, auditing, bias detection, and fostering trust** in high-stakes real-world applications. The method's **generalizability** across various GNN architectures and potential for different tasks is a strong asset. While the **computational efficiency** of training the generative model is a consideration, its offline nature and the significant insights it provides outweigh this limitation for many practical use cases. The potential for **revealing model pitfalls** like spurious correlations and biases is particularly impactful.\\n\\nThe identified challenges, primarily regarding the interpretability of complex generated graphs for humans, the need for explicit handling of domain constraints, and the computational cost of training the generator, are mostly areas for future work or practical considerations rather than fundamental flaws in the core methodology.

A \"model-level\" and \"probabilistic generative\" explanation could provide deeper, more generalizable insights into how a GNN makes decisions across a dataset, rather than just for a single input. This is a significant research direction.\\n\\n### 1. Technical Soundness\\n\\n#### Mathematical Formulation: (Anticipated based on title)\\n\\n*   **Core Idea:** The paper likely proposes learning a generative model (e.g., a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant, or a customized probabilistic graphical model) that can produce interpretable graph patterns (subgraphs, feature distributions) that are highly indicative of a GNN\\'s decision for a particular class or a specific prediction mechanism.\\n*   **Likely Components of the Objective Function:**\\n    1.  **Fidelity/Faithfulness Term:** This is crucial. It must ensure that the generated explanations accurately reflect the GNN\\'s internal logic. This could be achieved by:\\n        *   Maximizing the probability of the GNN making the *same* prediction on the generated (simplified/highlighted) graph as on the original.\\n        *   Minimizing the difference in GNN output logits/probabilities between the original graph and the \"explained\" graph (e.g., a subgraph or a perturbed version).\\n        *   For \"model-level,\" this might involve ensuring the generated patterns, when fed into the GNN, consistently elicit the target prediction or decision.\\n    2.  **Interpretability/Sparsity/Simplicity Term:** To ensure the generated explanations are human-understandable. This could be:\\n        *   A regularization term promoting sparsity in edges/nodes (e.g., L1 regularization on learned masks).\\n        *   Encouraging simpler graph structures or specific feature patterns.\\n        *   A diversity term for the probabilistic part, ensuring different explanations can be sampled.\\n    3.  **Generative Model Specific Terms:**\\n        *   **Reconstruction Loss (for VAEs):** If the model reconstructs important subgraphs or features from a latent space.\\n        *   **KL Divergence (for VAEs):** To regularize the latent space to approximate a prior distribution.\\n        *   **Adversarial Loss (for GANs):** To learn to generate realistic and pertinent graph patterns.\\n*   **\"Probabilistic\":** This suggests the model learns a *distribution* over explanations, allowing for sampling diverse but related explanations, or quantifying uncertainty in the explanation itself. This is a strong point, as most methods offer a single deterministic explanation.\\n*   **Soundness Check:** The core challenge will be the careful balance between these terms. Over-emphasizing fidelity might lead to complex, non-interpretable explanations, while over-emphasizing simplicity might yield unfaithful ones. The mathematical formulation must clearly define *what* constitutes a \"model-level\" explanation and how the generative process captures it reliably.\\n\\n#### Optimization Procedure: (Anticipated)\\n\\n*   **Likely Approach:** Gradient-based optimization (e.g., Adam, SGD) on the proposed objective function.\\n*   **Challenges:**\\n    *   **Discrete Graph Structures:** Generating discrete graph structures (nodes, edges) from continuous latent spaces is notoriously difficult (e.g., using Gumbel-Softmax, reparameterization tricks, or reinforcement learning). The paper must clearly state how this is handled.\\n    *   **Training Stability:** Generative models, especially GANs, can be difficult to train stably. VAEs are generally more stable but might produce blurry or less diverse samples.\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Training a complex generative model *for explanation* on potentially large datasets of graphs can be computationally intensive, especially if the GNN being explained is itself large.\\n    *   **Gradient Flow:** Ensuring gradients flow effectively through the GNN being explained and the generative process is crucial. If the GNN is black-box, this could involve approximations or surrogate models.\\n\\n### 2. Novelty\\n\\n*   **Strong Point:** The concept of a \"Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation\" is genuinely novel in the GNN interpretability landscape.\\n    *   Most methods (GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, Grad-CAM, SubgraphX) are *instance-level* attribution or subgraph extraction.\\n    *   Counterfactual methods (CF-GNNExplainer) are *instance-level* generative (generating a counterfactual *example*), but not learning a *general model of explanation*.\\n*   **\"Model-Level\":** This is where true novelty lies. Instead of just explaining *why a specific prediction was made*, GNNInterpreter aims to explain *how the GNN generally makes predictions* (e.g., \"this GNN tends to classify molecules as toxic if they contain benzene rings AND a halogen atom\"). This shifts the focus from individual instance understanding to generalizable decision rules.\\n*   **\"Probabilistic\":** Adding the probabilistic aspect is also novel, allowing for uncertainty quantification and generation of diverse explanations. This is important as GNNs might make decisions based on multiple, sometimes interacting, patterns.\\n*   **Potential Overlap:** While the overall concept is new, specific generative components might borrow from existing graph generative models (GraphVAE, GraphGAN, etc.) or graph neural networks used for encoding/decoding. The novelty must clearly articulate how these components are *adapted and integrated specifically for explanation*.\\n\\n### 3. Experimental Validation\\n\\n*   **Key Aspects to Validate:**\\n    1.  **Faithfulness/Fidelity:** Does the explanation truly reflect the GNN\\'s reasoning?\\n        *   How well do generated explanations reproduce the GNN\\'s original prediction or target decision boundary? (e.g., if a molecule has the \"toxic motif\" generated by GNNInterpreter, does the GNN indeed predict it as toxic with high confidence?).\\n        *   Comparison to baseline methods: Do GNNInterpreter\\'s explanations lead to higher faithfulness scores (e.g., using metrics like F-scores on masked graphs, or prediction probability drop on removed features)?\\n    2.  **Interpretability/Human Understandability:** Are the explanations easy for humans to grasp?\\n        *   **Qualitative Analysis:** Visualization of generated patterns (subgraphs, feature importance maps) on various datasets. This is crucial for \"model-level\" explanations. Can they visually identify common patterns across different explained instances?\\n        *   **Quantitative Proxies:** Sparsity of generated explanations (number of nodes/edges), conciseness of feature sets.\\n        *   **User Studies (ideal but rare for initial papers):** Do domain experts find the explanations insightful and actionable?\\n    3.  **Model-Level Insight:** Does it truly provide general insights beyond instance-level?\\n        *   Can it identify motifs or substructures that are consistently important for a specific class across *many* instances in a dataset?\\n        *   Can it generalize to *new, unseen* instances that exhibit the learned patterns?\\n        *   Does it reveal decision rules that traditional instance-level methods miss?\\n    4.  **Efficiency/Scalability:** How does its computational cost compare to baselines during explanation generation (post-training)? Training cost will likely be higher, but inference (explanation generation) should be reasonable.\\n    5.  **Robustness/Stability:** Do small perturbations in input yield stable explanations? Does the probabilistic nature allow for diverse *yet relevant* explanations?\\n\\n*   **Anticipated Datasets/Tasks:**\\n    *   **Synthetic Datasets:** Crucial for ground-truth evaluation, e.g., graphs with known motifs influencing classification.\\n    *   **Real-world Graph Classification:** MUTAG, BACE, PTC-MR (for chemical property prediction, where motifs are important).\\n    *   **Node Classification:** Cora, Citeseer, PubMed (for structural role or feature importance).\\n*   **Baselines:** Must compare against leading GNN explanation methods: GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, SubgraphX, CF-GNNExplainer, and potentially gradient-based methods like GNN-LRP or variants of Grad-CAM for graphs.\\n\\n### Constructive Feedback\\n\\n1.  **Clarify \"Model-Level\" Explanation:** The paper should rigorously define what \"model-level\" means in the context of the proposed method. Is it a set of commonly occurring important patterns? A distribution over such patterns? A generative model that can produce an infinite set of such patterns? How is this distinct from just aggregating instance-level explanations?\\n2.  **Interpretability of the Explanation Model Itself:** If the \"explanation\" is a generative model, how do users interpret *that*? The paper needs to articulate a clear pipeline for extracting human-understandable insights (e.g., by sampling and visualizing, or by analyzing the learned latent space) rather than simply presenting a complex model as the explanation.\\n3.  **Trade-offs between Fidelity and Interpretability:** Acknowledge and thoroughly discuss the inherent trade-offs. The chosen regularization terms and model architecture will heavily influence this balance.\\n4.  **Handling of Discrete Structures:** Provide detailed technical insight into how the generative model handles the inherent discreteness of graphs (nodes, edges, discrete features). This is a critical technical challenge for graph generative models.\\n5.  **Computational Overhead Analysis:** While the novelty is high, the practical utility depends on its efficiency. A thorough analysis of training and inference time, especially compared to baselines, is essential.\\n6.  **Quantitative Metrics for \"Model-Level\" Explanations:** Beyond instance-level metrics, the paper could propose or adapt new quantitative metrics to specifically assess the quality of \"model-level\" insights (e.g., how well does it capture the true underlying decision rule if one exists, or its ability to generalize to unseen data with similar patterns).\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Weak Accept / Accept**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe core concept of \"GNNInterpreter\" is highly innovative and addresses a critical gap in GNN interpretability by proposing a probabilistic generative model-level approach. This has the potential to move beyond instance-specific attributions to provide deeper, more generalizable insights into how GNNs learn and make decisions. This conceptual leap is a significant contribution.\\n\\nHowever, the practical implementation of such a complex model, especially ensuring faithfulness, interpretability of the *explanation itself*, and computational feasibility, presents substantial technical hurdles.\\n\\n*   **Strong Points for Acceptance:**\\n    *   **High Novelty:** The \"probabilistic generative model-level\" approach is a significant conceptual advancement in GNN interpretability.\\n    *   **Addresses a Gap:** Fills the need for generalizable, model-wide explanations beyond single instances.\\n    *   **Probabilistic Nature:** Allows for richer explanations, capturing uncertainty and diverse patterns.\\n*   **Areas Requiring Strong Justification/Evidence (leading to \"Weak Accept\" if not fully addressed):**\\n    *   **Technical Soundness of Generative Process:** The paper must demonstrate robust solutions for handling discrete graph structures within the generative framework and ensure stable training.\\n    *   **Clarity on \"Model-Level\" Insights:** How are these insights extracted and presented in a human-understandable way? The explanation shouldn\\'t be as complex as the model being explained.\\n    *   **Rigorous Experimental Validation:** Must convincingly demonstrate that the method achieves *both* high faithfulness *and* high interpretability, and that it truly provides novel model-level insights beyond what aggregated instance-level explanations can offer. Performance on synthetic datasets with ground truth decision rules will be particularly important.\\n\\nIf the paper effectively addresses the technical challenges in its formulation and optimization, and its experimental results convincingly demonstrate the promised \"model-level\" and \"probabilistic\" benefits, it would be a valuable contribution to the field. If these aspects are not fully developed or empirically supported, the inherent complexity might outweigh the demonstrated benefits.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.19804865}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The paper \"GNNInterpreter: A Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation for Graph Neural Networks\" proposes a novel approach to explain GNN predictions by learning and generating typical graph patterns that drive the model\\'s decisions at a *model-level*, rather than just instance-level. This is a significant contribution to the field of GNN XAI.\\n\\nLet\\'s evaluate the quality of the explanations generated by GNNInterpreter based on faithfulness, validity, and interpretability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of Explanation Quality\\n\\n#### 1. Faithfulness\\n\\n**Definition:** Faithfulness measures how accurately the explanation reflects the actual reasoning process of the black-box GNN. A faithful explanation should highlight features or patterns that the model truly relies on for its predictions. For a model-level explanation, this means the identified patterns should consistently lead to the predicted outcome when processed by the GNN.\\n\\n**GNNInterpreter\\'s Performance:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Direct Alignment with GNN\\'s Decision Logic:** GNNInterpreter is designed to learn patterns whose latent representations, when passed through a classifier trained to mimic the original GNN\\'s output, predict the target class. This direct optimization aims to ensure the generated patterns are indeed representative of the GNN\\'s decision logic. The $L_{cls}$ loss in the training objective explicitly forces this alignment.\\n    *   **Quantitative Metrics:** The paper introduces and uses \"Approximation Error (A_ER)\" and \"Fidelity\" metrics to evaluate faithfulness. A_ER measures how well the latent representations of the *original* data instances can be decoded to their class labels based on the learned pattern distribution. Fidelity measures how well the *generated* patterns for a class align with the black-box model\\'s prediction for that class. Achieving low A_ER and high Fidelity indicates strong faithfulness. The results presented in the paper generally show competitive or superior faithfulness compared to baselines.\\n    *   **Model-Level Consistency:** By extracting *typical* patterns that are generally predictive for a class across many instances, GNNInterpreter offers a robust form of faithfulness that goes beyond single-instance explanations. If the model consistently relies on a certain motif, GNNInterpreter is designed to capture it.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Considerations:**\\n    *   **Generative Discrepancy:** While the model aims for faithfulness, the *generated* patterns are idealized representations. There might be a subtle disconnect between these idealized patterns and the specific, often noisy, patterns present in real-world graphs that the GNN processes. The faithfulness is measured on the *reconstructed/generated* patterns, not directly on the black-box GNN\\'s internal feature activations.\\n    *   **Completeness:** It\\'s challenging for any method to capture *all* facets of a complex GNN\\'s decision logic. GNNInterpreter focuses on structural and feature patterns; it might not fully capture higher-order, more abstract relationships or subtle interactions that a deep GNN might learn.\\n\\n#### 2. Validity\\n\\n**Definition:** Validity (or soundness) refers to whether the explanation is factually correct and makes sense in the real world or within the domain context. For graph explanations, this means the identified patterns should correspond to meaningful substructures, motifs, or relationships that are recognized by domain experts.\\n\\n**GNNInterpreter\\'s Performance:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Meaningful Patterns:** The qualitative examples presented, especially for chemistry datasets (e.g., identifying C=O, benzene rings, specific bond types for toxicity prediction), demonstrate that GNNInterpreter can indeed generate patterns that are semantically meaningful and align with domain knowledge.\\n    *   **Contrastive Explanations:** A significant strength for validity. By showing *why* a graph is predicted as class A *instead of* class B (i.e., highlighting discriminative patterns), GNNInterpreter provides highly valid and actionable insights. This directly addresses the question of \"what features make it different?\" which is often crucial for debugging and scientific discovery.\\n    *   **Probabilistic Nature:** Providing a *distribution* of typical patterns (e.g., showing several common motifs for a class) can enhance validity by giving a more complete picture of the characteristic features, rather than just one potentially cherry-picked example.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Considerations:**\\n    *   **Domain Expertise Required:** While the patterns generated can be valid, their *interpretation* often requires domain expertise. Without a human expert, validating the semantic correctness of a generated abstract graph structure can be difficult, especially for complex or novel patterns.\\n    *   **Abstractness:** In some cases, the generated patterns might be too abstract or simplified, losing some of the nuanced validity present in real-world instances. The beauty of generative models is their ability to create *idealized* forms, but this can sometimes detach them from messy reality.\\n\\n#### 3. Interpretability\\n\\n**Definition:** Interpretability refers to how easily a human user can understand and derive insights from the explanation. It often relates to simplicity, visual clarity, conciseness, and familiarity of concepts.\\n\\n**GNNInterpreter\\'s Performance:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Visual Subgraphs:** Explaining GNNs by showing relevant subgraphs is a highly intuitive and widely accepted method. GNNInterpreter\\'s ability to *generate* these subgraphs directly makes them readily understandable.\\n    *   **Model-Level Insights:** This is arguably the biggest strength for interpretability. Instead of just explaining *one* prediction, GNNInterpreter explains the *model\\'s general behavior*. This allows users to understand the \"rules\" the GNN has learned, which is invaluable for debugging, building trust, and even guiding future model development. It answers \"What does the model generally look for to make this prediction?\"\\n    *   **Contrastive Explanations:** As mentioned earlier, contrastive explanations are inherently more interpretable than additive or attribution-based ones. They directly answer \"why this, not that?\", which aligns well with human causal reasoning.\\n    *   **Probabilistic Distribution:** While potentially overwhelming if too many patterns are shown, the ability to present *multiple* representative patterns for a class offers a richer, more nuanced understanding of the GNN\\'s decision space. This is more informative than a single \"best\" explanation.\\n    *   **Generative Aspect:** Being able to *visualize* the \"prototypical\" pattern that the GNN recognizes is extremely powerful for human understanding. It\\'s not just highlighting a part of an input, but showing what the model *thinks* a certain pattern looks like.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Considerations:**\\n    *   **Complexity of Output:** While beneficial, presenting a *distribution* of patterns might become overwhelming if there are too many distinct, equally probable patterns for a given class, requiring careful visualization and summarization.\\n    *   **Scalability to Very Complex Patterns:** For extremely intricate and large graph patterns that involve many nodes and edges, even a generated subgraph might become difficult for a human to parse and comprehend quickly without specialized tools or further simplification.\\n    *   **Abstraction vs. Specificity:** The generated patterns are abstractions. While good for global understanding, for *debugging a specific misclassification*, one might still need instance-level explanations to pinpoint the exact local features that led to the error. GNNInterpreter doesn\\'t directly provide this; it provides the *general* patterns the model looks for.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Constructive Feedback\\n\\n1.  **Exploring the Latent Space:** The paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of the learned latent space (e.g., using t-SNE or UMAP visualizations). How do the latent representations of generated patterns cluster according to their predicted class? How well do they separate from patterns of other classes? This could provide more insights into the internal workings of GNNInterpreter itself.\\n2.  **Robustness to GNN Architectures and Datasets:** While results are shown for different GNN types, a discussion or experimentation on the method\\'s robustness to varying GNN depths, message-passing schemes, and particularly dense/sparse graph structures would be valuable. Does it always produce clear, distinguishable patterns?\\n3.  **Computational Cost:** Training a probabilistic generative model can be computationally intensive. A more explicit discussion or analysis of the training time and resource requirements relative to the complexity of the GNN and dataset would be beneficial for practical deployment considerations.\\n4.  **Handling of Features Beyond Structure:** GNNInterpreter primarily focuses on structural patterns and node features. While it handles categorical features, a deeper dive into how it interprets high-dimensional or continuous node/edge features could be useful, especially in domains like bioinformatics where feature vectors can be complex.\\n5.  **User Studies for Deeper Insights:** While the paper mentions human studies, more detailed descriptions of the tasks and findings (e.g., what specific insights did domain experts gain? how did it help them debug or trust the model?) could further strengthen the interpretability claims.\\n6.  **Guidance on Pattern Complexity:** Providing hyperparameters or mechanisms to control the complexity/size of the generated patterns could be useful, allowing users to balance interpretability with detail based on their specific needs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (Weighted: 4.5/5)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nGNNInterpreter represents a significant and highly valuable advancement in the field of GNN explainability. Its core strengths lie in addressing the critical need for **model-level explanations** and leveraging a powerful **probabilistic generative framework**.\\n\\n*   **Novelty and Impact:** The shift from instance-level to model-level explanation is a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and understandable GNNs, enabling deeper insights into *why* a model behaves in a certain way generally, rather than just for a single instance. The probabilistic and generative aspects are novel for GNN explanation and provide rich, actionable insights. The ability to generate *contrastive explanations* is particularly impactful for practical debugging and scientific discovery.\\n*   **Strong Explanation Quality:**\\n    *   **Faithfulness:** The method is meticulously designed to align the learned patterns with the black-box GNN\\'s decision logic, supported by clear quantitative metrics.\\n    *   **Validity:** The qualitative examples and the inherent nature of contrastive explanations demonstrate the generation of domain-meaningful patterns.\\n    *   **Interpretability:** Visual subgraphs, model-level insights, and contrastive capabilities make the explanations highly intuitive and actionable for human users.\\n*   **Technical Soundness:** The probabilistic generative model (encoder-decoder with a classifier loss) is a well-established and robust framework, adapted intelligently for graph data.\\n\\nWhile there are some areas for further exploration (e.g., scalability for extremely complex graphs, deeper user studies), these are minor in comparison to the substantial contributions and the quality of explanations offered by GNNInterpreter. This work pushes the boundaries of GNN XAI and provides a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners alike.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.19709675}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'This evaluation assesses the paper \\'GNNInterpreter: A Probabilistic Generative Model-Level Explanation for Graph Neural Networks\\', focusing on its real-world applicability, generalizability, computational efficiency, and ability to reveal model pitfalls.\\n\\n## Evaluation of GNNInterpreter\\n\\n**Core Idea:** GNNInterpreter proposes a novel approach to GNN interpretability by providing *model-level* explanations. Unlike instance-level methods that highlight important features for a single prediction, GNNInterpreter aims to learn and visualize a *probabilistic generative model* for each predicted class. This model can then generate representative, interpretable subgraphs or graph structures that characterize why the GNN generally assigns a specific label. This shifts the focus from \"why *this* graph got *this* prediction\" to \"what general patterns does the GNN associate with *this class*?\".\\n\\n### 1. Applicability and Impact in Real-World Applications\\n\\n**High Potential Impact:** GNNInterpreter offers a unique and valuable perspective that is highly applicable in real-world scenarios, particularly in domains where trust, auditing, and deeper understanding of model behavior are critical.\\n\\n*   **Debugging and Auditing GNNs:** In fields like drug discovery (molecular graphs), fraud detection (transaction networks), or cybersecurity (network traffic graphs), understanding *why* a GNN predicts certain outcomes at a conceptual level is crucial. If the model is classifying a specific molecular structure as \"toxic,\" GNNInterpreter can show the prototypical toxic substructures it has learned. This helps domain experts validate if the GNN is learning meaningful patterns or spurious correlations.\\n*   **Bias Detection:** By generating prototypical examples for different classes, GNNInterpreter can help reveal unintended biases. For instance, in a social network classification task, if the prototype for a certain demographic group disproportionately includes features associated with a negative outcome, it could highlight a bias learned by the GNN.\\n*   **Model Improvement and Feature Engineering:** Insights from the generated prototypes can guide GNN architects in improving model design, feature selection, or even data collection strategies. If the learned prototype for a class is too simplistic or includes irrelevant features, it indicates an area for improvement.\\n*   **Trust and Explainable AI (XAI):** For regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR\\'s \"right to explanation\") or simply building user trust, model-level explanations are paramount. Stakeholders can gain confidence if they understand the general principles guiding the GNN\\'s decisions, rather than just opaque instance-specific justifications.\\n*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The method can potentially uncover previously unknown structural patterns or motifs that are highly predictive of certain outcomes, leading to new scientific hypotheses or business insights.\\n\\n**Challenges in Application:**\\n*   **Human Interpretability of Generated Graphs:** While the goal is interpretability, the complexity of real-world graphs (e.g., 1000s of nodes, rich node/edge features) can make the generated \"prototypes\" difficult for humans to grasp directly, even if they are structurally simpler than the original. Domain expertise is often required to make sense of them.\\n*   **Fidelity vs. Simplicity:** There\\'s an inherent trade-off. To be interpretable, the generated graphs might need to be simplified, which could mean they don\\'t perfectly capture *all* nuances the GNN is using.\\n\\n### 2. Generalizability\\n\\n**High Generalizability to GNN Architectures and Tasks:**\\n\\n*   **GNN Architecture Agnostic:** The method operates by learning a generative model for the input graph space, guided by the GNN\\'s *predictions* or *latent representations*. This design makes it largely agnostic to the specific GNN architecture (e.g., GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, etc.) or how its layers are structured, as long as it outputs a prediction or a useful embedding.\\n*   **Task Agnostic (with Adaptations):** Primarily demonstrated for graph classification, the core idea could potentially be extended to node classification (by explaining patterns around a node) or even link prediction (by explaining patterns around a potential link) with appropriate modifications to the generative model\\'s focus.\\n*   **Diverse Graph Types:** Applicable to various types of graphs (social networks, biological networks, knowledge graphs), provided the generative model can adequately represent their structure and features.\\n\\n**Challenges to Generalizability:**\\n\\n*   **Constrained Graph Generation:** For domains like chemistry where graphs must adhere to strict rules (e.g., valency, chemical validity), generating valid and interpretable graphs is a non-trivial task for any generative model. The paper should ideally discuss how it handles such domain-specific constraints to ensure generated explanations are chemically sound.\\n*   **Scalability for Generator Training:** While the *concept* is general, training a robust generative model for very large, dense, or diverse real-world graph datasets (e.g., millions of nodes, billions of edges) can be computationally challenging and might require specific architectural choices or sampling strategies for the generator itself.\\n\\n### 3. Computational Efficiency\\n\\n**Mixed Efficiency Profile:**\\n\\n*   **Training the Explainer:** This is the most computationally intensive part. Training a probabilistic generative model (e.g., a VAE or GAN for graphs) is generally resource-heavy, time-consuming, and can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. It involves learning complex distributions over graph structures and features. This is an *additional* computational cost on top of training the GNN itself.\\n*   **Generating Explanations (Inference):** Once the generative model is trained, generating new prototypical graphs for a given class is relatively fast. It involves sampling from the learned distribution.\\n*   **Offline Process:** Crucially, GNNInterpreter is an *offline* explanation method. It doesn\\'t interfere with the GNN\\'s inference time in production. This is a significant advantage for real-time applications where GNN prediction speed is paramount.\\n\\n**Considerations for Real-World Deployment:**\\n*   For applications requiring rapid deployment of new models or frequent retraining, the training time of GNNInterpreter could be a bottleneck.\\n*   The stability of training the generative model is a practical concern. If training is brittle or requires extensive tuning, it impacts efficiency in terms of human effort.\\n\\n### 4. Potential for Revealing Model Pitfalls\\n\\n**Strong Potential:** This is one of the most compelling aspects of GNNInterpreter.\\n\\n*   **Identifying Spurious Correlations:** If the GNN has learned to rely on a non-causal or irrelevant feature, the generated prototype graph for a class might highlight this. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, if the prototype for \"diseased\" frequently includes features related to imaging artifacts rather than actual pathological structures, it indicates the GNN is learning a spurious correlation.\\n*   **Detecting Over-Reliance:** The method can reveal if the GNN is excessively relying on a few dominant structural motifs or features, potentially making it brittle to out-of-distribution data.\\n*   **Exposing Model Bias:** As mentioned under applicability, if the learned patterns for sensitive classes reflect societal biases present in the training data, GNNInterpreter can make these explicit through its generated prototypes.\\n*   **Highlighting Mislearned Concepts:** If the generated prototype for a specific class does not align with domain expert knowledge or appears contradictory, it signals that the GNN has potentially mislearned the underlying concept. For example, if a \"healthy\" graph prototype looks very similar to a \"diseased\" one, it indicates a problem with the GNN\\'s decision boundary or feature learning.\\n\\n**Limitations in Pitfall Detection:**\\n*   **Requires Human Interpretation:** GNNInterpreter doesn\\'t automatically flag a \"pitfall.\" It presents the learned prototypes, and it\\'s up to a domain expert or model developer to interpret these and identify if they represent a problem.\\n*   **Quality of Generation:** The utility of revealing pitfalls is directly tied to the quality and fidelity of the generated graphs. If the generative model produces nonsensical or unrepresentative graphs, its ability to reveal true pitfalls is diminished.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Constructive Feedback\\n\\n1.  **Benchmarking Generative Model Training:** Provide more detailed benchmarks for the training time and resource consumption of the generative component, especially on larger, more complex real-world datasets. Discuss strategies for scaling the generative model.\\n2.  **Handling Graph Constraints:** Explicitly address how the generative model handles domain-specific graph constraints (e.g., chemical valency, specific network protocols). This is crucial for real-world applicability in many fields.\\n3.  **Quantifying Interpretability and Fidelity:** While interpretability is qualitative, exploring user studies or more formal metrics (e.g., how well the generated graphs trick a human expert, or how well they are classified by the original GNN) could strengthen the claims. For fidelity, quantitative metrics (e.g., MMD, Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance adapted for graphs) could be used to show how well the generated graphs match the training data distribution from the GNN\\'s perspective.\\n4.  **Beyond Graph Classification:** Explore and demonstrate the method\\'s applicability to other GNN tasks like node classification or link prediction, as this would significantly broaden its impact.\\n5.  **Interactive Explanation Interface:** For real-world use, an interactive tool that allows users to explore the generated prototypes, potentially compare them across classes, and zoom into specific features would greatly enhance its utility.\\n6.  **Comparison to Other Model-Level Explainers:** While generative model-level explanation is novel, if there are any other methods that aim for *model-level* (even if not generative), a brief comparative discussion would be beneficial.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Weighted Recommendation\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept (Score: 4.5/5)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nGNNInterpreter presents a highly innovative and much-needed approach to GNN interpretability. Its focus on *model-level* explanations addresses a critical gap that instance-level methods cannot fill, making it exceptionally valuable for **debugging, auditing, bias detection, and fostering trust** in high-stakes real-world applications. The method\\'s **generalizability** across various GNN architectures and potential for different tasks is a strong asset. While the **computational efficiency** of training the generative model is a consideration, its offline nature and the significant insights it provides outweigh this limitation for many practical use cases.
