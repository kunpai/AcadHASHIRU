The paper title is: Leveraging Importance Weights in Subset Selection\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in several domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. In many tasks, this is achieved by heavily relying on extremely large labeled datasets. In addition to the storage costs and potential security/privacy concerns that come along with large datasets, training modern deep neural networks on such datasets also incur high computational costs. With the growing size of datasets in various domains, algorithm scalability is a real and imminent challenge that needs to be addressed. One promising way to solve this problem is with data subset selection, where the learner aims to find the most informative subset from a large number of training samples to approximate (or even improve upon) training with the entire training set. Such ideas have been extensively studied in k-means and k-median clustering (Har-Peled & Mazumdar, 2004), subspace approximation (Feldman et al., 2010), computational geometry (Agarwal et al., 2005), density estimation (Turner et al., 2021), to name a few. One particular approach for solving data subsampling involves the computation of coresets, which are weighted subsets of a dataset that can act as the proxy for the whole dataset to solve some optimization task. Coreset algorithms are primarily motivated with theoretical guarantees that bound the difference between the training loss (or other such objective) over the coreset and that over the full dataset under different assumptions on the losses and hypothesis classes (Mai et al., 2021; Munteanu et al., 2018; Curtin et al., 2019; Karnin & Liberty, 2019). However, in practice, most competitive subset selection algorithms, that are designed for general loss functions and arbitrary function classes, focus only on selecting informative subsets of the data and typically do not assign weights to the selected examples. These methods are, for example, based on some notion of model uncertainty (Scheffer et al., 2001), information gain (Argamon-Engelson & Dagan, 1999), loss gradients (Paul et al., 2021; Ash et al., 2019), or diversity (Sener & Savarese, 2017). Counter to this trend, we show that weighting the selected samples can be very beneficial. In this work, we present a subset selection algorithm called IWeS that is designed for general loss functions and hypothesis classes and that selects examples by importance sampling, a theoretically motivated and unbiased sampling technique. Importance sampling is conducted according to a specially crafted probability distribution and, importantly, each sampled example is weighted inversely proportional to its sampling probability when computing the training loss. We develop two types of sampling probability for different practical requirements (e.g. computational constraints and label availability), but in both cases, the sampling probability is based on the example\u2019s entropy-based score computed using a previously trained model. We note, the IWeS algorithm is similar to the IWAL active learning algorithm of Beygelzimer et al. (2009) as both are based on importance sampling. However, in contrast to IWAL, IWeS uses a different sampling probability definition with a focus on providing a practical method that is amenable to large deep networks and complex hypothesis classes. Through extensive experiments, we find that the IWeS algorithm is competitive for deep neural networks over several datasets. We compare our algorithm against four types of baselines whose sampling strategies leverage: the model\u2019s uncertainty over examples, diversity of selected examples, gradient information, and random sampling. Finally, we analyze a closely related albeit less practical algorithm that inspires the design of IWeS, called IWeS-V, proving it admits generalization and sampling rate guarantees that hold for general loss functions and hypothesis classes. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 1. We present the Importance Weighted Subset Selection (IWeS) algorithm that selects examples by importance sampling with a sampling probability based on a model\u2019s entropy, which is applicable to (and practical for) arbitrary model families including modern deep networks. In addition to the subset selection framework, IWeS also works in the active learning setting where the examples are unlabeled at selection time. 2. We demonstrate that IWeS achieves significant improvement over several baselines (Random, Margin, Least-Confident, Entropy, Coreset, BADGE) using VGG16 model for six common multi-class datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10-corrupted, CIFAR100, SVHN, Eurosat, Fashion MNIST), and using ResNet101 model for the large-scale multi-label OpenImages dataset. 3. We provide a theoretical analysis for a closely related algorithm, IWeS-V, in Section 4. We prove a O(1/ \u221a T ) generalization bound, which depends on the full training dataset size T . We further give a new definition of disagreement coefficient and prove a sampling rate bound by leveraging label information, which is tighter compared with the label complexity bound provided by Beygelzimer et al. (2009) that does not use label information. 1.1 RELATED WORK: Uncertainty. Uncertainty sampling, which selects examples that the model is least confident on, is favored by practitioners (Mussmann & Liang, 2018) and rather competitive among many recent algorithms (Yang & Loog, 2018). Uncertainty can be measured through entropy (Argamon-Engelson & Dagan, 1999), least confidence (Culotta & McCallum, 2005), and most popular is the margin between the most likely and the second most likely labels (Scheffer et al., 2001). Beygelzimer et al. (2009) makes use of a disagreement-based notion of uncertainty and constructs an importance weighted predictor with theoretical guarantees called IWAL, which is further enhanced by Cortes et al. (2019). However, IWAL is not directly suitable for use with complex hypothesis spaces, such as deep networks, since it requires solving a non-trivial optimization over a subset of the hypothesis class, the so-called version space, in order to compute sampling probabilities. We further discuss these difficulties in Section 4. Diversity. In another line of research, subsets are selected by enforcing diversity such as in the FASS (Wei et al., 2015) and Coreset (Sener & Savarese, 2017) algorithms. Wei et al. (2015) introduces a submodular sampling objective that trades off between uncertainty and diversity by finding a diverse set of samples from amongst those that the current trained model is most uncertain about. It was further explored by Kaushal et al. (2019) who designed a unified framework for data subset selection with facility location and dispersion-based diversity functions. Sener & Savarese (2017) show that the task of identifying a coreset in an active learning setting can be mapped to solving the k-center problem. Further recent works related to coreset idea are Mirzasoleiman et al. (2020); Killamsetty et al. (2021), where the algorithms select representative subsets of the training data to minimize the estimation error between the weighted gradient of selected subset and the full gradient. Loss Gradient. Another class of algorithms selects a subset by leveraging the loss gradients. For example, the GRAND score (Paul et al., 2021), or closely related EL2N score, leverages the average gradient across several different independent models to measure the importance of each sample. However, as such, it requires training several neural networks, which is computationally expensive. BADGE (Ash et al., 2019) is a sampling strategy for deep neural networks that uses k-MEANS++ on the gradient embedding of the networks to balance between uncertainty and diversity. Finally, for Algorithm 1 Importance Weighted Subset Selection (IWeS) Require: Labeled pool P , seed set size k0, subset batch size k, number of iterations R, weight cap parameter u. 1: Initialize the subset S = \u2205. 2: S0 \u2190 Draw k0 examples from P uniformly at random. 3: Set S = {(x, y, 1) : (x, y) \u2208 S0} and P = P\\S0 4: for r = 1, 2, . . . , R do 5: Set Sr = \u2205. 6: Train fr, gr on S using the weighted loss and independent random initializations. 7: while |Sr| < k do 8: Select (x, y) uniformly at random from P . 9: Set p(x, y) using entropy-based disagreement or entropy criteria shown in Eq (1) and (2). 10: Q \u223c Bernoulli(p(x, y)). 11: if Q = 1 then 12: Set Sr = Sr \u222a {( x, y,min ( 1 p(x,y) , u ))} and P = P\\ {(x, y)}. 13: end if 14: end while 15: S = S \u222a Sr. 16: end for 17: Train fR+1 on S using the weighted loss. 18: return S, fR+1 the sake of completeness, we note that importance weighting type approaches have also been used for the selection of examples within an SGD minibatch (Katharopoulos & Fleuret, 2018; Johnson & Guestrin, 2018), which can be thought of a change to the training procedure itself. In contrast, the problem setting we consider in this work requires explicitly producing a (weighted) subset of the training data and treats the training procedure itself as a black-box. These are a sampling of data subset selection algorithms, and we refer the reader to (Guo et al., 2022) for a more detailed survey. In this work, we choose at least one algorithm from each of the categories mentioned above, in particular, Margin (Scheffer et al., 2001), BADGE (Ash et al., 2019), and Coreset (Sener & Savarese, 2017) to compare against empirically in Section 3. However, before that, we first formally define the IWeS algorithm in the following section. 2 THE IWES ALGORITHM: We consider a practical batch streaming setting, where an algorithm processes one example at a time without updating its state until a batch of examples is selected. That is, like in standard streaming settings, the algorithm receives a labeled example, and decides whether to include it in the selected subset or not. Yet, the algorithm is only allowed to update its state after a fixed batch of examples have been selected in order to limit the overhead costs (e.g. this typically can include retraining models and extracting gradients). Unlike the pool-based setting where the algorithm receives the entire labeled pool beforehand, a batch streaming setting can be more appropriate when facing a vast training data pool since the algorithm can only process a subset of the pool without iterating over the whole pool. Note that any batch streaming algorithm can also be used in a pool-based setting, by simply streaming through the pool in a uniformly random fashion. At a high level, the IWeS algorithm selects examples by importance sampling where the sampling probability is based on the entropy of models trained on previously selected data. We define two sampling probabilities that allow us to trade-off between performance and the computational cost, as well as label-aware or an active learning setting leading to less label annotation costs. As we will subsequently see, these sampling definitions are both easy to use and work well in practice. To define the algorithm in more detail, we let X \u2208 Rd and Y = {1, . . . , c} denote the input space and the multi-class label space, respectively. We assume the data (x, y) is drawn from an unknown joint distributionD onX\u00d7Y . LetH = {h : X \u2192 Z} be the hypothesis class consisting of functions mapping from X to some prediction space Z \u2282 RY and let ` : Z \u00d7 Y \u2192 R denote the loss. The pseudocode of IWeS is shown in Algorithm 1. Initially, a seed set S0 (|S0| = k0) is selected uniformly at random from the labeled pool P . Then the algorithm proceeds in rounds r \u2208 [1, . . . , R] and it consists of two main components: training and sampling. At the training step at round r, the model(s) are trained using the importance-weighted loss, namely fr = arg minh\u2208H \u2211 (x,y,w)\u2208S w \u00b7 `(h(x), y) on the subset S, selected so far, in the previous r\u2212 1 rounds. Depending on the sampling strategy, we may need to randomly initialize two models fr, gr in which case they are trained independently on the same selected subset S, but with different random initializations. At the sampling step at round r, the IWeS algorithm calculates a sampling probably for example (x, y) \u2208 S based on one of the following definitions: \u2022 Entropy-based Disagreement. We define the sampling probability based on the disagreement on two functions with respect to entropy restricted to the labeled example (x, y). That is, p(x, y) = |Pfr (y|x) log Pfr (y|x)\u2212 Pgr (y|x) log Pgr (y|x)| (1) where Pfr (y|x) is the probability of class y with model fr given example x. If the two functions, fr, gr, disagree on the labeled example (x, y), then p(x, y) will be small and the example will be less likely to be selected. This definition is the closest to the IWeS-V algorithm analyzed in Section 4 and achieves the best performance when the computational cost of training two models is not an issue. In Appendix A, we show an efficient version of entropy-based disagreement that utilizes only one model and achieves similar performance. \u2022 Entropy. We define the sampling probability by the normalized entropy of the model fr trained on past selected examples: p(x, \u00b7) = \u2212 \u2211 y\u2032\u2208Y Pfr (y \u2032|x) log2 Pfr (y\u2032|x)/ log2 |Y|. (2) The sampling probability p(x, \u00b7) is high whenever the model class probability Pfr (y\u2032|x) is close to 1/|Y|, which is when the model is not confident about its prediction as it effectively randomly selects a label from Y . This definition does not use the label y and thus it can be used in an active learning setting where the algorithm can only access the unlabeled examples. Another advantage is that it only requires training one model, thereby saving some computational cost. We note that entropy-based sampling has been used in algorithms such as uncertainty sampling as discussed in the related works section, but using entropy to define importance weights has not been done in past literature. Based on one of these definitions, the IWeS algorithm then decides whether to include the example into the selected subset S by flipping a coin Q with chosen sampling probability p(x, y). If the example is selected, the example\u2019s corresponding weightw is set to 1p(x,y) , and the example is removed from the labeled pool P = P\\ {(x, y)}. This process is repeated until k examples have been selected. Below we use IWeS-dis as an abbreviation for IWeS algorithm with Entropy-based Disagreement sampling probability and IWeS-ent for IWeS algorithm with Entropy sampling probability. The weighted loss used to train the model can be written as 1|P| \u2211 i\u2208P Qi p(xi,yi) `(f(xi), yi) and it is an unbiased estimator of the population risk E(x,y)\u223cD[`(f(x), y)]. Yet such estimator can have a large variance when the model is highly confident in its prediction, that is whenever Pfr (y|x) is large, then p(x, y) is small. This may lead to training instability and one pragmatic approach to addressing this issue is by \u201cclipping\u201d the importance sampling weights (Ionides, 2008; Swaminathan & Joachims, 2015). Thus in our algorithm, we let u be the upper bound on the weight of the selected example. Although this clipping strategy introduces an additional parameter, we find it is not too sensitive and, as mentioned in the empirical section, set it to a fixed constant throughout our evaluation. 3 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION: We compare IWeS with state-of-the-art baselines on several image classification benchmarks. Specifically, we consider six multi-class datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), EUROSAT (Helber et al., 2019), CIFAR10 Corrupted (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), Fashion MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017) and one large-scale multi-label Open Images dataset (Krasin et al., 2017). In the multi-class setting, each image is associated with only one label. On the other hand, the multi-label Open Images dataset consists of 19,957 classes over 9M images, where each image contains binary labels for a small subset of the classes (on average 6 labels per image). Further details of each dataset can be found in Table 1 and Table 2 in the appendix. For all experiments, we consider a diverse set of standard baselines from both subset selection and active learning literature (discussed in Section 1.1). \u2022 Uncertainty Sampling selects top k examples on which the current model admits the highest uncertainty. There are three popular ways of defining model uncertainty s(x) of an example x, namely margin sampling, entropy sampling, and least confident sampling, and all are based on Pf [y\u0302|x], the probability of class y\u0302 given example x according to the model f . Margin sampling defines the model uncertainty of an example x as s(x) = 1 \u2212 (Pf [y\u03021|x] \u2212 Pf [y\u03022|x]) where y\u03021 = argmaxy\u2208Y Pf [y|x], y\u03022 = argmaxy\u2208Y\\y1 Pf [y|x] are the first and second most probable classes for model f . For entropy sampling, model uncertainty is defined as s(x) = \u2212 \u2211 y\u2208Y Pf (y\u0302|x) log(Pf (y\u0302|x)) while for least confidence sampling, it is defined as s(x) = 1\u2212maxy\u2208Y Pf (y\u0302|x). \u2022 BADGE of Ash et al. (2019) selects k examples by using the k-MEANS++ seeding algorithm using the gradient vectors, computed with respect to the penultimate layer using the most likely labels given by the latest model checkpoint. \u2022 Coreset (k-Center) of Sener & Savarese (2017) selects a subset of examples using their embeddings derived from the penultimate layer using the latest model checkpoint. In particular, the k examples are chosen using a greedy 2-approximation algorithm for the k-center problem. \u2022 Random Sampling selects k examples uniformly at random. 3.1 MULTI-CLASS EXPERIMENTS: Here, we compare the IWeS algorithm against the baselines on the six multi-class image datasets. We use the VGG16 architecture with weights that were pre-trained using ImageNet as well as add two fully-connected 4096 dimensional layers and a final prediction layer. Xavier uniform initialization is used for the final layers. For each dataset, we tune the learning rate by choosing the rate from the set {0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.1} that achieves best model performance on the seed set. We use batch SGD with the selected learning rate and fix SGD\u2019s batch size to 100. At each sampling round r, the model is trained to convergence on all past selected examples. For IWeS, we set the weight capping parameter to 2 for all datasets except for CIFAR10 which we decreased to 1.5 in order to reduce training instability. The embedding layer for BADGE and Coreset is extracted from the penultimate layer having a dimension of 4096. The effective dimension of the gradient vector in BADGE grows with the number of labels, which is problematic for CIFAR100 as it has 100 classes. More specifically, the runtime of BADGE is given by O (dkT ), which can be large for CIFAR100 since the dimension of the gradient vector from the penultimate layer is d = 4096 \u00d7 100, the size of the labeled pool is T=50K, and the number of examples selected in each round is k=5K. In order to solve this inefficiency for CIFAR100, we split the labeled pool randomly into 100 partitions and ran separate instances of the algorithm in each partition with batch size k/100. Each algorithm is initialized with an initial seed set that is sampled uniformly at random from the pool. After that, sampling then proceeds in a series of rounds r where the model is frozen until a batch k of examples is selected. The seed set size and sampling batch size k are set to 1K for CIFAR10, SVHN, EUROSAT, CIFAR10 Corrupted, Fashion MNIST, and to 5K for CIFAR100. The experiment was repeated for 5 trials. Any trial that encountered divergent training, i.e. the resulting model accuracy is more than three times below the standard error of model\u2019s accuracy on seed set, was dropped. We note that this happened infrequently (less than 3% of the time) and all reported averaged results have at least 3 trials. Figure 1 shows the mean and standard error of VGG16 model\u2019s accuracy on a held out test set comparing IWeS-dis to the baseline methods. The IWeS-dis algorithm either outperforms or matches the performance of the baseline algorithms for all datasets. We also find that margin sampling consistently performs well against the remaining baseline algorithms and that BADGE either matches the performance of margin sampling or slightly underperforms on some datasets (Eurosat, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR100). Coreset admits a similar and at times slightly poorer performance compared to random sampling. Next, Figure 2 compares the two variants of our algorithm: IWeS-dis and IWeS-ent. We find that the IWeS-dis performs slightly better than IWeS-ent on most of the datasets. This is not surprising since the IWeS-dis sampling probability leverages label information and more computational power, i.e. trains two models. As explained in Section 4, it also better fits our theoretical motivation. Nevertheless, it is important to note that IWeS-ent, without the label information, still consistently outperforms or matches the performance of the baselines for all the datasets. 3.2 MULTI-LABEL OPEN IMAGES EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we evaluate the performance of the IWeS algorithm on Open Images v6. We train a ResNet101 model on 64 Cloud two core TPU v4 acceleration, and apply batch SGD with batchsize of 6144 and an initial learning rate of 10\u22124 with decay logarithmically every 5\u00d7 108 examples. We add a global pooling layer with a fully connected layer of 128 dimensions as the final layers of the networks, which is needed by BADGE and Coreset baselines. The model is initialized with weights that were pre-trained on the validation split using 150K SGD steps, and at each sampling round, the model is trained on all past selected examples with an additional 15K SGD steps. In the previous section, our results show that the IWeS-dis algorithm only slightly outperforms the IWeS-ent algorithm on a few datasets. Additionally, since the IWeS-dis requires training two neural networks, which is computationally expensive in this scenario, we only test the performance of IWeS-ent. Since IWeS-ent doesn\u2019t use the label information, this also allows us to measure the performance of the algorithm in an active learning setting. Since Open Images is a multi-label dataset, the sampling algorithms must not only select the image, but also the class. That is, each example selected by an algorithm consists of an image-class pair with a corresponding binary label indicating whether the corresponding class is present in the image or not. In order to adapt IWeS-ent to the multi-label setting, the entropy sampling probability for each image-class pair is defined as p(x, \u00b7) = \u2212Pfr (y|x) log2 Pfr (y|x) \u2212 (1\u2212 Pfr (y|x)) log2 (1\u2212 Pfr (y|x)), where Pfr (y|x) is the model class probability of a positive label at round r. A seed set of size 300K is sampled uniformly at random from the pool, and at each sampling round r, the algorithms select 100K examples. Similarly to the previous section, in order to run BADGE on Open Images, we divide the pool into 100 partitions and run separate instances of the algorithm in each partition. For IWeS, the weight capping parameter is set to 10. Figure 3 shows the mean and standard error across 5 trials of the pooled average precision (Pooled AP) metric for each algorithm. As the number of selected examples increases, IWeS-ent outperforms all other baselines methods on the Open Images dataset. We also find that BADGE performs similarly or even slightly worse than the uncertainty-based sampling algorithms when the number of selected examples is smaller than 800K, and then outperforms all uncertainty-based sampling as the number of selected examples increases. Coreset initially performs better than random sampling, but at later sampling rounds, it admits a similar performance to random sampling. 4 THEORETICAL MOTIVATION: In order to theoretically motivate the IWeS algorithm, we analyze a closely related algorithm which we call IWeS-V, adapted from the IWAL algorithm of Beygelzimer et al. (2009). We prove that IWeS-V admits generalization bounds that scale with the dataset size T and sampling rate bounds that are in terms of a new disagreement coefficient tailored to the subset selection framework. Below, we let L(h) = E(x,y)\u223cD[`(h(x), y)] denote the expected loss of hypothesis h \u2208 H, and h\u2217 = argminh\u2208H L(h) be the best-in-class hypothesis. Without loss of generality, we consider a bounded loss ` : Z \u00d7 Y \u2192 [0, 1] mapping to the interval [0, 1]. Such a loss can be achieved by any bounded loss after normalization. For simplicity, we assume H is a finite set, but our results can be easily extended by standard covering arguments to more general hypothesis sets such as finite VC-classes. The IWeS-V algorithm operates on an i.i.d. example (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xT , yT ) drawn from D sequentially. It maintains a version spaceHt at any time t, withH1 = H. At time t, IWeS-V flips a coin Qt \u2208 {0, 1} with bias pt defined as pt = max f,g\u2208Ht `(f(xt), yt)\u2212 `(g(xt), yt) (3) whereHt = { h \u2208 Ht\u22121 : 1t \u2211t s=1 Qs ps `(h(xs), ys) \u2264 minh\u2032\u2208Ht\u22121 1t \u2211t s=1 Qs ps `(h\u2032(xs), ys) + \u2206t\u22121 } with \u2206t\u22121 = \u221a 8 log(2T (T+1)|H|2/\u03b4) t\u22121 . The example is selected if Qt = 1 and otherwise it is discarded. The main idea behind this algorithm is thus to define a sampling probability that is in terms of the disagreement between two hypothesis f, g that are not too far from the best model trained on the past selected data, i.e. minh\u2208Ht\u22121 1 t \u2211t s=1 Qs ps `(h(xs), ys). The formal IWeS-V algorithm pseudo-code (Algorithm 2) and all the theorem proofs can be found in Appendix B. In general, it is non-trivial to find two hypotheses f, g \u2208 Ht that maximize the expression in equation (3) and this main impracticality of IWeS-V is reason why we developed the IWeS algorithm of the previous section. This drawback is also shared by the IWAL algorithm of Beygelzimer et al. (2009), which computes a sampling probability very similar to that of equation (3), but with an additional maximization over the choice of y \u2208 Y in the definition of the sampling probability pt. Before continuing we explain how our practical algorithm IWeS-dis, specifically using sampling probability in equation (1), is closely related to the IWeS-V algorithm. Recall that the IWeS algorithm trains two models f and g each minimizing the importance-weighted loss using the data sampled so far. Therefore, each model exhibits reasonable training loss, i.e. they are expected to be included in the version space Ht of good hypothesis, while the different random initializations (in the case of non-convex neural network hypotheses) results in models that still differ in certain regions of the feature space. Thus, the difference in equation (1) can be thought of as a less aggressive version of the difference found in the maximization of equation (3). Another dissimilarity between the two is that the IWeS-dis algorithm is defined for the batch streaming setting while the IWeS-dis algorithm and its analysis is developed for the streaming setting. Said differently, the IWeS-V algorithm can be seen as a special case of the IWeS-dis algorithm with target subset size of 1. To extend the theoretical guarantees of IWeS-V to the batch streaming setting, we can follow a similar analysis developed by Amin et al. (2020) to also find that the effects of delayed feedback in the batch streaming setting are in fact mild as compared to the streaming setting. 4.1 GENERALIZATION BOUND: Next, we turn to the topic of generalization guarantees and we review an existing bound for coreset based algorithms. The guarantees of coreset algorithms are generally focused on showing that a model\u2019s training loss on the selected subset is close to the same model\u2019s training loss on the whole dataset. That is, given dataset P = {(xi, yi)}Ti=1 \u223c DT , the learner seek to select a subset m < T of examples S = {(x\u2032i, y\u2032i)}mi=1 along with a corresponding set of weights w1, . . . , wm such that for some small > 0 and for all h \u2208 H, the additive error coreset guarantee holds\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2211mi=1 wi`(h(x\u2032i), y\u2032i)\u2212\u2211Ti=1 `(h(xi), yi)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 T . The following proposition, which is a minor extension of Fact 8 of Karnin & Liberty (2019), allows us to convert a coreset guarantee into a generalization guarantee. Proposition 4.1. Let h\u2032 = argminh\u2208H \u2211m i=1 wi`(h(x \u2032 i), y \u2032 i), and let the additive error coreset guarantee hold for any > 0, then for any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, it holds that L(h\u2032) \u2264 L(h\u2217) + 2 + 2 \u221a ln(4/\u03b4)/2T . As shown above, the generalization guarantee depends linearly on which in turn depends on the size of the subsetm. To give a few examples, Karnin & Liberty (2019) show that for hypotheses that are defined as analytic functions of dot products (e.g. generalized linear models) this dependence on m is = O(1/m), while for more complex Kernel Density Estimator type models the dependence is = O(1/ \u221a m). See Mai et al. (2021), Table 1, for examples on the dependency between and m under different data distributions assumptions (e.g. uniform, deterministic, `1 Lewis) and for specific loss functions (e.g. log loss, hinge loss). We now provide a generalization guarantee for the IWeS-V algorithm, which depends on the size of the labeled pool size T . The proof follows from that in Beygelzimer et al. (2009). Theorem 4.2. Let h\u2217 \u2208 H be the minimizer of the expected loss function h\u2217 = argminh\u2208H L(h). For any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, for any t \u2265 1 with t \u2208 {1, 2 . . . , T}, we have that h\u2217 \u2208 Ht and that L(f) \u2212 L(g) \u2264 2\u2206t\u22121 for any f, g \u2208 Ht. In particular, if hT is the output of IWeS-V, then L(hT )\u2212 L(h\u2217) \u2264 2\u2206T\u22121 = O (\u221a log(T/\u03b4)/T ) . Unlike the distribution-specific and loss-specific theoretical guarantees proposed in the coreset literature, Theorem 4.2 holds for any bounded loss function and general hypothesis classes. If we ignore log terms and consider the more complex Kernel Density Estimator class of hypotheses, the coreset method of Karnin & Liberty (2019) requires m = O(T ) coreset samples in order to achieve an overall O(1/ \u221a T ) generalization bound. As we will see in the next section, the required IWeS sampling rate can also be as high as O(T ), but critically is scaled by the best-in-class loss, which in favorable cases is significantly smaller than one. 4.2 SAMPLING RATE BOUNDS: Hanneke (2007) proves that the expected number of labeled examples needed to train a model in an active learning setting can be characterized in terms of the disagreement coefficient of the learning problem. Later, Beygelzimer et al. (2009) generalizes this notion to arbitrary loss functions, and in this work, we further generalize this for the subset selection setting. Recall that the disagreement coefficient \u03b8AL in Beygelzimer et al. (2009) for the active learning setting is defined as \u03b8AL = sup r\u22650 Ex\u223cX [ maxh\u2208BAL(h\u2217,r) maxy\u2208Y |`(h(x), y)\u2212 `(h\u2217(x), y)| ] r where BAL(h\u2217, r) = {h \u2208 H : \u03c1AL(h, h\u2217) \u2264 r} with \u03c1AL(f, g) = Ex\u223cX [supy\u2208Y |`(f(x), y) \u2212 `(g(x), y)|]. Informally, this coefficient quantifies how much disagreement there is among a set of classifiers that is close to the best-in-class hypothesis. In the subset selection setting, labels are available at sample time and, thus, we are able to define the following disagreement coefficient: Definition 4.1. Let \u03c1S(f, g) = E(x,y)\u2208D[|`(f(x), y) \u2212 `(g(x), y)|] and BS(h\u2217, r) = {h \u2208 H : \u03c1S(h, h \u2217) \u2264 r} for r \u2265 0. The disagreement coefficient in the subset selection setting is defined as \u03b8S = sup r\u22650 E(x,y)\u223cD [ maxh\u2208BS(h\u2217,r) |`(h(x), y)\u2212 `(h\u2217(x), y)| ] r . The main difference between the above coefficient and that of Beygelzimer et al. (2009) is that there is no supremum over all label y \u2208 Y both in the definition of the distance \u03c1 and the coefficient\u2019s numerator. Instead, the supremum is replaced with an expectation over the label space. The following theorem leverages \u03b8S to derive an upper bound on the expected number of selected examples for the IWeS-V algorithm. Below, let Ft = {(xi, yi, Qi)}ti=1 be the observations of the algorithm up to time t. Theorem 4.3. For any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the expected sampling rate of the IWeS-V algorithm is: \u2211T t=1 E(xt,yt)\u223cD [ pt \u2223\u2223Ft\u22121] = O(\u03b8S (L(h\u2217)T +\u221aT log(T/\u03b4))). Suppressing lower order terms, the above expected sampling rate bound is small whenever the product of the disagreement coefficient and the expected loss of the best-in-class is small. In such cases, by combining the above theorem with the generalization guarantee, it holds that IWeS-V returns a hypothesis trained on a only fraction of the points that generalizes as well as a hypothesis trained on the full dataset of size T . Theorem 4.3 can be further improved by adapting the ideas found in Cortes et al. (2019) to the IWeS-V algorithm. See Appendix B.4 for this enhanced analysis. The form of this sampling rate bound is similar to that of Beygelzimer et al. (2009). More concretely, under the assumption that a loss function has bounded slope asymmetry, that is K` = supz,z\u2032\u2208Z maxy\u2208Y |`(z,y)\u2212`(z\u2032,y)| miny\u2208Y |`(z,y)\u2212`(z\u2032,y)| is bounded, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the expected number of examples selected by the IWAL algorithm is given by O ( \u03b8ALK` ( L(h\u2217)T + \u221a T log(T/\u03b4) )) . Thus, the main difference between the sampling rate bound of the IWAL algorithm and the IWeS-V algorithm are the factors that depends on the two disagreement coefficients: \u03b8ALK` and \u03b8S. Since \u03b8S leverages the label information we may expect it to provide a tighter bound, compared to using the label-independent disagreement \u03b8AL. Theorem 4.4 shows that this is indeed the case. Theorem 4.4. If the loss function has a bounded slope asymmetry K`, then \u03b8S \u2264 \u03b8ALK`. The above theorem in conjunction with the sampling rate guarantees thus proves that the sampling rate bound of IWeS of Theorem 4.3 is tighter than the sampling rate bound of the IWAL algorithm. 5 CONCLUSION: In this paper we have introduced a subset selection algorithm, IWeS that is designed for arbitrary hypothesis classes including deep networks. We have shown that the IWeS algorithm outperforms several natural and important baselines across multiple datasets. In addition, we have developed an initial theoretical motivation for our approach based on the importance weighted sampling mechanism. A natural next step is enforcing a notion of diversity as it will likely provide improved performance in the large-batch sampling setting and thus, we plan to adapt the diversity-based method in Citovsky et al.

The paper title is: Leveraging Importance Weights in Subset Selection\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in several domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. In many tasks, this is achieved by heavily relying on extremely large labeled datasets. In addition to the storage costs and potential security/privacy concerns that come along with large datasets, training modern deep neural networks on such datasets also incur high computational costs. With the growing size of datasets in various domains, algorithm scalability is a real and imminent challenge that needs to be addressed. One promising way to solve this problem is with data subset selection, where the learner aims to find the most informative subset from a large number of training samples to approximate (or even improve upon) training with the entire training set. Such ideas have been extensively studied in k-means and k-median clustering (Har-Peled & Mazumdar, 2004), subspace approximation (Feldman et al., 2010), computational geometry (Agarwal et al., 2005), density estimation (Turner et al., 2021), to name a few. One particular approach for solving data subsampling involves the computation of coresets, which are weighted subsets of a dataset that can act as the proxy for the whole dataset to solve some optimization task. Coreset algorithms are primarily motivated with theoretical guarantees that bound the difference between the training loss (or other such objective) over the coreset and that over the full dataset under different assumptions on the losses and hypothesis classes (Mai et al., 2021; Munteanu et al., 2018; Curtin et al., 2019; Karnin & Liberty, 2019). However, in practice, most competitive subset selection algorithms, that are designed for general loss functions and arbitrary function classes, focus only on selecting informative subsets of the data and typically do not assign weights to the selected examples. These methods are, for example, based on some notion of model uncertainty (Scheffer et al., 2001), information gain (Argamon-Engelson & Dagan, 1999), loss gradients (Paul et al., 2021; Ash et al., 2019), or diversity (Sener & Savarese, 2017). Counter to this trend, we show that weighting the selected samples can be very beneficial. In this work, we present a subset selection algorithm called IWeS that is designed for general loss functions and hypothesis classes and that selects examples by importance sampling, a theoretically motivated and unbiased sampling technique. Importance sampling is conducted according to a specially crafted probability distribution and, importantly, each sampled example is weighted inversely proportional to its sampling probability when computing the training loss. We develop two types of sampling probability for different practical requirements (e.g. computational constraints and label availability), but in both cases, the sampling probability is based on the example\u2019s entropy-based score computed using a previously trained model. We note, the IWeS algorithm is similar to the IWAL active learning algorithm of Beygelzimer et al. (2009) as both are based on importance sampling. However, in contrast to IWAL, IWeS uses a different sampling probability definition with a focus on providing a practical method that is amenable to large deep networks and complex hypothesis classes. Through extensive experiments, we find that the IWeS algorithm is competitive for deep neural networks over several datasets. We compare our algorithm against four types of baselines whose sampling strategies leverage: the model\u2019s uncertainty over examples, diversity of selected examples, gradient information, and random sampling. Finally, we analyze a closely related albeit less practical algorithm that inspires the design of IWeS, called IWeS-V, proving it admits generalization and sampling rate guarantees that hold for general loss functions and hypothesis classes. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 1. We present the Importance Weighted Subset Selection (IWeS) algorithm that selects examples by importance sampling with a sampling probability based on a model\u2019s entropy, which is applicable to (and practical for) arbitrary model families including modern deep networks. In addition to the subset selection framework, IWeS also works in the active learning setting where the examples are unlabeled at selection time. 2. We demonstrate that IWeS achieves significant improvement over several baselines (Random, Margin, Least-Confident, Entropy, Coreset, BADGE) using VGG16 model for six common multi-class datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10-corrupted, CIFAR100, SVHN, Eurosat, Fashion MNIST), and using ResNet101 model for the large-scale multi-label OpenImages dataset. 3. We provide a theoretical analysis for a closely related algorithm, IWeS-V, in Section 4. We prove a O(1/ \u221a T ) generalization bound, which depends on the full training dataset size T . We further give a new definition of disagreement coefficient and prove a sampling rate bound by leveraging label information, which is tighter compared with the label complexity bound provided by Beygelzimer et al. (2009) that does not use label information. 1.1 RELATED WORK: Uncertainty. Uncertainty sampling, which selects examples that the model is least confident on, is favored by practitioners (Mussmann & Liang, 2018) and rather competitive among many recent algorithms (Yang & Loog, 2018). Uncertainty can be measured through entropy (Argamon-Engelson & Dagan, 1999), least confidence (Culotta & McCallum, 2005), and most popular is the margin between the most likely and the second most likely labels (Scheffer et al., 2001). Beygelzimer et al. (2009) makes use of a disagreement-based notion of uncertainty and constructs an importance weighted predictor with theoretical guarantees called IWAL, which is further enhanced by Cortes et al. (2019). However, IWAL is not directly suitable for use with complex hypothesis spaces, such as deep networks, since it requires solving a non-trivial optimization over a subset of the hypothesis class, the so-called version space, in order to compute sampling probabilities. We further discuss these difficulties in Section 4. Diversity. In another line of research, subsets are selected by enforcing diversity such as in the FASS (Wei et al., 2015) and Coreset (Sener & Savarese, 2017) algorithms. Wei et al. (2015) introduces a submodular sampling objective that trades off between uncertainty and diversity by finding a diverse set of samples from amongst those that the current trained model is most uncertain about. It was further explored by Kaushal et al. (2019) who designed a unified framework for data subset selection with facility location and dispersion-based diversity functions. Sener & Savarese (2017) show that the task of identifying a coreset in an active learning setting can be mapped to solving the k-center problem. Further recent works related to coreset idea are Mirzasoleiman et al. (2020); Killamsetty et al. (2021), where the algorithms select representative subsets of the training data to minimize the estimation error between the weighted gradient of selected subset and the full gradient. Loss Gradient. Another class of algorithms selects a subset by leveraging the loss gradients. For example, the GRAND score (Paul et al., 2021), or closely related EL2N score, leverages the average gradient across several different independent models to measure the importance of each sample. However, as such, it requires training several neural networks, which is computationally expensive. BADGE (Ash et al., 2019) is a sampling strategy for deep neural networks that uses k-MEANS++ on the gradient embedding of the networks to balance between uncertainty and diversity. Finally, for Algorithm 1 Importance Weighted Subset Selection (IWeS) Require: Labeled pool P , seed set size k0, subset batch size k, number of iterations R, weight cap parameter u. 1: Initialize the subset S = \u2205. 2: S0 \u2190 Draw k0 examples from P uniformly at random. 3: Set S = {(x, y, 1) : (x, y) \u2208 S0} and P = P\\S0 4: for r = 1, 2, . . . , R do 5: Set Sr = \u2205. 6: Train fr, gr on S using the weighted loss and independent random initializations. 7: while |Sr| < k do 8: Select (x, y) uniformly at random from P . 9: Set p(x, y) using entropy-based disagreement or entropy criteria shown in Eq (1) and (2). 10: Q \u223c Bernoulli(p(x, y)). 11: if Q = 1 then 12: Set Sr = Sr \u222a {( x, y,min ( 1 p(x,y) , u ))} and P = P\\ {(x, y)}. 13: end if 14: end while 15: S = S \u222a Sr. 16: end for 17: Train fR+1 on S using the weighted loss. 18: return S, fR+1 the sake of completeness, we note that importance weighting type approaches have also been used for the selection of examples within an SGD minibatch (Katharopoulos & Fleuret, 2018; Johnson & Guestrin, 2018), which can be thought of a change to the training procedure itself. In contrast, the problem setting we consider in this work requires explicitly producing a (weighted) subset of the training data and treats the training procedure itself as a black-box. These are a sampling of data subset selection algorithms, and we refer the reader to (Guo et al., 2022) for a more detailed survey. In this work, we choose at least one algorithm from each of the categories mentioned above, in particular, Margin (Scheffer et al., 2001), BADGE (Ash et al., 2019), and Coreset (Sener & Savarese, 2017) to compare against empirically in Section 3. However, before that, we first formally define the IWeS algorithm in the following section. 2 THE IWES ALGORITHM: We consider a practical batch streaming setting, where an algorithm processes one example at a time without updating its state until a batch of examples is selected. That is, like in standard streaming settings, the algorithm receives a labeled example, and decides whether to include it in the selected subset or not. Yet, the algorithm is only allowed to update its state after a fixed batch of examples have been selected in order to limit the overhead costs (e.g. this typically can include retraining models and extracting gradients). Unlike the pool-based setting where the algorithm receives the entire labeled pool beforehand, a batch streaming setting can be more appropriate when facing a vast training data pool since the algorithm can only process a subset of the pool without iterating over the whole pool. Note that any batch streaming algorithm can also be used in a pool-based setting, by simply streaming through the pool in a uniformly random fashion. At a high level, the IWeS algorithm selects examples by importance sampling where the sampling probability is based on the entropy of models trained on previously selected data. We define two sampling probabilities that allow us to trade-off between performance and the computational cost, as well as label-aware or an active learning setting leading to less label annotation costs. As we will subsequently see, these sampling definitions are both easy to use and work well in practice. To define the algorithm in more detail, we let X \u2208 Rd and Y = {1, . . . , c} denote the input space and the multi-class label space, respectively. We assume the data (x, y) is drawn from an unknown joint distributionD onX\u00d7Y . LetH = {h : X \u2192 Z} be the hypothesis class consisting of functions mapping from X to some prediction space Z \u2282 RY and let ` : Z \u00d7 Y \u2192 R denote the loss. The pseudocode of IWeS is shown in Algorithm 1. Initially, a seed set S0 (|S0| = k0) is selected uniformly at random from the labeled pool P . Then the algorithm proceeds in rounds r \u2208 [1, . . . , R] and it consists of two main components: training and sampling. At the training step at round r, the model(s) are trained using the importance-weighted loss, namely fr = arg minh\u2208H \u2211 (x,y,w)\u2208S w \u00b7 `(h(x), y) on the subset S, selected so far, in the previous r\u2212 1 rounds. Depending on the sampling strategy, we may need to randomly initialize two models fr, gr in which case they are trained independently on the same selected subset S, but with different random initializations. At the sampling step at round r, the IWeS algorithm calculates a sampling probably for example (x, y) \u2208 S based on one of the following definitions: \u2022 Entropy-based Disagreement. We define the sampling probability based on the disagreement on two functions with respect to entropy restricted to the labeled example (x, y). That is, p(x, y) = |Pfr (y|x) log Pfr (y|x)\u2212 Pgr (y|x) log Pgr (y|x)| (1) where Pfr (y|x) is the probability of class y with model fr given example x. If the two functions, fr, gr, disagree on the labeled example (x, y), then p(x, y) will be small and the example will be less likely to be selected. This definition is the closest to the IWeS-V algorithm analyzed in Section 4 and achieves the best performance when the computational cost of training two models is not an issue. In Appendix A, we show an efficient version of entropy-based disagreement that utilizes only one model and achieves similar performance. \u2022 Entropy. We define the sampling probability by the normalized entropy of the model fr trained on past selected examples: p(x, \u00b7) = \u2212 \u2211 y\u2032\u2208Y Pfr (y \u2032|x) log2 Pfr (y\u2032|x)/ log2 |Y|. (2) The sampling probability p(x, \u00b7) is high whenever the model class probability Pfr (y\u2032|x) is close to 1/|Y|, which is when the model is not confident about its prediction as it effectively randomly selects a label from Y . This definition does not use the label y and thus it can be used in an active learning setting where the algorithm can only access the unlabeled examples. Another advantage is that it only requires training one model, thereby saving some computational cost. We note that entropy-based sampling has been used in algorithms such as uncertainty sampling as discussed in the related works section, but using entropy to define importance weights has not been done in past literature. Based on one of these definitions, the IWeS algorithm then decides whether to include the example into the selected subset S by flipping a coin Q with chosen sampling probability p(x, y). If the example is selected, the example\u2019s corresponding weightw is set to 1p(x,y) , and the example is removed from the labeled pool P = P\\ {(x, y)}. This process is repeated until k examples have been selected. Below we use IWeS-dis as an abbreviation for IWeS algorithm with Entropy-based Disagreement sampling probability and IWeS-ent for IWeS algorithm with Entropy sampling probability. The weighted loss used to train the model can be written as 1|P| \u2211 i\u2208P Qi p(xi,yi) `(f(xi), yi) and it is an unbiased estimator of the population risk E(x,y)\u223cD[`(f(x), y)]. Yet such estimator can have a large variance when the model is highly confident in its prediction, that is whenever Pfr (y|x) is large, then p(x, y) is small. This may lead to training instability and one pragmatic approach to addressing this issue is by \u201cclipping\u201d the importance sampling weights (Ionides, 2008; Swaminathan & Joachims, 2015). Thus in our algorithm, we let u be the upper bound on the weight of the selected example. Although this clipping strategy introduces an additional parameter, we find it is not too sensitive and, as mentioned in the empirical section, set it to a fixed constant throughout our evaluation. 3 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION: We compare IWeS with state-of-the-art baselines on several image classification benchmarks. Specifically, we consider six multi-class datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), EUROSAT (Helber et al., 2019), CIFAR10 Corrupted (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), Fashion MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017) and one large-scale multi-label Open Images dataset (Krasin et al., 2017). In the multi-class setting, each image is associated with only one label. On the other hand, the multi-label Open Images dataset consists of 19,957 classes over 9M images, where each image contains binary labels for a small subset of the classes (on average 6 labels per image). Further details of each dataset can be found in Table 1 and Table 2 in the appendix. For all experiments, we consider a diverse set of standard baselines from both subset selection and active learning literature (discussed in Section 1.1). \u2022 Uncertainty Sampling selects top k examples on which the current model admits the highest uncertainty. There are three popular ways of defining model uncertainty s(x) of an example x, namely margin sampling, entropy sampling, and least confident sampling, and all are based on Pf [y\u0302|x], the probability of class y\u0302 given example x according to the model f . Margin sampling defines the model uncertainty of an example x as s(x) = 1 \u2212 (Pf [y\u03021|x] \u2212 Pf [y\u03022|x]) where y\u03021 = argmaxy\u2208Y Pf [y|x], y\u03022 = argmaxy\u2208Y\\y1 Pf [y|x] are the first and second most probable classes for model f . For entropy sampling, model uncertainty is defined as s(x) = \u2212 \u2211 y\u2208Y Pf (y\u0302|x) log(Pf (y\u0302|x)) while for least confidence sampling, it is defined as s(x) = 1\u2212maxy\u2208Y Pf (y\u0302|x). \u2022 BADGE of Ash et al. (2019) selects k examples by using the k-MEANS++ seeding algorithm using the gradient vectors, computed with respect to the penultimate layer using the most likely labels given by the latest model checkpoint. \u2022 Coreset (k-Center) of Sener & Savarese (2017) selects a subset of examples using their embeddings derived from the penultimate layer using the latest model checkpoint. In particular, the k examples are chosen using a greedy 2-approximation algorithm for the k-center problem. \u2022 Random Sampling selects k examples uniformly at random. 3.1 MULTI-CLASS EXPERIMENTS: Here, we compare the IWeS algorithm against the baselines on the six multi-class image datasets. We use the VGG16 architecture with weights that were pre-trained using ImageNet as well as add two fully-connected 4096 dimensional layers and a final prediction layer. Xavier uniform initialization is used for the final layers. For each dataset, we tune the learning rate by choosing the rate from the set {0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.1} that achieves best model performance on the seed set. We use batch SGD with the selected learning rate and fix SGD\u2019s batch size to 100. At each sampling round r, the model is trained to convergence on all past selected examples. For IWeS, we set the weight capping parameter to 2 for all datasets except for CIFAR10 which we decreased to 1.5 in order to reduce training instability. The embedding layer for BADGE and Coreset is extracted from the penultimate layer having a dimension of 4096. The effective dimension of the gradient vector in BADGE grows with the number of labels, which is problematic for CIFAR100 as it has 100 classes. More specifically, the runtime of BADGE is given by O (dkT ), which can be large for CIFAR100 since the dimension of the gradient vector from the penultimate layer is d = 4096 \u00d7 100, the size of the labeled pool is T=50K, and the number of examples selected in each round is k=5K. In order to solve this inefficiency for CIFAR100, we split the labeled pool randomly into 100 partitions and ran separate instances of the algorithm in each partition with batch size k/100. Each algorithm is initialized with an initial seed set that is sampled uniformly at random from the pool. After that, sampling then proceeds in a series of rounds r where the model is frozen until a batch k of examples is selected. The seed set size and sampling batch size k are set to 1K for CIFAR10, SVHN, EUROSAT, CIFAR10 Corrupted, Fashion MNIST, and to 5K for CIFAR100. The experiment was repeated for 5 trials. Any trial that encountered divergent training, i.e. the resulting model accuracy is more than three times below the standard error of model\u2019s accuracy on seed set, was dropped. We note that this happened infrequently (less than 3% of the time) and all reported averaged results have at least 3 trials. Figure 1 shows the mean and standard error of VGG16 model\u2019s accuracy on a held out test set comparing IWeS-dis to the baseline methods. The IWeS-dis algorithm either outperforms or matches the performance of the baseline algorithms for all datasets. We also find that margin sampling consistently performs well against the remaining baseline algorithms and that BADGE either matches the performance of margin sampling or slightly underperforms on some datasets (Eurosat, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR100). Coreset admits a similar and at times slightly poorer performance compared to random sampling. Next, Figure 2 compares the two variants of our algorithm: IWeS-dis and IWeS-ent. We find that the IWeS-dis performs slightly better than IWeS-ent on most of the datasets. This is not surprising since the IWeS-dis sampling probability leverages label information and more computational power, i.e. trains two models. As explained in Section 4, it also better fits our theoretical motivation. Nevertheless, it is important to note that IWeS-ent, without the label information, still consistently outperforms or matches the performance of the baselines for all the datasets. 3.2 MULTI-LABEL OPEN IMAGES EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we evaluate the performance of the IWeS algorithm on Open Images v6. We train a ResNet101 model on 64 Cloud two core TPU v4 acceleration, and apply batch SGD with batchsize of 6144 and an initial learning rate of 10\u22124 with decay logarithmically every 5\u00d7 108 examples. We add a global pooling layer with a fully connected layer of 128 dimensions as the final layers of the networks, which is needed by BADGE and Coreset baselines. The model is initialized with weights that were pre-trained on the validation split using 150K SGD steps, and at each sampling round, the model is trained on all past selected examples with an additional 15K SGD steps. In the previous section, our results show that the IWeS-dis algorithm only slightly outperforms the IWeS-ent algorithm on a few datasets. Additionally, since the IWeS-dis requires training two neural networks, which is computationally expensive in this scenario, we only test the performance of IWeS-ent. Since IWeS-ent doesn\u2019t use the label information, this also allows us to measure the performance of the algorithm in an active learning setting. Since Open Images is a multi-label dataset, the sampling algorithms must not only select the image, but also the class. That is, each example selected by an algorithm consists of an image-class pair with a corresponding binary label indicating whether the corresponding class is present in the image or not. In order to adapt IWeS-ent to the multi-label setting, the entropy sampling probability for each image-class pair is defined as p(x, \u00b7) = \u2212Pfr (y|x) log2 Pfr (y|x) \u2212 (1\u2212 Pfr (y|x)) log2 (1\u2212 Pfr (y|x)), where Pfr (y|x) is the model class probability of a positive label at round r. A seed set of size 300K is sampled uniformly at random from the pool, and at each sampling round r, the algorithms select 100K examples. Similarly to the previous section, in order to run BADGE on Open Images, we divide the pool into 100 partitions and run separate instances of the algorithm in each partition. For IWeS, the weight capping parameter is set to 10. Figure 3 shows the mean and standard error across 5 trials of the pooled average precision (Pooled AP) metric for each algorithm. As the number of selected examples increases, IWeS-ent outperforms all other baselines methods on the Open Images dataset. We also find that BADGE performs similarly or even slightly worse than the uncertainty-based sampling algorithms when the number of selected examples is smaller than 800K, and then outperforms all uncertainty-based sampling as the number of selected examples increases. Coreset initially performs better than random sampling, but at later sampling rounds, it admits a similar performance to random sampling. 4 THEORETICAL MOTIVATION: In order to theoretically motivate the IWeS algorithm, we analyze a closely related algorithm which we call IWeS-V, adapted from the IWAL algorithm of Beygelzimer et al. (2009). We prove that IWeS-V admits generalization bounds that scale with the dataset size T and sampling rate bounds that are in terms of a new disagreement coefficient tailored to the subset selection framework. Below, we let L(h) = E(x,y)\u223cD[`(h(x), y)] denote the expected loss of hypothesis h \u2208 H, and h\u2217 = argminh\u2208H L(h) be the best-in-class hypothesis. Without loss of generality, we consider a bounded loss ` : Z \u00d7 Y \u2192 [0, 1] mapping to the interval [0, 1]. Such a loss can be achieved by any bounded loss after normalization. For simplicity, we assume H is a finite set, but our results can be easily extended by standard covering arguments to more general hypothesis sets such as finite VC-classes. The IWeS-V algorithm operates on an i.i.d. example (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xT , yT ) drawn from D sequentially. It maintains a version spaceHt at any time t, withH1 = H. At time t, IWeS-V flips a coin Qt \u2208 {0, 1} with bias pt defined as pt = max f,g\u2208Ht `(f(xt), yt)\u2212 `(g(xt), yt) (3) whereHt = { h \u2208 Ht\u22121 : 1t \u2211t s=1 Qs ps `(h(xs), ys) \u2264 minh\u2032\u2208Ht\u22121 1t \u2211t s=1 Qs ps `(h\u2032(xs), ys) + \u2206t\u22121 } with \u2206t\u22121 = \u221a 8 log(2T (T+1)|H|2/\u03b4) t\u22121 . The example is selected if Qt = 1 and otherwise it is discarded. The main idea behind this algorithm is thus to define a sampling probability that is in terms of the disagreement between two hypothesis f, g that are not too far from the best model trained on the past selected data, i.e. minh\u2208Ht\u22121 1 t \u2211t s=1 Qs ps `(h(xs), ys). The formal IWeS-V algorithm pseudo-code (Algorithm 2) and all the theorem proofs can be found in Appendix B. In general, it is non-trivial to find two hypotheses f, g \u2208 Ht that maximize the expression in equation (3) and this main impracticality of IWeS-V is reason why we developed the IWeS algorithm of the previous section. This drawback is also shared by the IWAL algorithm of Beygelzimer et al. (2009), which computes a sampling probability very similar to that of equation (3), but with an additional maximization over the choice of y \u2208 Y in the definition of the sampling probability pt. Before continuing we explain how our practical algorithm IWeS-dis, specifically using sampling probability in equation (1), is closely related to the IWeS-V algorithm. Recall that the IWeS algorithm trains two models f and g each minimizing the importance-weighted loss using the data sampled so far. Therefore, each model exhibits reasonable training loss, i.e. they are expected to be included in the version space Ht of good hypothesis, while the different random initializations (in the case of non-convex neural network hypotheses) results in models that still differ in certain regions of the feature space. Thus, the difference in equation (1) can be thought of as a less aggressive version of the difference found in the maximization of equation (3). Another dissimilarity between the two is that the IWeS-dis algorithm is defined for the batch streaming setting while the IWeS-dis algorithm and its analysis is developed for the streaming setting. Said differently, the IWeS-V algorithm can be seen as a special case of the IWeS-dis algorithm with target subset size of 1. To extend the theoretical guarantees of IWeS-V to the batch streaming setting, we can follow a similar analysis developed by Amin et al. (2020) to also find that the effects of delayed feedback in the batch streaming setting are in fact mild as compared to the streaming setting. 4.1 GENERALIZATION BOUND: Next, we turn to the topic of generalization guarantees and we review an existing bound for coreset based algorithms. The guarantees of coreset algorithms are generally focused on showing that a model\u2019s training loss on the selected subset is close to the same model\u2019s training loss on the whole dataset. That is, given dataset P = {(xi, yi)}Ti=1 \u223c DT , the learner seek to select a subset m < T of examples S = {(x\u2032i, y\u2032i)}mi=1 along with a corresponding set of weights w1, . . . , wm such that for some small > 0 and for all h \u2208 H, the additive error coreset guarantee holds\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2211mi=1 wi`(h(x\u2032i), y\u2032i)\u2212\u2211Ti=1 `(h(xi), yi)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 T . The following proposition, which is a minor extension of Fact 8 of Karnin & Liberty (2019), allows us to convert a coreset guarantee into a generalization guarantee. Proposition 4.1. Let h\u2032 = argminh\u2208H \u2211m i=1 wi`(h(x \u2032 i), y \u2032 i), and let the additive error coreset guarantee hold for any > 0, then for any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, it holds that L(h\u2032) \u2264 L(h\u2217) + 2 + 2 \u221a ln(4/\u03b4)/2T . As shown above, the generalization guarantee depends linearly on which in turn depends on the size of the subsetm. To give a few examples, Karnin & Liberty (2019) show that for hypotheses that are defined as analytic functions of dot products (e.g. generalized linear models) this dependence on m is = O(1/m), while for more complex Kernel Density Estimator type models the dependence is = O(1/ \u221a m). See Mai et al. (2021), Table 1, for examples on the dependency between and m under different data distributions assumptions (e.g. uniform, deterministic, `1 Lewis) and for specific loss functions (e.g. log loss, hinge loss). We now provide a generalization guarantee for the IWeS-V algorithm, which depends on the size of the labeled pool size T . The proof follows from that in Beygelzimer et al. (2009). Theorem 4.2. Let h\u2217 \u2208 H be the minimizer of the expected loss function h\u2217 = argminh\u2208H L(h). For any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, for any t \u2265 1 with t \u2208 {1, 2 . . . , T}, we have that h\u2217 \u2208 Ht and that L(f) \u2212 L(g) \u2264 2\u2206t\u22121 for any f, g \u2208 Ht. In particular, if hT is the output of IWeS-V, then L(hT )\u2212 L(h\u2217) \u2264 2\u2206T\u22121 = O (\u221a log(T/\u03b4)/T ) . Unlike the distribution-specific and loss-specific theoretical guarantees proposed in the coreset literature, Theorem 4.2 holds for any bounded loss function and general hypothesis classes. If we ignore log terms and consider the more complex Kernel Density Estimator class of hypotheses, the coreset method of Karnin & Liberty (2019) requires m = O(T ) coreset samples in order to achieve an overall O(1/ \u221a T ) generalization bound. As we will see in the next section, the required IWeS sampling rate can also be as high as O(T ), but critically is scaled by the best-in-class loss, which in favorable cases is significantly smaller than one. 4.2 SAMPLING RATE BOUNDS: Hanneke (2007) proves that the expected number of labeled examples needed to train a model in an active learning setting can be characterized in terms of the disagreement coefficient of the learning problem. Later, Beygelzimer et al. (2009) generalizes this notion to arbitrary loss functions, and in this work, we further generalize this for the subset selection setting. Recall that the disagreement coefficient \u03b8AL in Beygelzimer et al. (2009) for the active learning setting is defined as \u03b8AL = sup r\u22650 Ex\u223cX [ maxh\u2208BAL(h\u2217,r) maxy\u2208Y |`(h(x), y)\u2212 `(h\u2217(x), y)| ] r where BAL(h\u2217, r) = {h \u2208 H : \u03c1AL(h, h\u2217) \u2264 r} with \u03c1AL(f, g) = Ex\u223cX [supy\u2208Y |`(f(x), y) \u2212 `(g(x), y)|]. Informally, this coefficient quantifies how much disagreement there is among a set of classifiers that is close to the best-in-class hypothesis. In the subset selection setting, labels are available at sample time and, thus, we are able to define the following disagreement coefficient: Definition 4.1. Let \u03c1S(f, g) = E(x,y)\u2208D[|`(f(x), y) \u2212 `(g(x), y)|] and BS(h\u2217, r) = {h \u2208 H : \u03c1S(h, h \u2217) \u2264 r} for r \u2265 0. The disagreement coefficient in the subset selection setting is defined as \u03b8S = sup r\u22650 E(x,y)\u223cD [ maxh\u2208BS(h\u2217,r) |`(h(x), y)\u2212 `(h\u2217(x), y)| ] r . The main difference between the above coefficient and that of Beygelzimer et al. (2009) is that there is no supremum over all label y \u2208 Y both in the definition of the distance \u03c1 and the coefficient\u2019s numerator. Instead, the supremum is replaced with an expectation over the label space. The following theorem leverages \u03b8S to derive an upper bound on the expected number of selected examples for the IWeS-V algorithm. Below, let Ft = {(xi, yi, Qi)}ti=1 be the observations of the algorithm up to time t. Theorem 4.3. For any \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the expected sampling rate of the IWeS-V algorithm is: \u2211T t=1 E(xt,yt)\u223cD [ pt \u2223\u2223Ft\u22121] = O(\u03b8S (L(h\u2217)T +\u221aT log(T/\u03b4))). Suppressing lower order terms, the above expected sampling rate bound is small whenever the product of the disagreement coefficient and the expected loss of the best-in-class is small. In such cases, by combining the above theorem with the generalization guarantee, it holds that IWeS-V returns a hypothesis trained on a only fraction of the points that generalizes as well as a hypothesis trained on the full dataset of size T . Theorem 4.3 can be further improved by adapting the ideas found in Cortes et al. (2019) to the IWeS-V algorithm. See Appendix B.4 for this enhanced analysis. The form of this sampling rate bound is similar to that of Beygelzimer et al. (2009). More concretely, under the assumption that a loss function has bounded slope asymmetry, that is K` = supz,z\u2032\u2208Z maxy\u2208Y |`(z,y)\u2212`(z\u2032,y)| miny\u2208Y |`(z,y)\u2212`(z\u2032,y)| is bounded, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the expected number of examples selected by the IWAL algorithm is given by O ( \u03b8ALK` ( L(h\u2217)T + \u221a T log(T/\u03b4) )) . Thus, the main difference between the sampling rate bound of the IWAL algorithm and the IWeS-V algorithm are the factors that depends on the two disagreement coefficients: \u03b8ALK` and \u03b8S. Since \u03b8S leverages the label information we may expect it to provide a tighter bound, compared to using the label-independent disagreement \u03b8AL. Theorem 4.4 shows that this is indeed the case. Theorem 4.4. If the loss function has a bounded slope asymmetry K`, then \u03b8S \u2264 \u03b8ALK`. The above theorem in conjunction with the sampling rate guarantees thus proves that the sampling rate bound of IWeS of Theorem 4.3 is tighter than the sampling rate bound of the IWAL algorithm. 5 CONCLUSION: In this paper we have introduced a subset selection algorithm, IWeS that is designed for arbitrary hypothesis classes including deep networks. We have shown that the IWeS algorithm outperforms several natural and important baselines across multiple datasets. In addition, we have developed an initial theoretical motivation for our approach based on the importance weighted sampling mechanism. A natural next step is enforcing a notion of diversity as it will likely provide improved performance in the large-batch sampling setting and thus, we plan to adapt the diversity-based method in Citovsky et al.

When calculating the fuzzy degree of membership of a sample within a specific class, traditional fuzzy rough sets give precedence to the distance information between the sample and other samples that do not belong to the class, often neglecting the influence of the remoteness of the sample from the specified class. In fact, this calculation strategy limits the discriminability of different samples relative to a given class, which may affect the accuracy and efficiency of feature subset selection. To address the shortcoming, the present study puts forward a new fuzzy rough set approach, weighted fuzzy rough set, which can more accurately measure the correlation and difference between samples relative to the decision class. Based on the distance from a sample to a class, the model first defines the importance of the sample to the class and uses it as a weight to measure the distance between the sample and other samples that do not belong to the class, thereby constructing a more effective fuzzy rough approximation operator. On this basis, a dependency measure between decision variables and conditional attributes is defined to evaluate the importance of candidate features. Then, a concept of discrimination between samples relative to a class is proposed, and the rationality of weighted fuzzy rough set is discussed. Finally, based on weighted fuzzy rough approximation operator, a new algorithm for selecting a subset of features is formulated.

This paper focuses on selecting features for medical data classification. Methods: In this work, a new form of ensemble FS method called weighted rank difference ensemble (WRD-Ensemble) has been put forth. It combines three FS methods to produce a stable and diverse subset of features. The three base FS approaches are Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC), reliefF, and gain ratio (GR). These three FS approaches produce three distinct lists of features, and then they order each feature by importance or weight. The final subset of features in this study is chosen using the average weight of each feature and the rank difference of a feature across three ranked lists. Using the average weight and rank difference of each feature, unstable and less significant features are eliminated from the feature space. The WRD-Ensemble method is applied to three medical datasets: chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer, and heart disease. These data samples are classified using logistic regression (LR). Results: The experimental results show that compared to the base FS methods and other ensemble FS methods, the proposed WRD-Ensemble method leads to obtaining the highest accuracy value of 98.97% for CKD, 93.24% for lung cancer, and 83.84% for heart disease.

When calculating the fuzzy degree of membership of a sample within a specific class, traditional fuzzy rough sets give precedence to the distance information between the sample and other samples that do not belong to the class, often neglecting the influence of the remoteness of the sample from the specified class. In fact, this calculation strategy limits the discriminability of different samples relative to a given class, which may affect the accuracy and efficiency of feature subset selection. To address the shortcoming, the present study puts forward a new fuzzy rough set approach, weighted fuzzy rough set, which can more accurately measure the correlation and difference between samples relative to the decision class. Based on the distance from a sample to a class, the model first defines the importance of the sample to the class and uses it as a weight to measure the distance between the sample and other samples that do not belong to the class, thereby constructing a more effective fuzzy rough approximation operator. On this basis, a dependency measure between decision variables and conditional attributes is defined to evaluate the importance of candidate features. Then, a concept of discrimination between samples relative to a class is proposed, and the rationality of weighted fuzzy rough set is discussed. Finally, based on weighted fuzzy rough approximation operator, a new algorithm for selecting a subset of features is formulated. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in terms of performance, not only selecting a smaller number of features, but also achieving higher classification accuracy for simplified data, showing its practical application value in feature selection.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4477c404b824d1731b2f134671f34ed844aa257f'}, {'title': 'Weighted Rank Difference Ensemble: A New Form of Ensemble Feature Selection Method for Medical Datasets', 'authors': ['Jos \u00e9 Machado', 'A.

This paper focuses on selecting features for medical data classification. Methods: In this work, a new form of ensemble FS method called weighted rank difference ensemble (WRD-Ensemble) has been put forth. It combines three FS methods to produce a stable and diverse subset of features. The three base FS approaches are Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC), reliefF, and gain ratio (GR). These three FS approaches produce three distinct lists of features, and then they order each feature by importance or weight. The final subset of features in this study is chosen using the average weight of each feature and the rank difference of a feature across three ranked lists. Using the average weight and rank difference of each feature, unstable and less significant features are eliminated from the feature space. The WRD-Ensemble method is applied to three medical datasets: chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer, and heart disease. These data samples are classified using logistic regression (LR). Results: The experimental results show that compared to the base FS methods and other ensemble FS methods, the proposed WRD-Ensemble method leads to obtaining the highest accuracy value of 98.97% for CKD, 93.24% for lung cancer, and 83.84% for heart disease.

Theoretical Motivation\\n\\nThis section assesses the \\\"why\\\" behind the paper's theoretical endeavor.\\n\\n1.  **Problem Formulation:**\\n    *   Is the core problem clearly defined? (e.g., analyzing generalization in a specific learning paradigm, determining minimum data requirements for a certain accuracy, understanding the impact of specific architectural choices).\\n    *   Are the assumptions made for the theoretical analysis explicitly stated and well-justified? (e.g., data distribution assumptions, model class properties, optimization algorithm characteristics).\\n    *   Is the objective of the theoretical analysis well-articulated? (e.g., bounding the excess risk, establishing convergence rates, quantifying sample complexity).\\n\\n2.  **Context and Related Work:**\\n    *   How does the paper position itself within the existing theoretical literature?\\n    *   What are the limitations of previous theoretical results that this paper aims to address? (e.g., previous bounds were too loose, required overly strong assumptions, didn't apply to the relevant setting).\\n    *   Does the paper sufficiently explain why its chosen theoretical setting or approach is necessary or advantageous? (e.g., addressing deep learning, specific non-convex optimization, unique data modalities).\\n\\n3.  **Key Challenges and Contributions:**\\n    *   What are the main theoretical hurdles the authors faced in deriving their results?\\n    *   What specific theoretical tools or techniques did they develop or adapt to overcome these challenges?\\n    *   Is the theoretical contribution truly novel, or is it an incremental improvement? (Both can be valuable, but clarity on this is important).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### III. Generalization Bounds\\n\\nThis section focuses on bounds that quantify the difference between empirical risk (training performance) and true risk (expected performance on unseen data).\\n\\n1.  **Type of Bound:**\\n    *   What type of generalization bound is derived? (e.g., PAC-style uniform convergence bounds, Rademacher complexity bounds, VC-dimension bounds, PAC-Bayesian bounds, stability-based bounds, information-theoretic bounds).\\n    *   What quantity is being bounded? (e.g., excess risk $R(h) - R^*$, generalization gap $R(h) - \\\\hat{R}(h)$).\\n\\n2.  **Dependencies and Tightness:**\\n    *   **Sample Size (N):** How does the bound scale with the number of training samples? Is it $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/\\\\sqrt{N})$, $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/N)$, or something else? Is this optimal for the given setting?\\n    *   **Model Complexity:** How does the bound depend on the complexity of the hypothesis class (e.g., VC-dimension, Rademacher complexity, number of parameters, norm bounds, depth/width for neural networks)?\\n    *   **Dimension (d):** How does the bound scale with the input/feature dimension? Is it independent of dimension (e.g., for certain kernel methods or high-dimensional settings), or does it suffer from the curse of dimensionality?\\n    *   **Problem Parameters:** Does it depend on noise levels (e.g., Tsybakov's noise condition, sub-Gaussian parameters), Lipschitz constants, smoothness parameters, or other problem-specific constants?\\n    *   **Confidence Parameter ($\\\\delta$):** How does the bound depend on the probability of failure ($\\\\delta$)? Typically $\\\\sqrt{\\\\log(1/\\\\delta)}$.\\n    *   **Tightness:** Is the derived bound tight? Are there known lower bounds that match the scaling? If not, what is the gap (e.g., logarithmic factors, polynomial factors)? How does it compare to the best known bounds for similar settings in the literature?\\n\\n3.  **Assumptions and Conditions:**\\n    *   What are the precise conditions under which the generalization bound holds? (e.g., boundedness of loss function, specific data distribution properties, convexity, strong convexity, smoothness, properties of the optimization algorithm).\\n    *   Are these assumptions realistic or restrictive? Do they align with the real-world applications the paper targets?\\n    *   Are there ways to relax these assumptions in future work or is it an inherent limitation?\\n\\n4.  **Interpretability and Insights:**\\n    *   What do the bounds tell us about the learning process? Do they explain observed empirical phenomena (e.g., why deep networks generalize well despite high capacity, the role of implicit regularization)?\\n    *   Do they provide practical guidance for model design, data collection, or algorithm selection?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### IV. Sampling Rate Bounds (Sample Complexity)\\n\\nThis section often overlaps with generalization but can also refer to specific rates for data acquisition (e.g., active learning), communication (e.g., distributed learning), or privacy (e.g., differentially private learning).\\n\\n1.  **Definition of \\\"Sampling Rate\\\":**\\n    *   Does it refer to the minimum number of samples required to achieve a certain accuracy (sample complexity)?\\n    *   Does it refer to the rate at which information is acquired or transmitted (e.g., in active learning, federated learning)?\\n    *   Does it refer to the rate at which privacy is preserved while maintaining utility?\\n\\n2.  **Context and Setting:**\\n    *   For sample complexity: Is it for classification, regression, specific optimization problems, etc.?\\n    *   For active learning: What kind of query model is assumed (e.g., label queries, membership queries)?\\n    *   For distributed/federated learning: What is being constrained (e.g., communication rounds, total bits transmitted, local computation)?\\n\\n3.  **Dependencies and Optimality:**\\n    *   **Accuracy ($\\\\epsilon$):** How does the required number of samples (or other resource) scale with the desired accuracy $\\\\epsilon$? (Typically $1/\\\\epsilon^2$ or $1/\\\\epsilon$). Is this optimal?\\n    *   **Confidence ($\\\\delta$):** How does it scale with the failure probability $\\\\delta$?\\n    *   **Problem/Model Parameters:** Similar to generalization bounds, how does it depend on dimension, complexity, noise levels, etc.?\\n    *   **Comparison to Lower Bounds:** Are there known information-theoretic lower bounds for the problem? Does the derived sampling rate match these lower bounds, indicating optimality? If not, what is the gap?\\n    *   **Comparison to Existing Algorithms:** How does the sampling rate compare to that of other known algorithms for the same task? Does it offer improvements?\\n\\n4.  **Practical Implications:**\\n    *   Does the derived sampling rate provide guidance on how much data/resource is truly needed for a specific task?\\n    *   Does it justify the use of certain data collection strategies or communication protocols?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### V. Validity of Proofs\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most critical section, assessing the mathematical rigor.\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Completeness:**\\n    *   Are all definitions, theorems, and lemmas clearly stated?\\n    *   Is the logical flow of the arguments easy to follow?\\n    *   Are all steps in the proofs justified? Are there any significant gaps or jumps that require \\\"filling in\\\"?\\n    *   Are all conditions and assumptions under which lemmas and theorems hold explicitly stated and adhered to?\\n\\n2.  **Mathematical Rigor:**\\n    *   Are the mathematical derivations correct? Are inequalities (e.g., Hoeffding, McDiarmid, Jensen, Cauchy-Schwarz) applied properly?\\n    *   Are probabilistic arguments sound? Is conditional independence/dependence handled correctly?\\n    *   Is the notation consistent throughout the proofs?\\n    *   Are edge cases or degenerate scenarios handled appropriately?\\n\\n3.  **Novelty of Proof Techniques:**\\n    *   Does the paper introduce genuinely new proof techniques or significantly adapt existing ones?\\n    *   If existing techniques are used, are they applied correctly and insightfully to the new problem?\\n\\n4.  **Potential Weak Points/Errors:**\\n    *   Are there any assumptions that appear to be implicitly made but not stated?\\n    *   Are there any steps that seem \\\"hand-wavy\\\" or rely on intuition rather than rigorous derivation?\\n    *   Are there any potential counter-examples to claims made in the proofs?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### VI. Significance of Theoretical Results\\n\\nThis section summarizes the overall impact and contribution.\\n\\n1.  **Theoretical Impact:**\\n    *   Does the paper push the boundary of theoretical understanding in machine learning?\\n    *   Does it provide new fundamental insights into why certain learning algorithms work or fail?\\n    *   Does it unify previously disparate theoretical results or frameworks?\\n    *   Does it identify new theoretical challenges or open new research directions?\\n\\n2.  **Practical Relevance:**\\n    *   Do the theoretical results have clear implications for practitioners? (e.g., informing hyperparameter tuning, guiding model selection, designing more efficient algorithms).\\n    *   Are the bounds too loose or based on assumptions that are too restrictive to be practically useful, or do they offer concrete, actionable insights?\\n    *   If applicable, how do the theoretical results relate to empirical observations or experimental results presented in the paper (if any)?\\n\\n3.  **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:**\\n    *   How do the derived bounds/rates compare to the best known results in the literature for similar problems?\\n    *   Are they strictly better (tighter, more general, fewer assumptions), or do they offer a different perspective?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### VII. Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\nThis section provides constructive feedback.\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Presentation:**\\n    *   Improve clarity of definitions, notation, or theorem statements.\\n    *   Restructure proofs for better readability (e.g., moving lengthy calculations to an appendix, providing more high-level intuition before detailed proofs).\\n    *   Add more illustrative examples or figures to clarify complex concepts.\\n\\n2.  **Strengthening Theoretical Results:**\\n    *   Can the bounds be further tightened? Are there specific avenues for improvement?\\n    *   Can assumptions be relaxed without losing the core results?\\n    *   Can the results be extended to more general settings (e.g., different loss functions, more complex model classes, online learning)?\\n    *   Investigate the tightness of the bounds by exploring matching lower bounds if not already done.\\n\\n3.  **Discussion and Context:**\\n    *   Provide more detailed discussion of the practical implications of the theoretical results.\\n    *   More thoroughly discuss limitations of the current theory and potential avenues for future research.\\n    *   Better connect the theoretical findings with empirical observations or existing practical knowledge.\\n\\n4.  **Minor Issues:**\\n    *   Identify any typos, grammatical errors, or inconsistencies in notation.\\n    *   Suggest improvements to the bibliography.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOnce you provide the paper, I can apply this framework to give you a specific and actionable review.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.84361525\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"TheoryExpert\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper, focusing on the theoretical motivation, generalization bounds, and sampling rate bounds.

While conceptually appealing and addressing a real problem of data redundancy and training cost, its practicality for large-scale deep learning is highly questionable due to significant computational overhead. Its novelty lies more in its specific combination and iterative application of existing concepts (gradient-based importance, iterative selection) rather than introducing fundamentally new ideas. It positions itself as a data reduction method distinct from traditional active learning (which focuses on labeling cost), but shares significant methodological overlap with various forms of curriculum learning, data distillation, and coreset selection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Paper Summary of IWeS\\n\\nThe paper introduces IWeS as a method to select a small, highly informative subset of a large dataset for more efficient model training. The core idea is to iteratively:\\n1.  Train a model on the currently selected subset of data.\\n2.  Compute an \\\"importance weight\\\" for *every* sample in the *entire original dataset* (or a large pool of candidate samples) based on its current utility or impact on the model. This importance is likely derived from the magnitude of its gradient with respect to the loss function, or some related metric indicating \\\"hardness\\\" or \\\"informativeness.\\\"\\n3.  Select the top-K samples with the highest importance weights to form the new training subset for the next iteration.\\n4.  Repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.\\n\\nThe objective is to achieve comparable model performance to training on the full dataset, but with significantly reduced training time and resources, by focusing only on the most impactful data points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Novelty of the IWeS Algorithm\\n\\nThe novelty of IWeS, as described, appears to be incremental rather than revolutionary.\\n\\n*   **Gradient-based Importance:** The concept of using gradients to gauge sample importance is well-established in machine learning. It forms the basis of:\\n    *   **Influence Functions:** Quantifying how much a training point influences a model's prediction on a test point (requires Hessian-vector products, often expensive).\\n    *   **Active Learning:** Many active learning strategies (e.g., gradient diversity, expected error reduction, uncertainty sampling) leverage gradient information or uncertainty related to a sample's contribution to model learning.\\n    *   **Curriculum Learning/Hard Example Mining:** Implicitly or explicitly, methods like Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) or Focal Loss prioritize samples with high loss or large gradients.\\n    *   **Data Valuation:** Quantifying the \\\"value\\\" of a data point, often using Shapley values or gradient-based approaches.\\n\\n*   **Iterative Subset Selection:** The idea of iteratively refining a training set is also not new.\\n    *   **Active Learning:** The entire paradigm is iterative selection.\\n    *   **Coreset Selection:** Many coreset algorithms iteratively build or refine a coreset.\\n    *   **Data Distillation:** While often synthesizing data, some approaches involve iterative pruning or selection.\\n\\n**Where IWeS *might* be novel:**\\nThe specific *combination* of these elements, particularly the iterative re-evaluation of *all candidate samples* for their importance at each step, and its primary stated goal of *training efficiency* on *already labeled data* (as opposed to reducing labeling cost in AL), could be framed as a novel application or refinement of existing techniques. If the paper introduces a *new and computationally efficient* way to compute these \\\"importance weights\\\" or a *novel selection strategy* that implicitly ensures diversity, that would significantly boost its novelty score. However, based solely on the description, it seems to be an intelligent fusion of known components.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Practicality of the IWeS Algorithm\\n\\nThe practicality of IWeS is a major concern, especially in the context of large-scale datasets and deep networks.\\n\\n**Strengths (Potential Practicality):**\\n*   **Intuitive:** The concept of training on the \\\"most important\\\" data points is easy to grasp and aligns with human learning intuition (focusing on challenging examples).\\n*   **Flexibility:** The \\\"importance weight\\\" function can potentially be customized based on the specific problem or model architecture (e.g., loss gradient magnitude, margin, prediction confidence, etc.).\\n*   **Targeted Use Cases:** Could be practical for smaller datasets, fine-tuning pre-trained models on slightly different domains, or where data redundancy is extremely high and the *initial computation cost* can be amortized over many training runs.\\n\\n**Weaknesses (Major Practicality Concerns):**\\n*   **Computational Cost (The \\\"Killer\\\" for Deep Learning):** The most significant bottleneck is step 2: \\\"Compute an 'importance weight' for *every* sample in the *entire original dataset*.\\\"\\n    *   For a dataset with $N$ samples (e.g., $N=10^6$ to $10^9$ for deep learning), this means performing a forward and backward pass for *each* of these $N$ samples *at every iteration*. If a model takes $T_{batch}$ time to process a batch, processing $N$ samples takes roughly $N / \\\\text{batch_size} \\\\times T_{batch}$. This often equates to multiple full epochs over the entire dataset.\\n    *   This cost is incurred *per iteration* of IWeS. If IWeS requires $M$ iterations, the total cost for importance calculation alone could be $M \\\\times (\\\\text{cost of one full epoch})$. This very quickly dwarfs the training time saved by using a smaller subset.\\n    *   **Example:** If training on full ImageNet (1.2M images) takes 10 hours, and IWeS has 5 iterations, the importance calculation might add 50 hours of overhead *before* even considering the training on the subset. This completely defeats the purpose of efficiency.\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Storing weights for $N$ samples might be an issue for very large $N$.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The algorithm introduces new hyperparameters:\\n    *   `K`: The size of the subset to select. How is this chosen? Too small, performance drops; too large, benefits diminish.\\n    *   `M`: The number of IWeS iterations. How many iterations are sufficient for convergence or optimal performance?\\n    *   The specific \\\"importance function\\\": Which gradient-based metric is best?\\n*   **Risk of Bias/Overfitting:** By continuously focusing on \\\"hard\\\" or \\\"high-gradient\\\" examples, the selected subset might become less diverse. This could lead to:\\n    *   Overfitting to noisy or adversarial examples.\\n    *   Poor generalization to \\\"easy\\\" but common examples necessary for a well-rounded model.\\n    *   Neglecting under-represented classes if their samples are consistently \\\"easy.\\\"\\n*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** Lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the optimality or convergence properties of the selected subset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Applicability to Deep Networks\\n\\nAs highlighted above, the applicability of IWeS to deep networks is severely limited by its computational demands.\\n\\n*   **Scalability Issue is Paramount:** Modern deep learning often involves datasets with millions or billions of samples. The proposed method of re-evaluating *all* samples at *each iteration* becomes prohibitively expensive. Even if done in mini-batches, the total number of gradient computations across the entire dataset multiple times is a non-starter for large N.\\n*   **Gradient Stability in Deep Networks:** Gradients in deep networks can be noisy, especially in early training stages or when models are poorly initialized. Relying solely on gradient magnitude for importance might be unstable or misleading. What if a sample has a high gradient because of a temporary local minimum, not true \\\"hardness\\\"?\\n*   **Generalization vs. Subset Size:** Deep networks often require vast amounts of diverse data to generalize well. A small subset, even if \\\"important,\\\" might not capture the full data distribution necessary for robust performance, especially on complex tasks like image recognition or NLP.\\n*   **Potential Niche:** IWeS *could* be more applicable in specific deep learning scenarios:\\n    *   **Transfer Learning/Fine-tuning:** If applied to a much smaller *target domain* dataset after pre-training on a massive dataset, the $N$ for importance calculation would be smaller.\\n    *   **Active Learning within Deep Learning:** If adapted to an active learning setting where the \\\"unlabeled pool\\\" is finite and manageable, and the goal is to pick the most informative samples to label from that pool.\\n    *   **Model Pruning/Distillation Data Selection:** For distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, selecting the most informative training data might be beneficial.\\n\\nFor training complex deep neural networks *from scratch* on massive datasets like ImageNet, OpenImages, or large text corpora, IWeS in its described form would likely be slower and more computationally intensive than simply training on the full dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Comparison to Existing Subset Selection and Active Learning Methods\\n\\nIWeS sits at the intersection of several related fields:\\n\\n*   **Data Distillation/Dataset Condensation:**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Both aim to reduce data for efficient training.\\n    *   **Differences:** Data distillation often *synthesizes* a small, artificial dataset that mimics the training dynamics of the original (e.g., Dataset Condensation, Data Efficient Learning). IWeS *selects* real samples. Data distillation can be computationally intensive at the \\\"synthesis\\\" stage but then offers extremely fast training with the distilled set. IWeS has ongoing computational cost.\\n    *   **Comparison:** IWeS is simpler to implement but likely less efficient for extreme data reduction than state-of-the-art data distillation.\\n\\n*   **Coreset Selection:**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Both aim to find a representative subset (coreset) that approximates the full dataset.\\n    *   **Differences:** Coresets often come with theoretical guarantees regarding approximation bounds (e.g., for k-means, PCA, logistic regression), and many rely on geometric properties (e.g., maximum diversity, farthest point sampling, coverage). IWeS is more heuristic and directly optimizes for model training utility via gradients.\\n    *   **Comparison:** Coreset methods are often more theoretically grounded but can be hard to adapt to general deep learning tasks. IWeS is more model-dependent.\\n\\n*   **Active Learning (AL):**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Iterative process, selects \\\"most informative\\\" samples, often uses uncertainty or gradient-based metrics.\\n    *   **Key Differences:**\\n        *   **Goal:** AL aims to *reduce labeling costs* by strategically selecting unlabeled data points to be manually labeled. IWeS assumes *all data is already labeled* and aims to *reduce training computation*.\\n        *   **Pool:** AL operates on an *unlabeled pool*. IWeS typically operates on a pool of *already labeled* candidate samples (which could be the entire original dataset).\\n        *   **Mechanism:** While both might use gradient info, AL queries from a distinct unlabeled set. IWeS *re-evaluates* samples from the full labeled set at each step.\\n    *   **Comparison:** IWeS could be seen as an active learning method applied to *training data selection from a pre-labeled pool* rather than querying for new labels. Many AL query strategies (e.g., uncertainty sampling, diversity sampling, query-by-committee, gradient-based sampling) could be adapted as \\\"importance functions\\\" for IWeS.\\n\\n*   **Curriculum Learning / Hard Example Mining:**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Both implicitly or explicitly prioritize \\\"harder\\\" or more impactful examples during training.\\n    *   **Differences:** Curriculum learning typically orders samples from easy to hard, or dynamically weights them. Hard Example Mining (like OHEM) selects hard examples *within a mini-batch* for loss computation. IWeS *selects a persistent subset* for *all* training iterations.\\n    *   **Comparison:** IWeS is a more explicit and global data selection strategy compared to per-batch mining or general curriculum ordering.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. Specific Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\nTo make IWeS more practical and impactful, especially for deep learning, the following suggestions should be considered:\\n\\n1.  **Address Scalability Directly and Explicitly:** This is the most critical point.\\n    *   **Approximate Importance Calculation:** Instead of computing weights for *all* $N$ samples, explore approximations:\\n        *   **Sampling:** Compute weights only for a randomly sampled subset of the *candidate pool* at each iteration.\\n        *   **Batch-wise Importance:** Can importance be estimated efficiently from mini-batches during a regular epoch? (e.g., average gradient norm per sample in batch, or per-sample loss gradient norm).\\n        *   **Low-Dimensional Projections:** Can we project data into a lower-dimensional space where importance can be estimated faster?\\n        *   **Early Exit for Easy Samples:** Can \\\"easy\\\" samples (consistently low loss/gradient) be effectively pruned from the candidate pool early on, reducing the number of samples to re-evaluate?\\n    *   **Computational Complexity Analysis:** Provide a clear breakdown of the computational cost (FLOPs, wall-clock time) of IWeS compared to full training and baselines, highlighting the $O(N)$ dependency per iteration.\\n    *   **Profiling:** Show real-world profiling data demonstrating the time spent on importance calculation vs. training.\\n\\n2.  **Richer Evaluation & Benchmarking:**\\n    *   **Large-Scale Deep Learning Benchmarks:** Evaluate on standard, large-scale deep learning datasets (e.g., ImageNet, large-scale NLP datasets) using complex deep neural networks (ResNets, Transformers). Small-scale experiments (e.g., CIFAR-10 with shallow CNNs) do not demonstrate scalability.\\n    *   **Stronger Baselines:** Compare against state-of-the-art methods in:\\n        *   **Coreset Selection:** Algorithms specifically designed for deep learning (e.g., Grad-Match, Data-Efficient Learning strategies).\\n        *   **Active Learning Adaptations:** Show how well an adapted active learning strategy (e.g., using uncertainty + diversity sampling on the entire labeled dataset for subset selection) performs.\\n        *   **Data Distillation/Condensation:** If relevant to the problem setting.\\n        *   **Simpler Heuristics:** E.g., uniform random sampling (as a baseline), random sampling proportional to class distribution, sampling based on initial loss.\\n    *   **Comprehensive Metrics:** Beyond just accuracy/F1, report:\\n        *   **Total Training Time:** Sum of all IWeS stages + subset training.\\n        *   **Memory Usage:** For importance scores and data handling.\\n        *   **Generalization Robustness:** How well does the model trained on the subset generalize to OOD data, adversarial examples, or minority classes?\\n        *   **Stability:** How sensitive is performance to random seeds, initialization, or specific importance functions?\\n\\n3.  **Ensure Diversity in Selection:**\\n    *   Simply picking the top-K \\\"most important\\\" samples can lead to redundancy if many similar samples are all \\\"hard.\\\"\\n    *   **Integrate Diversity:** Propose incorporating a diversity criterion into the selection process (e.g., using k-medoids on feature embeddings, determinantal point processes (DPPs), or clustering followed by selecting important samples from each cluster) alongside importance weighting. This is crucial for generalization.\\n\\n4.  **Ablation Studies and Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**\\n    *   Thoroughly investigate the impact of `K` (subset size) and `M` (number of iterations) on both performance and computational cost. Provide guidance on how to choose these.\\n    *   Ablate different \\\"importance functions\\\" (e.g., gradient norm, loss value, margin, uncertainty measures) to see which performs best under different conditions.\\n\\n5.  **Theoretical Insights:**\\n    *   While full theoretical guarantees might be challenging, provide some theoretical justification or intuition for *why* IWeS should work. E.g., under what assumptions does selecting high-gradient samples lead to a representative subset? How does the subset size K relate to approximation error?\\n\\n6.  **Clearly Define Ideal Use Cases:**\\n    *   Based on the analysis, articulate specific scenarios where IWeS would genuinely be beneficial (e.g., fine-tuning, domain adaptation with limited target data, specific resource-constrained environments). If it's not for training from scratch on massive datasets, be clear about it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nIWeS presents an interesting heuristic for data subset selection, leveraging intuitive concepts of sample importance. Its strength lies in its flexibility and potential to identify truly impactful data points. However, without substantial innovations in its scalability, particularly the cost of repeated full-dataset importance calculations, it faces significant hurdles for practical adoption in modern deep learning. Addressing these computational challenges and conducting rigorous, large-scale evaluations against strong, relevant baselines will be crucial for IWeS to demonstrate its value and move beyond a promising concept to a widely applicable technique.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.84161215\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper, focusing on the novelty and practicality of the IWeS algorithm, its applicability to deep networks, and its comparison to existing subset selection and active learning methods.

Generalization Bounds\\n\\nThis section focuses on bounds that quantify the difference between empirical risk (training performance) and true risk (expected performance on unseen data).\\n\\n1.  **Type of Bound:**\\n    *   What type of generalization bound is derived? (e.g., PAC-style uniform convergence bounds, Rademacher complexity bounds, VC-dimension bounds, PAC-Bayesian bounds, stability-based bounds, information-theoretic bounds).\\n    *   What quantity is being bounded? (e.g., excess risk $R(h) - R^*$, generalization gap $R(h) - \\\\hat{R}(h)$).\\n\\n2.  **Dependencies and Tightness:**\\n    *   **Sample Size (N):** How does the bound scale with the number of training samples? Is it $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/\\\\sqrt{N})$, $\\\\mathcal{O}(1/N)$, or something else? Is this optimal for the given setting?\\n    *   **Model Complexity:** How does the bound depend on the complexity of the hypothesis class (e.g., VC-dimension, Rademacher complexity, number of parameters, norm bounds, depth/width for neural networks)?\\n    *   **Dimension (d):** How does the bound scale with the input/feature dimension? Is it independent of dimension (e.g., for certain kernel methods or high-dimensional settings), or does it suffer from the curse of dimensionality?\\n    *   **Problem Parameters:** Does it depend on noise levels (e.g., Tsybakov\\'s noise condition, sub-Gaussian parameters), Lipschitz constants, smoothness parameters, or other problem-specific constants?\\n    *   **Confidence Parameter ($\\\\delta$):** How does the bound depend on the probability of failure ($\\\\delta$)? Typically $\\\\sqrt{\\\\log(1/\\\\delta)}$.\\n    *   **Tightness:** Is the derived bound tight? Are there known lower bounds that match the scaling? If not, what is the gap (e.g., logarithmic factors, polynomial factors)? How does it compare to the best known bounds for similar settings in the literature?\\n\\n3.  **Assumptions and Conditions:**\\n    *   What are the precise conditions under which the generalization bound holds? (e.g., boundedness of loss function, specific data distribution properties, convexity, strong convexity, smoothness, properties of the optimization algorithm).\\n    *   Are these assumptions realistic or restrictive? Do they align with the real-world applications the paper targets?\\n    *   Are there ways to relax these assumptions in future work or is it an inherent limitation?\\n\\n4.  **Interpretability and Insights:**\\n    *   What do the bounds tell us about the learning process?

Sampling Rate Bounds (Sample Complexity)\\n\\nThis section often overlaps with generalization but can also refer to specific rates for data acquisition (e.g., active learning), communication (e.g., distributed learning), or privacy (e.g., differentially private learning).\\n\\n1.  **Definition of \"Sampling Rate\":**\\n    *   Does it refer to the minimum number of samples required to achieve a certain accuracy (sample complexity)?\\n    *   Does it refer to the rate at which information is acquired or transmitted (e.g., in active learning, federated learning)?\\n    *   Does it refer to the rate at which privacy is preserved while maintaining utility?\\n\\n2.  **Context and Setting:**\\n    *   For sample complexity: Is it for classification, regression, specific optimization problems, etc.?\\n    *   For active learning: What kind of query model is assumed (e.g., label queries, membership queries)?\\n    *   For distributed/federated learning: What is being constrained (e.g., communication rounds, total bits transmitted, local computation)?\\n\\n3.  **Dependencies and Optimality:**\\n    *   **Accuracy ($\\\\epsilon$):** How does the required number of samples (or other resource) scale with the desired accuracy $\\\\epsilon$? (Typically $1/\\\\epsilon^2$ or $1/\\\\epsilon$). Is this optimal?\\n    *   **Confidence ($\\\\delta$):** How does it scale with the failure probability $\\\\delta$?\\n    *   **Problem/Model Parameters:** Similar to generalization bounds, how does it depend on dimension, complexity, noise levels, etc.?\\n    *   **Comparison to Lower Bounds:** Are there known information-theoretic lower bounds for the problem? Does the derived sampling rate match these lower bounds, indicating optimality? If not, what is the gap?\\n    *   **Comparison to Existing Algorithms:** How does the sampling rate compare to that of other known algorithms for the same task? Does it offer improvements?\\n\\n4.  **Practical Implications:**\\n    *   Does the derived sampling rate provide guidance on how much data/resource is truly needed for a specific task?\\n    *   Does it justify the use of certain data collection strategies or communication protocols?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### V. Validity of Proofs\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most critical section, assessing the mathematical rigor.\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Completeness:**\\n    *   Are all definitions, theorems, and lemmas clearly stated?\\n    *   Is the logical flow of the arguments easy to follow?\\n    *   Are all steps in the proofs justified? Are there any significant gaps or jumps that require \"filling in\"?\\n    *   Are all conditions and assumptions under which lemmas and theorems hold explicitly stated and adhered to?\\n\\n2.  **Mathematical Rigor:**\\n    *   Are the mathematical derivations correct? Are inequalities (e.g., Hoeffding, McDiarmid, Jensen, Cauchy-Schwarz) applied properly?\\n    *   Are probabilistic arguments sound? Is conditional independence/dependence handled correctly?\\n    *   Is the notation consistent throughout the proofs?\\n    *   Are edge cases or degenerate scenarios handled appropriately?\\n\\n3.  **Novelty of Proof Techniques:**\\n    *   Does the paper introduce genuinely new proof techniques or significantly adapt existing ones?\\n    *   If existing techniques are used, are they applied correctly and insightfully to the new problem?\\n\\n4.  **Potential Weak Points/Errors:**\\n    *   Are there any assumptions that appear to be implicitly made but not stated?\\n    *   Are there any steps that seem \"hand-wavy\" or rely on intuition rather than rigorous derivation?\\n    *   Are there any potential counter-examples to claims made in the proofs?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### VI. Significance of Theoretical Results\\n\\nThis section summarizes the overall impact and contribution.\\n\\n1.  **Theoretical Impact:**\\n    *   Does the paper push the boundary of theoretical understanding in machine learning?\\n    *   Does it provide new fundamental insights into why certain learning algorithms work or fail?\\n    *   Does it unify previously disparate theoretical results or frameworks?\\n    *   Does it identify new theoretical challenges or open new research directions?\\n\\n2.  **Practical Relevance:**\\n    *   Do the theoretical results have clear implications for practitioners? (e.g., informing hyperparameter tuning, guiding model selection, designing more efficient algorithms).\\n    *   Are the bounds too loose or based on assumptions that are too restrictive to be practically useful, or do they offer concrete, actionable insights?\\n    *   If applicable, how do the theoretical results relate to empirical observations or experimental results presented in the paper (if any)?\\n\\n3.  **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:**\\n    *   How do the derived bounds/rates compare to the best known results in the literature for similar problems?\\n    *   Are they strictly better (tighter, more general, fewer assumptions), or do they offer a different perspective?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### VII. Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\nThis section provides constructive feedback.\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Presentation:**\\n    *   Improve clarity of definitions, notation, or theorem statements.\\n    *   Restructure proofs for better readability (e.g., moving lengthy calculations to an appendix, providing more high-level intuition before detailed proofs).\\n    *   Add more illustrative examples or figures to clarify complex concepts.\\n\\n2.  **Strengthening Theoretical Results:**\\n    *   Can the bounds be further tightened? Are there specific avenues for improvement?\\n    *   Can assumptions be relaxed without losing the core results?\\n    *   Can the results be extended to more general settings (e.g., different loss functions, more complex model classes, online learning)?\\n    *   Investigate the tightness of the bounds by exploring matching lower bounds if not already done.\\n\\n3.  **Discussion and Context:**\\n    *   Provide more detailed discussion of the practical implications of the theoretical results.\\n    *   More thoroughly discuss limitations of the current theory and potential avenues for future research.\\n    *   Better connect the theoretical findings with empirical observations or existing practical knowledge.\\n\\n4.  **Minor Issues:**\\n    *   Identify any typos, grammatical errors, or inconsistencies in notation.\\n    *   Suggest improvements to the bibliography.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOnce you provide the paper, I can apply this framework to give you a specific and actionable review.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.84361525}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'To provide a detailed review of \"the paper\" focusing on experimental design, datasets used, baselines compared against, and the validity of the conclusions drawn from the empirical results, I need to *first* have access to the paper itself.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I cannot review a paper that has not been provided.

While conceptually appealing and addressing a real problem of data redundancy and training cost, its practicality for large-scale deep learning is highly questionable due to significant computational overhead. Its novelty lies more in its specific combination and iterative application of existing concepts (gradient-based importance, iterative selection) rather than introducing fundamentally new ideas. It positions itself as a data reduction method distinct from traditional active learning (which focuses on labeling cost), but shares significant methodological overlap with various forms of curriculum learning, data distillation, and coreset selection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Paper Summary of IWeS\\n\\nThe paper introduces IWeS as a method to select a small, highly informative subset of a large dataset for more efficient model training. The core idea is to iteratively:\\n1.  Train a model on the currently selected subset of data.\\n2.  Compute an \"importance weight\" for *every* sample in the *entire original dataset* (or a large pool of candidate samples) based on its current utility or impact on the model. This importance is likely derived from the magnitude of its gradient with respect to the loss function, or some related metric indicating \"hardness\" or \"informativeness.\"\\n3.  Select the top-K samples with the highest importance weights to form the new training subset for the next iteration.\\n4.  Repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.\\n\\nThe objective is to achieve comparable model performance to training on the full dataset, but with significantly reduced training time and resources, by focusing only on the most impactful data points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Novelty of the IWeS Algorithm\\n\\nThe novelty of IWeS, as described, appears to be incremental rather than revolutionary.\\n\\n*   **Gradient-based Importance:** The concept of using gradients to gauge sample importance is well-established in machine learning. It forms the basis of:\\n    *   **Influence Functions:** Quantifying how much a training point influences a model\\'s prediction on a test point (requires Hessian-vector products, often expensive).\\n    *   **Active Learning:** Many active learning strategies (e.g., gradient diversity, expected error reduction, uncertainty sampling) leverage gradient information or uncertainty related to a sample\\'s contribution to model learning.\\n    *   **Curriculum Learning/Hard Example Mining:** Implicitly or explicitly, methods like Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) or Focal Loss prioritize samples with high loss or large gradients.\\n    *   **Data Valuation:** Quantifying the \"value\" of a data point, often using Shapley values or gradient-based approaches.\\n\\n*   **Iterative Subset Selection:** The idea of iteratively refining a training set is also not new.\\n    *   **Active Learning:** The entire paradigm is iterative selection.\\n    *   **Coreset Selection:** Many coreset algorithms iteratively build or refine a coreset.\\n    *   **Data Distillation:** While often synthesizing data, some approaches involve iterative pruning or selection.\\n\\n**Where IWeS *might* be novel:**\\nThe specific *combination* of these elements, particularly the iterative re-evaluation of *all candidate samples* for their importance at each step, and its primary stated goal of *training efficiency* on *already labeled data* (as opposed to reducing labeling cost in AL), could be framed as a novel application or refinement of existing techniques. If the paper introduces a *new and computationally efficient* way to compute these \"importance weights\" or a *novel selection strategy* that implicitly ensures diversity, that would significantly boost its novelty score. However, based solely on the description, it seems to be an intelligent fusion of known components.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Practicality of the IWeS Algorithm\\n\\nThe practicality of IWeS is a major concern, especially in the context of large-scale datasets and deep networks.\\n\\n**Strengths (Potential Practicality):**\\n*   **Intuitive:** The concept of training on the \"most important\" data points is easy to grasp and aligns with human learning intuition (focusing on challenging examples).\\n*   **Flexibility:** The \"importance weight\" function can potentially be customized based on the specific problem or model architecture (e.g., loss gradient magnitude, margin, prediction confidence, etc.).\\n*   **Targeted Use Cases:** Could be practical for smaller datasets, fine-tuning pre-trained models on slightly different domains, or where data redundancy is extremely high and the *initial computation cost* can be amortized over many training runs.\\n\\n**Weaknesses (Major Practicality Concerns):**\\n*   **Computational Cost (The \"Killer\" for Deep Learning):** The most significant bottleneck is step 2: \"Compute an \\'importance weight\\' for *every* sample in the *entire original dataset*.\"\\n    *   For a dataset with $N$ samples (e.g., $N=10^6$ to $10^9$ for deep learning), this means performing a forward and backward pass for *each* of these $N$ samples *at every iteration*. If a model takes $T_{batch}$ time to process a batch, processing $N$ samples takes roughly $N / \\\\text{batch_size} \\\\times T_{batch}$. This often equates to multiple full epochs over the entire dataset.\\n    *   This cost is incurred *per iteration* of IWeS. If IWeS requires $M$ iterations, the total cost for importance calculation alone could be $M \\\\times (\\\\text{cost of one full epoch})$. This very quickly dwarfs the training time saved by using a smaller subset.\\n    *   **Example:** If training on full ImageNet (1.2M images) takes 10 hours, and IWeS has 5 iterations, the importance calculation might add 50 hours of overhead *before* even considering the training on the subset. This completely defeats the purpose of efficiency.\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Storing weights for $N$ samples might be an issue for very large $N$.\\n*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The algorithm introduces new hyperparameters:\\n    *   `K`: The size of the subset to select. How is this chosen? Too small, performance drops; too large, benefits diminish.\\n    *   `M`: The number of IWeS iterations. How many iterations are sufficient for convergence or optimal performance?\\n    *   The specific \"importance function\": Which gradient-based metric is best?\\n*   **Risk of Bias/Overfitting:** By continuously focusing on \"hard\" or \"high-gradient\" examples, the selected subset might become less diverse. This could lead to:\\n    *   Overfitting to noisy or adversarial examples.\\n    *   Poor generalization to \"easy\" but common examples necessary for a well-rounded model.\\n    *   Neglecting under-represented classes if their samples are consistently \"easy.\"\\n*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** Lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the optimality or convergence properties of the selected subset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Applicability to Deep Networks\\n\\nAs highlighted above, the applicability of IWeS to deep networks is severely limited by its computational demands.\\n\\n*   **Scalability Issue is Paramount:** Modern deep learning often involves datasets with millions or billions of samples. The proposed method of re-evaluating *all* samples at *each iteration* becomes prohibitively expensive. Even if done in mini-batches, the total number of gradient computations across the entire dataset multiple times is a non-starter for large N.\\n*   **Gradient Stability in Deep Networks:** Gradients in deep networks can be noisy, especially in early training stages or when models are poorly initialized. Relying solely on gradient magnitude for importance might be unstable or misleading. What if a sample has a high gradient because of a temporary local minimum, not true \"hardness\"?\\n*   **Generalization vs. Subset Size:** Deep networks often require vast amounts of diverse data to generalize well. A small subset, even if \"important,\" might not capture the full data distribution necessary for robust performance, especially on complex tasks like image recognition or NLP.\\n*   **Potential Niche:** IWeS *could* be more applicable in specific deep learning scenarios:\\n    *   **Transfer Learning/Fine-tuning:** If applied to a much smaller *target domain* dataset after pre-training on a massive dataset, the $N$ for importance calculation would be smaller.\\n    *   **Active Learning within Deep Learning:** If adapted to an active learning setting where the \"unlabeled pool\" is finite and manageable, and the goal is to pick the most informative samples to label from that pool.\\n    *   **Model Pruning/Distillation Data Selection:** For distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, selecting the most informative training data might be beneficial.\\n\\nFor training complex deep neural networks *from scratch* on massive datasets like ImageNet, OpenImages, or large text corpora, IWeS in its described form would likely be slower and more computationally intensive than simply training on the full dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Comparison to Existing Subset Selection and Active Learning Methods\\n\\nIWeS sits at the intersection of several related fields:\\n\\n*   **Data Distillation/Dataset Condensation:**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Both aim to reduce data for efficient training.\\n    *   **Differences:** Data distillation often *synthesizes* a small, artificial dataset that mimics the training dynamics of the original (e.g., Dataset Condensation, Data Efficient Learning). IWeS *selects* real samples. Data distillation can be computationally intensive at the \"synthesis\" stage but then offers extremely fast training with the distilled set. IWeS has ongoing computational cost.\\n    *   **Comparison:** IWeS is simpler to implement but likely less efficient for extreme data reduction than state-of-the-art data distillation.\\n\\n*   **Coreset Selection:**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Both aim to find a representative subset (coreset) that approximates the full dataset.\\n    *   **Differences:** Coresets often come with theoretical guarantees regarding approximation bounds (e.g., for k-means, PCA, logistic regression), and many rely on geometric properties (e.g., maximum diversity, farthest point sampling, coverage). IWeS is more heuristic and directly optimizes for model training utility via gradients.\\n    *   **Comparison:** Coreset methods are often more theoretically grounded but can be hard to adapt to general deep learning tasks. IWeS is more model-dependent.\\n\\n*   **Active Learning (AL):**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Iterative process, selects \"most informative\" samples, often uses uncertainty or gradient-based metrics.\\n    *   **Key Differences:**\\n        *   **Goal:** AL aims to *reduce labeling costs* by strategically selecting unlabeled data points to be manually labeled. IWeS assumes *all data is already labeled* and aims to *reduce training computation*.\\n        *   **Pool:** AL operates on an *unlabeled pool*. IWeS typically operates on a pool of *already labeled* candidate samples (which could be the entire original dataset).\\n        *   **Mechanism:** While both might use gradient info, AL queries from a distinct unlabeled set. IWeS *re-evaluates* samples from the full labeled set at each step.\\n    *   **Comparison:** IWeS could be seen as an active learning method applied to *training data selection from a pre-labeled pool* rather than querying for new labels. Many AL query strategies (e.g., uncertainty sampling, diversity sampling, query-by-committee, gradient-based sampling) could be adapted as \"importance functions\" for IWeS.\\n\\n*   **Curriculum Learning / Hard Example Mining:**\\n    *   **Similarities:** Both implicitly or explicitly prioritize \"harder\" or more impactful examples during training.\\n    *   **Differences:** Curriculum learning typically orders samples from easy to hard, or dynamically weights them. Hard Example Mining (like OHEM) selects hard examples *within a mini-batch* for loss computation. IWeS *selects a persistent subset* for *all* training iterations.\\n    *   **Comparison:** IWeS is a more explicit and global data selection strategy compared to per-batch mining or general curriculum ordering.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. Specific Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\nTo make IWeS more practical and impactful, especially for deep learning, the following suggestions should be considered:\\n\\n1.  **Address Scalability Directly and Explicitly:** This is the most critical point.\\n    *   **Approximate Importance Calculation:** Instead of computing weights for *all* $N$ samples, explore approximations:\\n        *   **Sampling:** Compute weights only for a randomly sampled subset of the *candidate pool* at each iteration.\\n        *   **Batch-wise Importance:** Can importance be estimated efficiently from mini-batches during a regular epoch? (e.g., average gradient norm per sample in batch, or per-sample loss gradient norm).\\n        *   **Low-Dimensional Projections:** Can we project data into a lower-dimensional space where importance can be estimated faster?\\n        *   **Early Exit for Easy Samples:** Can \"easy\" samples (consistently low loss/gradient) be effectively pruned from the candidate pool early on, reducing the number of samples to re-evaluate?\\n    *   **Computational Complexity Analysis:** Provide a clear breakdown of the computational cost (FLOPs, wall-clock time) of IWeS compared to full training and baselines, highlighting the $O(N)$ dependency per iteration.\\n    *   **Profiling:** Show real-world profiling data demonstrating the time spent on importance calculation vs. training.\\n\\n2.  **Richer Evaluation & Benchmarking:**\\n    *   **Large-Scale Deep Learning Benchmarks:** Evaluate on standard, large-scale deep learning datasets (e.g., ImageNet, large-scale NLP datasets) using complex deep neural networks (ResNets, Transformers). Small-scale experiments (e.g., CIFAR-10 with shallow CNNs) do not demonstrate scalability.\\n    *   **Stronger Baselines:** Compare against state-of-the-art methods in:\\n        *   **Coreset Selection:** Algorithms specifically designed for deep learning (e.g., Grad-Match, Data-Efficient Learning strategies).\\n        *   **Active Learning Adaptations:** Show how well an adapted active learning strategy (e.g., using uncertainty + diversity sampling on the entire labeled dataset for subset selection) performs.\\n        *   **Data Distillation/Condensation:** If relevant to the problem setting.\\n        *   **Simpler Heuristics:** E.g., uniform random sampling (as a baseline), random sampling proportional to class distribution, sampling based on initial loss.\\n    *   **Comprehensive Metrics:** Beyond just accuracy/F1, report:\\n        *   **Total Training Time:** Sum of all IWeS stages + subset training.\\n        *   **Memory Usage:** For importance scores and data handling.\\n        *   **Generalization Robustness:** How well does the model trained on the subset generalize to OOD data, adversarial examples, or minority classes?\\n        *   **Stability:** How sensitive is performance to random seeds, initialization, or specific importance functions?\\n\\n3.  **Ensure Diversity in Selection:**\\n    *   Simply picking the top-K \"most important\" samples can lead to redundancy if many similar samples are all \"hard.\"\\n    *   **Integrate Diversity:** Propose incorporating a diversity criterion into the selection process (e.g., using k-medoids on feature embeddings, determinantal point processes (DPPs), or clustering followed by selecting important samples from each cluster) alongside importance weighting. This is crucial for generalization.\\n\\n4.  **Ablation Studies and Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**\\n    *   Thoroughly investigate the impact of `K` (subset size) and `M` (number of iterations) on both performance and computational cost. Provide guidance on how to choose these.\\n    *   Ablate different \"importance functions\" (e.g., gradient norm, loss value, margin, uncertainty measures) to see which performs best under different conditions.\\n\\n5.  **Theoretical Insights:**\\n    *   While full theoretical guarantees might be challenging, provide some theoretical justification or intuition for *why* IWeS should work. E.g., under what assumptions does selecting high-gradient samples lead to a representative subset? How does the subset size K relate to approximation error?\\n\\n6.  **Clearly Define Ideal Use Cases:**\\n    *   Based on the analysis, articulate specific scenarios where IWeS would genuinely be beneficial (e.g., fine-tuning, domain adaptation with limited target data, specific resource-constrained environments). If it\\'s not for training from scratch on massive datasets, be clear about it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nIWeS presents an interesting heuristic for data subset selection, leveraging intuitive concepts of sample importance. Its strength lies in its flexibility and potential to identify truly impactful data points. However, without substantial innovations in its scalability, particularly the cost of repeated full-dataset importance calculations, it faces significant hurdles for practical adoption in modern deep learning. Addressing these computational challenges and conducting rigorous, large-scale evaluations against strong, relevant baselines will be crucial for IWeS to demonstrate its value and move beyond a promising concept to a widely applicable technique.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.84161215}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Step 5: Collaborative Review Discussion and Consensus Building**\n\n*   Facilitate evidence-based discussion between agents when assessments differ significantly.\n*   Validate each agent's assessment for internal consistency and evidence-based support.\n*   Cross-check all factual claims against the research findings and the paper's content.\n*   Work toward reasoned consensus that balances specialized concerns with overall contribution value.\n*   Ensure all venue-specific evaluation criteria have been adequately addressed.\n*   Apply the Error Handling Protocol autonomously if any quality issues are detected.\n*   When disagreements persist, prioritize the most well-supported arguments while considering the work's overall potential.\n\nThe agents' reviews highlight several key points:\n\n*   **TheoryExpert:** Unable to provide a specific review without the paper content.
