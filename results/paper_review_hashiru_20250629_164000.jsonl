The paper title is: Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\n\nNone: Recent advanced works achieve fair representations and predictions through regularization, adversarial debiasing, and contrastive learning in graph neural networks (GNNs). These methods implicitly encode the sensitive attribute information in the well-trained model weight via backward propagation. In practice, we not only pursue a fair machine learning model but also lend such fairness perception to the public. For current fairness methods, how the sensitive attribute information usage makes the model achieve fair prediction still remains a black box. In this work, we first propose the concept transparency to describe whether the model embraces the ability of lending fairness perception to the public or not. Motivated by the fact that current fairness models lack of transparency, we aim to pursue a fair machine learning model with transparency via explicitly rendering sensitive attribute usage for fair prediction in forward propagation . Specifically, we develop an effective and transparent Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme adopting sensitive attribute information in forward propagation. In this way, FMP explicitly uncovers how sensitive attributes influence final prediction. Additionally, FMP scheme can aggregate useful information from neighbors and mitigate bias in a unified framework to simultaneously achieve graph smoothness and fairness objectives. An acceleration approach is also adopted to improve the efficiency of FMP. Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed FMP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fairness and accuracy on three real-world datasets. The code is available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMP-AD84. 1 INTRODUCTION: Graph neural networks (GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Han et al., 2022a;b) are widely adopted in various domains, such as social media mining (Hamilton et al., 2017), knowledge graph (Hamaguchi et al., 2017) and recommender system (Ying et al., 2018), due to remarkable performance in learning representations. Graph learning, a topic with growing popularity, aims to learn node representation containing both topological and attribute information in a given graph. Despite the outstanding performance in various tasks, GNNs often inherit or even amplify societal bias from input graph data (Dai & Wang, 2021). The biased node representation largely limits the application of GNNs in many high-stake tasks, such as job hunting (Mehrabi et al., 2021) and crime ratio prediction (Suresh & Guttag, 2019). Hence, bias mitigation that facilitates the research on fair GNNs is in an urgent need. Many existing works achieving fair prediction in graph either rely on regularization (Jiang et al., 2022), adversarial debiasing (Dai & Wang, 2021), or contrastive learning (Zhu et al., 2020; 2021b; Agarwal et al., 2021; Kose & Shen, 2022). These methods adopt sensitive attribute information in training loss refinement. In this way, such sensitive attribute can be implicitly encoded in well-trained model weight through backward propagation. However, only achieving fair model is insufficient in practice since the fairness should also lend perception to the public (e.g., the auditors, or the maintainers of machine learning systems). In other words, the influence of sensitive attributes should be easily probed for public. We name such property for public probing as transparency. Specifically, we provide the following formal statement on transparency in fairness: Transparency in fairness: Onlookers can verify the released fair model with \u2022 Transparent influence: How and if the sensitive attribute information influence fair model prediction. \u2022 Less is more: The required resources to obtain the influence of sensitive attributes only includes well-trained model and test data samples 1. From auditors\u2019 perspective, even though the fairness metric for machine learning model is low, such fair model is still untrustful if the auditors cannot understand how the sensitive attributes are adopted to achieve fair prediction given the well-trained model. From maintainer\u2019s perspective, it is important to understand how the model provide fair prediction. Such understanding could help maintainers improve models and further convince auditors in terms of fairness. In summary, transparency aims to make fairness implementation understandable. The transparency aims to make the process of achieving fair model via sensitive attribute informations white-box 2. Therefore, the maintainers and auditors both get benefits from model transparency. More importantly, similar to intrinsic explainability of the model 3, the fairness with transparency property is binary, i.e., the prediction model either embrace the fairness with transparency or not. Based on the formal statement on transparency in fairness, the key rule to determinate whether a fair model is transparent is that the model prediction difference under the cases with and without sensitive attribute information can be identified given the well-trained fair model and test data samples. Unfortunately, many existing fairness works, including regularization, adversarial debiasing, and contrastive learning, do not satisfy transparency requirements in practice. For example, the fair model trained based on existing works are not with transparent influence. This is because the sensitive attribute is implicitly encoded in well-trained model weight. Therefore, it is intractable to infer how sensitive attribute influence the well-trained model weight without access the dynamic model training process. Additionally, for fair model obtained from existing works, the required resources for transparent influence includes training data and training strategy so that the influence of sensitive attributed can be probed via detecting well-trained model weight difference. In a nutshell, the current fair models based on loss refinement lack of transparency. A natural question is raised: Can we find fair prediction model with transparency? In this work, we provide a positive answer via chasing transparency and fairness in message passing of GNNs. The key idea of achieving transparency is to explicitly adopt sensitive attribute in message passing (forward propagation). Specifically, we design an fair and transparent message passing scheme for GNNs, called fair message passing (FMP). First, we formulate an optimization problem that integrates fairness and prediction performance objectives. Then, we solve the formulated problem via Fenchel conjugate and gradient descent to generate fair-and-predictive representation. We also interpret the gradient descent as aggregation first and them debiasing. Finally, we integrate FMP in graph neural networks to achieve fair and accurate prediction for node graph classification task. Further, we demonstrate the superiority of FMP by examining its effectiveness and efficiency, where we adopt the property of softmax function to accelerate the gradient calculation over primal variables. In short, the contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We consider fairness problem from a new perspective, named transparency, i.e., the sensitive attribute should be easily probed for public. We point out that many existing fairness method cannot achieve transparency. \u2022 We propose FMP to achieve fairness with transparency via using sensitive attribute information in message passing. Specifically, we use gradient descent to chasing graph smoothness and fairness in a unified optimization framework. An acceleration method is proposed to reduce gradient computational complexity with theoretical and empirical validation. \u2022 The effectiveness and efficiency of FMP are experimentally evaluated on three real-world datasets. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art, our FMP exhibits a superior trade-off between prediction performance and fairness with negligibly computation overhead. 1A naive way for many existing works (e.g., adding fair regularization, adversarial debiasing, et.al.) to obtain the influence of sensitive attribute is to train fair and unfair model with/without the sensitive attribute information, and then get the prediction difference. Therefore, the required resources includes training data and additional (unfair) model training. 2Similar with the goal of model explainability, only achieving accurate prediction is insufficient, and chasing explainability can help experts understand how the model provide prediction and convince users. 3Decision tree is intrinsic explainable while deep neural networks is not. 2 PRELIMINARIES:  2.1 NOTATIONS: We adopt bold upper-case letters to denote matrix such as X, bold lower-case letters such as x to denote vectors, calligraphic font such as X to denote set. Given a matrix X \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, the i-th row and j-th column are denoted as Xi and X\u00b7,j , and the element in i-th row and j-th column is Xi,j . We use the Frobenius norm, l1 norm of matrix X as ||X||F = \u221a\u2211 i,j X 2 i,j and ||X||1 = \u2211 ij |Xij |, respectively. Given two matrices X,Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, the inner product is defined as \u27e8X,Y\u27e9 = tr(X\u22a4Y), where tr(\u00b7) is the trace of a square matrix. SF (X) represents softmax function with a default normalized column dimension. Let G = {V, E} be a graph with the node set V = {v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vn} and the undirected edge set E = {e1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em}, where n,m represent the number of node and edge, respectively. The graph structure G can be represented as an adjacent matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, where Aij = 1 if existing edge between node vi and node vj . N (i) denotes the neighbors of node vi and N\u0303 (i) = N (i) \u222a {vi} denotes the self-inclusive neighbors. Suppose that each node is associated with a d-dimensional feature vector and a (binary) sensitive attribute, the feature for all nodes and sensitive attribute are denoted as Xori = Rn\u00d7d and s \u2208 {\u22121, 1}n. Define the sensitive attribute incident vector as \u2206s = 1>0(s) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 1>0(\u2212s) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 to normalize each sensitive attribute group, where 1>0(s) is an element-wise indicator function. 2.2 GNNS AS GRAPH SIGNAL DENOISING: A GNN model is usually composed of several stacking GNN layers. Given a graph G with N nodes, a GNN layer typically contains feature transformation Xtrans = ftrans(Xori) and aggregation Xagg = fagg(Xtrans|G), where Xori \u2208 Rn\u00d7din , Xtrans,Xagg \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout represent the input and output features. The feature transformation operation transforms the node feature dimension, and feature aggregation, updates node features based on neighbors\u2019 features and graph topology. Recent works (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a) have established the connections between many feature aggregation operations in representative GNNs and a graph signal denoising problem with Laplacian regularization. Here, we only introduce GCN/SGC as an examples to show the connection from a perspective of graph signal denoising. The more discussions are elaborated in Appendix G. Feature aggregation in Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Simplifying Graph Convolutional Network (SGC) is given by Xagg = A\u0303Xtrans, where A\u0303 = D\u0303\u2212 1 2 A\u0302D\u0303\u2212 1 2 is a normalized self-loop adjacency matrix A\u0302 = A+ I, and D\u0303 is degree matrix of A\u0303. Recent works (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a) provably demonstrate that such feature aggregation is equivalent to one-step gradient descent to minimize tr(F\u22a4 ( I\u2212 A\u0303)F ) with initialization F = Xtrans. 3 FAIR MESSAGE PASSING: In this section, we propose a new message passing scheme to aggregate useful information from neighbors while debiasing representation bias. Specifically, we formulate fair message passing as an optimization problem to pursue smoothness and fair node representation simultaneously. Together with an effective and efficient optimization algorithm, we derive the closed-form fair message passing. Finally, the proposed FMP is shown to be integrated in fair GNNs at three stages, including transformation, aggregation, and debiasing step, as shown in Figure 1. 3.1 THE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK: To achieve graph smoothness prior and fairness in the same process, a reasonable message passing should be a good solution for the following optimization problem: min F \u03bbs 2 tr(FT L\u0303F) + 1 2 ||F\u2212Xtrans||2F\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 hs(F) +\u03bbf ||\u2206sSF (F)||1\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 hf ( \u2206sSF (F) ) . (1) where L\u0303 represents normalized Laplacian matrix, hs(\u00b7) and hf (\u00b7) denotes the smoothness and fairness objectives 4, respectively, and Xtrans \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout is the transformed dout-dimensional node features and F \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout is the aggregated node features of the same matrix size. The first two terms preserve the similarity of connected node representation and thus enforces graph smoothness. The last term enforces fair node representation so that the average predicted probability between groups of different sensitive attributes can remain constant. The regularization coefficients \u03bbs and \u03bbf adaptively control the trade-off between graph smoothness and fairness. Smoothness objective hs(\u00b7). The adjacent matrix in existing graph message passing schemes is normalized for improving numerical stability and achieving superior performance. Similarly, the graph smoothness term requires normalized Laplacian matrix, i.e., L\u0303 = I\u2212A\u0303, A\u0303 = D\u0302\u2212 12 A\u0302D\u0302\u2212 12 , and A\u0302 = A+ I. From edge-centric view, smoothness objective enforces connected node representation to be similar since tr(FT L\u0303F) = \u2211 (vi,vj)\u2208E || Fi\u221a di+1 \u2212 Fj\u221a dj+1 ||2F , where di = \u2211 k Aik represents the degree of node vi. Fairness objective hf (\u00b7). The fairness objective measures the bias for node representation after aggregation. Recall sensitive attribute incident vector \u2206s indicates the sensitive attribute group and group size via the sign and absolute value summation. Recall that the sensitive attribute incident vector as \u2206s = 1>0(s) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 1>0(\u2212s) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 and SF (F) represents the predicted probability for node classification task, where SF (F)ij = P\u0302 (yi = j|X). Furthermore, we can show that our fairness objective is actually equivalent to demographic parity, i.e., ( \u2206sSF (F) )) j = P\u0302 (yi = j|si = 1,X) \u2212 P\u0302 (yi = j|si = \u22121,X). Please see proof in Appendix B. In other words, our fairness objective, l1 norm of \u2206sSF (F) characterizes the predicted probability difference between two groups with different sensitive attribute. Therefore, our proposed optimization framework can pursue graph smoothness and fairness simultaneously. 3.2 ALGORITHM FOR FAIR MESSAGE PASSING: For smoothness objective, many existing popular message passing scheme can be derived based on gradient descent with appropriate step size choice (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a). However, directly computing the gradient of the fairness term makes the closed-form gradient complicated since the gradient of l1 norm involves the sign of elements in the vector. 3.2.1 BI-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM FORMULATION.: To solve this optimization problem in a more effective and efficient manner, Fenchel conjugate (Rockafellar, 2015) is introduced to transform the original problem as bi-level optimization problem. Fenchel conjugate (Rockafellar, 2015) (a.k.a. convex conjugate) is the key tool to transform the original problem into bi-level optimization problem. For the general convex function h(\u00b7), its conjugate function is defined as h\u2217(U) \u25b3 = sup X \u27e8U,X\u27e9 \u2212 h(X). Based on Fenchel conjugate, the fairness objective can be transformed as variational representation hf (p) = sup u \u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2212 h\u2217f (u), where p = \u2206sSF (F) \u2208 R1\u00d7dout is a predicted probability vector for classification. Furthermore, the original optimization problem is equivalent to min F max u hs(F) + \u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2212 h\u2217f (u) (2) where u \u2208 R1\u00d7dout and h\u2217f (\u00b7) is the conjugate function of fairness objective hf (\u00b7). 3.2.2 PROBLEM SOLUTION: Motivated by Proximal Alternating Predictor-Corrector (PAPC) (Loris & Verhoeven, 2011; Chen et al., 2013), the min-max optimization problem (2) can be solved by the following fixed-point 4Such smoothness objetive is the the most common-used one in existing methods (Ma et al., 2021b; Belkin & Niyogi, 2001; Kalofolias, 2016). The various other smoothness objectives could be considered to improve the performance of FMP and we leave it for future work. equations { F = F\u2212\u2207hs(F)\u2212 \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F , u = proxh\u2217f ( u+\u2206sSF (F) ) . (3) where proxh\u2217f (u) = argminy ||y \u2212 u|| 2 F + h \u2217 f (u). Similar to \u201cpredictor-corrector\" algorithm (Loris & Verhoeven, 2011), we adopt iterative algorithm to find saddle point for min-max optimization problem. Specifically, starting from (Fk,uk), we adopt a gradient descent step on primal variable F to arrive (F\u0304k+1,uk) and then followed by a proximal ascent step in the dual variable u. Finally, a gradient descent step on primal variable in point (F\u0304k+1,uk) to arrive at (Fk+1,uk). In short, the iteration can be summarized as F\u0304k+1 = Fk \u2212 \u03b3\u2207hs(Fk)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,u k\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk , uk+1 = prox\u03b2h\u2217f ( uk + \u03b2\u2206sSF (F\u0304 k+1) ) , F\u0304k+1 = Fk \u2212 \u03b3\u2207hs(Fk)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,u k+1\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk . (4) where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are the step size for primal and dual variables. Note that the close-form for \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout and prox\u03b2h\u2217f (\u00b7) are still not clear, we will provide the solution one by one. Proximal Operator. As for the proximal operators, we provide the close-form in the following proposition: Proposition 1 (Proximal Operators) The proximal operators prox\u03b2h\u2217f (u) satisfies prox\u03b2h\u2217f (u)j = sign(u)j min ( |uj |, \u03bbf ) , (5) where sign(\u00b7) and \u03bbf are element-wise sign function and hyperparameter for fairness objective. In other words, such proximal operator is element-wise projection onto l\u221e ball with radius \u03bbf . FMP Scheme. Similar to works (Ma et al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2021), choosing \u03b3 = 11+\u03bbs and \u03b2 = 12\u03b3 , we have Fk \u2212 \u03b3\u2207hs(Fk) = ( (1\u2212 \u03b3)I\u2212 \u03b3\u03bbsL\u0303 ) Fk + \u03b3Xtrans = \u03b3Xtrans + (1\u2212 \u03b3)A\u0303Fk, (6) Therefore, we can summarize the proposed FMP as two phases, including propagation with skip connection (Step \u2776) and bias mitigation (Steps \u2777-\u277a). For bias mitigation, Step \u2777 updates the aggregated node features for fairness objective; Steps \u2778 and \u2779 aim to learn and \u201creshape\" perturbation vector in probability space, respectively. Step \u277a explicitly mitigate the bias of node features based on gradient descent on primal variable. The mathematical formulation is given as follows: Xk+1agg = \u03b3Xtrans + (1\u2212 \u03b3)A\u0303Xk, Step \u2776 F\u0304k+1 = Xk+1agg \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,uk\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk , Step \u2777 u\u0304k+1 = uk + \u03b2\u2206sSF (F\u0304 k+1), Step \u2778 uk+1 = min ( |u\u0304k+1|, \u03bbf ) \u00b7 sign(u\u0304k+1), Step \u2779 Fk+1 = Xk+1agg \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,uk+1\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk . Step \u277a where Xk+1agg represents the node features with normal aggregation and skip connection with the transformed input Xtrans. 3.2.3 GRADIENT COMPUTATION ACCELERATION: The softmax property is also adopted to accelerate the gradient computation. Note that p = \u2206sSF (F) and SF (\u00b7) represents softmax over column dimension, directly computing the gradient \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F based on chain rule involves the three-dimensional tensor \u2202p\u2202F with gigantic computation complexity. Instead, we simplify the gradient computation based on the property of softmax function in the following theorem. Theorem 1 (Gradient Computation) The gradient over primal variable \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F satisfies \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202F = Us \u2299 SF (F)\u2212 Sum1(Us \u2299 SF (F))SF (F). (7) where Us \u25b3 = \u2206\u22a4s u, \u2299 represents element-wise product and Sum1(\u00b7) represents the summation over column dimension with preserved matrix shape. 3.3 DISCUSSION ON FMP: In this section, we provide the interpretation and analyze the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of proposed FMP scheme. Specifically, we interprete FMP as two phrases, including conventional aggregation and bias mitigation, and the computation complexity of FMP is lower than backward gradient calculation. Interpretation Note that the gradient of fairness objective over node features F satisfies \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F = \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202SF (F) \u2202SF (F) \u2202F and \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202SF (F) = \u2206 \u22a4 s u, such gradient calculation can be interpreted as three steps: Softmax transformation, perturbation in probability space, and debiasing in representation space. Specifcally, we first map the node representation into probability space via softmax transformation. Subsequently, we calculate the gradient of fairness objective in probability space. It is seen that the perturbation \u2206\u22a4s u actually poses low-rank debiasing in probability space, where the nodes with different sensitive attribute embrace opposite perturbation. In other words, the dual variable u represents the perturbation direction in probability space. Finally, the perturbation in probability space will be transformed into representation space via Jacobian transformation \u2202SF (F)\u2202F . Transparency The proposed FMP explicitly uses the sensitive attribute information in Steps \u2777-\u277a during forward propagation. In other words, if we aims to identify the influence of sensitive attributes for FMP, it is sufficient to check the difference between the input and output for debiasing step. It is worth mentioning that the required information for identifying the influence of sensitive attributes are naturally from the forward propagation. However, for the fair model from existing works (e.g, adding regularization and adversarial debiasing), note that the sensitive attribute information is implicitly encoded in the well-trained model weight, the sensitive attribute perturbation inevitably lead to variability of well-trained model weight. Therefore, it is required to retrain the model for probing the influence of sensitive attribute perturbation. The key drawback of these methods is due to encoding the sensitive attributes information into well-trained model weights. From aditors\u2019 perspective, it is quite hard to identify the influence of sensitive attributes only given well-trained fair model. Instead, our designed FMP explicitly adopts the sensitive attribute information in the forward propagation process, which naturally avoid the dilemma that sensitive attributes are encoded into well-trained model weight. In a nutshell, FMP encompasses with higher transparency since (1) the sensitive attribute is explicitly adopted in forward propagation; (2) It is not necessary to retrain model for probing influence of sensitive attribute. Efficiency FMP is an efficient message passing scheme. The computation complexity for the aggregation (sparse matrix multiplications) is O(mdout), where m is the number of edges in the graph. For FMP, the extra computation mainly focus on the perturbation calculation, as shown in Theorem 1, with the computation complexity O(ndout). The extra computation complexity is negligible in that the number of nodes n is far less than the number of edges m in the real-world graph. Additionally, if directly adopting autograd to calculate the gradient via back propagation, we have to calculate the three-dimensional tensor \u2202p\u2202F with computation complexity O(n 2dout). In other words, thanks to the softmax property, we achieve an efficient fair message passing scheme. Effectiveness The proposed FMP explicitly achieves graphs smoothness prior and fairness via alternative gradient descent. In other words, the propagation and debiasing forward in a white-box manner and there is not any trainable weight during forwarding phrase. The effectiveness of the proposed FMP is also validated in the experiments on three real-world datasets. 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed FMP. We firstly validate that graph data with large sensitive homophily enhances bias in GNNs via synthetic experiments. Moreover, for experiments on real-world datasets, we introduce the experimental settings and then evaluate our proposed FMP compared with several baselines in terms of prediction performance and fairness metrics. 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS: Datasets. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets Pokec-z, Pokec-n, and NBA (Dai & Wang, 2021). Pokec-z and Pokec-n are sampled, based on province information, from a larger Facebook-like social network Pokec (Takac & Zabovsky, 2012) in Slovakia, where region information is treated as the sensitive attribute and the predicted label is the working field of the users. NBA dataset is extended from a Kaggle dataset 5 consisting of around 400 NBA basketball players. The information of players includes age, nationality, and salary in the 2016-2017 season. The players\u2019 link relationships is from Twitter with the official crawling API. The binary nationality (U.S. and overseas player) is adopted as the sensitive attribute and the prediction label is whether the salary is higher than the median. Evaluation Metrics. We adopt accuracy to evaluate the performance of node classification task. As for fairness metric, we adopt two quantitative group fairness metrics to measure the prediction bias. According to works (Louizos et al., 2015; Beutel et al., 2017), we adopt demographic parity \u2206DP = |P(y\u0302 = 1|s = \u22121) \u2212 P(y\u0302 = 1|s = 1)| and equal opportunity \u2206EO = |P(y\u0302 = 1|s = 5https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba Pokec-n Pokec-z NBA \u22121, y = 1)\u2212 P(y\u0302 = 1|s = 1, y = 1)|, where y and y\u0302 represent the ground-truth label and predicted label, respectively. Baselines. We compare our proposed FMP with representative GNNs, such as GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GAT (Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), and APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2019), and MLP. For all models, we train 2 layers neural networks with 64 hidden units for 300 epochs. Additionally, We also compare adversarial debiasing and adding demographic regularization methods to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Implementation Details. We run the experiments 5 times and report the average performance for each method. We adopt Adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate and 10\u22125 weight decay for all models. For adversarial debiasing, we adopt train classifier and adversary with 70 and 30 epochs, respectively. The hyperparameter for adversary loss is tuned in {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0}. For adding regularization, we adopt the hyperparameter set {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, 80.0, 100.0}. 4.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: Comparison with existng GNNs. The accuracy, demographic parity and equal opportunity metrics of proposed FMP for Pokec-z, Pokec-n, NBA dataset are shown in Table 1 compared with MLP, GAT, GCN, SGC and APPNP. The detailed statistical information for these three dataset is shown in Table 3. From these results, we can obtain the following observations: \u2022 Many existing GNNs underperorm MLP model on all three datasets in terms of fairness metric. For instance, the demographic parity of MLP is lower than GAT, GCN, SGC and APPNP by 32.64%, 50.46%, 66.53% and 58.72% on Pokec-z dataset. The higher prediction bias comes from the aggregation within the-same-sensitive-attribute nodes and topology bias in graph data. \u2022 Our proposed FMP consistently achieve lowest prediction bias in terms of demographic parity and equal opportunity on all datasets. Specifically, FMP reduces demographic parity by 49.69%, 56.86% and 5.97% compared with the lowest bias among all baselines in Pokec-z, Pokec-n, and NBA dataset. Meanwhile, our proposed FMP achieves the best accuracy in NBA dataset, and comparable accuracy in Pokec-z and Pokec-n datasets. In a nutshell, proposed FMP can effectively mitigate prediction bias while preserving the prediction performance. Comparison with adversarial debiasing and regularization. To validate the effectiveness of proposed FMP, we also show the prediction performance and fairness metric trade-off compared with fairness-boosting methods, including adversarial debiasing (Fisher et al., 2020) and adding regularization (Chuang & Mroueh, 2020). Similar to (Louppe et al., 2017), the output of GNNs is the input of adversary and the goal of adversary is to predict the node sensitive attribute. We also adopt several backbones for these two methods, including MLP, GCN, GAT and SGC. We randomly split 50%/25%/25% for training, validation and test dataset. Figure 2 shows the pareto optimality curve for all methods, where right-bottom corner point represents the ideal performance (highest accuracy and lowest prediction bias). From the results, we list the following observations as follows: \u2022 Our proposed FMP can achieve better DP-Acc trade-off compared with adversarial debiasing and adding regularization for many GNNs and MLP. Such observation validates the effectiveness of the key idea in FMP: aggregation first and then debiasing. Additionally, FMP can reduce demographic parity with negligible performance cost due to transparent and efficient debiasing. \u2022 Message passing in GNNs does matter. For adding regularization or adversarial debiasing, different GNNs embrace huge distinctionwhich implies that appropriate message passing manner potentially leads to better trade-off performance. Additionally, many GNNs underperforms MLP in low label homophily coefficient dataset, such as NBA. The rationale is that aggregation may not always bring benefit in terms of accuracy when the neighbors have low probability with the same label. 5 RELATED WORKS: Graph neural networks. GNNs generalizing neural networks for graph data have already been shown great success for various real-world applications. There are two streams in GNNs model design, i.e., spectral-based and spatial-based. Spectral-based GNNs provide graph convolution definition based on graph theory, which is utilized in GNN layers together with feature transformation (Bruna et al., 2013; Defferrard et al., 2016; Henaff et al., 2015). Graph convolutional networks (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017) simplifies spectral-based GNN model into spatial aggregation scheme. Since then, many spatial-based GNNs variant are developed to update node representation via aggregating its neighbors\u2019 information, including graph attention network (GAT) (Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2019), et al (Gao et al., 2018; Monti et al., 2017). Graph signal denoising is another perspective to understand GNNs. Recently, there are several works show that GCN is equivalent to the first-order approximation for graph denoising with Laplacian regularization (Henaff et al., 2015; Zhao & Akoglu, 2019). The unified optimization framework are provided to unify many existing message passing schemes (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a). Fairness-aware learning on graphs. Many works have been developed to achieve fairness in machine learning community (Jiang et al., 2022; Chuang & Mroueh, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; Du et al., 2021; Yurochkin & Sun, 2020; Creager et al., 2019; Feldman et al., 2015). A pilot study on fair node representation learning is developed based on random walk (Rahman et al., 2019). Additionally, adversarial debiasing is adopt to learn fair prediction or node representation so that the well-trained adversary can not predict the sensitvie attribute based on node representation or prediction (Dai & Wang, 2021; Bose & Hamilton, 2019; Fisher et al., 2020). A Bayesian approach is developed to learn fair node representation via encoding sensitive information in prior distribution in (Buyl & De Bie, 2020). Work (Ma et al., 2021a) develops a PAC-Bayesian analysis to connect subgroup generalziation with accuracy parity. (Laclau et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021) aim to mitigate prediction bias for link prediction. Fairness-aware graph contrastive learning are proposed in (Agarwal et al., 2021; K\u00f6se & Shen, 2021). However, aforementioned works ignore the requirement of transparency in fairness. In this work, we develop an efficient and transparent fair message passing scheme explicitly rendering sensitive attribute usage. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we consider fairness problem from a new perspective, named transparency, i.e., the influence of sensitive attribute should be easily probed to public. We point out that existing fairness model in graph lack of transparency due to implicitly encoding sensitive attribute information in welltrained model weight. Additionally, integrated in a unified optimization framework, we develop an efficient, effective and transparent FMP to learn fair node representations while preserving prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines in node classification tasks. B PROOF ON FAIRNESS OBJECTIVE: The fairness objective can be shown as the average prediction probability difference as follows:( \u2206sSF (F) )) j = [ 1>0(s) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 1>0(\u2212s) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 ]( SF (F) ) :,j = \u2211 si=1 P\u0302 (yi = j|X) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 \u2211 si=\u22121 P\u0302 (yi = j|X) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 = P\u0302 (yi = j|si = 1,X)\u2212 P\u0302 (yi = j|si = \u22121,X). C PROOF OF THEOREM 1: Before providing in-depth analysis on the gradient computation, we first introduce the softmax function derivative property in the following lemma: Lemma 1 For the softmax function with N -dimensional vector input y = SF (x) : R1\u00d7N \u2212\u2192 R1\u00d7N , where yj = e xj\u2211N k=1 e xk for \u2200j \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}, the derivative N \u00d7 N Jocobian matrix is defined by [\u2202y\u2202x ]ij = \u2202yi \u2202xj . Additionally, Jocobian matrix satisfies \u2202y\u2202x = yIN \u2212 y \u22a4y, where IN represents N \u00d7N identity matrix and \u22a4 denotes the transpose operation for vector or matrix. Proof: Considering the gradient \u2202yi\u2202xj for arbitrary ij, according to quotient and chain rule of derivatives, we have \u2202yi \u2202xj = exi \u2211N k=1 e xk \u2212 exi+xj(\u2211N k=1 e xk )2 = exi\u2211N k=1 e xk \u00b7 \u2211N k=1 e xk \u2212 exi\u2211N k=1 e xk = yi(1\u2212 yj), (8) Similarly, for arbitrary i \u0338= j, the gradient is given by \u2202yi \u2202xj = exi\u2211N k=1 e xk \u00b7 \u2212e xi\u2211N k=1 e xk = \u2212yiyj . (9) Combining these two cases, it is easy to verify the Jocobian matrix satisfies \u2202y\u2202x = yIN \u2212 y \u22a4y. \u25a1 Arming with the derivative property of softmax function, we further investigate the gradient \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F , where p = \u2206sSF (F) \u2208 R1\u00d7dout and SF (\u00b7) and u \u2208 R1\u00d7dout is independent with F \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout . Considering softmax function SF (x) \u2208 Rn\u00d7d is row-wise adopted in node representation matrix, the gradient satisfies \u2202SF (F)i\u2202Fj = 0dout\u00d7dout for i \u0338= j. Note that the inner product \u27e8p,u\u27e9 = \u2211dout k=1 pkuk, it is easy the obtain the gradient [\u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F ]ij = \u2211dout k=1 \u2202pk \u2202Fij uk. To simply the current notation, we denote F\u0303 \u25b3 = SF (F). According to chain rule of derivative, we have \u2202pk \u2202Fij = dout\u2211 t=1 \u2202pk \u2202F\u0303tk \u2202F\u0303tk \u2202Fij = dout\u2211 t=1 \u2206s,t \u2202F\u0303tk \u2202Fij (a) = \u2206s,i \u2202F\u0303ik \u2202Fij (b) = \u2206s,iF\u0303ik[\u03b4kj \u2212 F\u0303ij ], (10) where \u03b4kj is Dirac function (equals 1 only if k = j, otherwise 0;), equality (a) holds since softmax function is row-wise operation, and equality (b) is based on Lemma 1. Furthermore, we can obtain the gradient of fairness objective w.r.t. node presentation as follows: [ \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202F ]ij = dout\u2211 k=1 \u2202pk \u2202Fij uk = dout\u2211 k=1 \u2206s,iF\u0303ik[\u03b4kj \u2212 F\u0303ij ]uk = \u2206s,iF\u0303ijuj \u2212\u2206s,iF\u0303ij dout\u2211 k=1 F\u0303ikuk. (11) Therefore, the matrix formulation is given by \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202F = Us \u2299 SF (F)\u2212 Sum1(Us \u2299 SF (F))SF (F). (12) where Us \u25b3 = \u2206\u22a4s u \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout and Sum1(\u00b7) represents the summation over column dimension with preserved matrix shape. Therefore, the computation complexity for gradient \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F is O(ndout). D PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1: We firstly show the conjugate function for general norm function f(x) = \u03bb||x||, where x \u2208 R1\u00d7dout . The conjugate function of f(x) satisfies f\u2217(y) = { 0, ||x||\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb, +\u221e, ||x||\u2217 > \u03bb. (13) where ||x||\u2217 is dual norm of the original norm ||x||, defined as ||y||\u2217 = max ||x||\u22641 y\u22a4x. Considering the conjugate function definition f\u2217(y) = max x y\u22a4x\u2212\u03bb||x|| the analysis can be divided as the following two cases: \u2776 If ||y||\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb, according to the definition of dual norm, we have y\u22a4x \u2264 ||x||||y||\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb||x|| for \u2200||x||, where the equality holds if and only if ||x|| = 0. Hence, it is easy to obtain f\u2217(y) = max x y\u22a4x\u2212 \u03bb||x|| = 0. \u2777 If ||y||\u2217 > \u03bb, note that the dual norm ||y||\u2217 = max ||x||\u22641 y\u22a4x > \u03bb, there exists variables x\u0302 so that ||x\u0302|| \u2264 1 and x\u0302\u22a4y < \u03bb. Therefore, for any constant t, we have f\u2217(y) \u2265 y\u22a4(tx) \u2212 \u03bb||tx|| = t(y\u22a4x\u2212 \u03bb||x||) t\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 \u221e. Based on aforementioned two cases, it is easy to get the conjugate function for l1 norm (the dual norm is l\u221e), i.e., the conjugate function for hf (x) = \u03bb||x||1 is given by h\u2217f (y) = { 0, ||x||\u221e \u2264 \u03bb, +\u221e, ||x||\u221e > \u03bb. (14) Given the conjugate function h\u2217f (\u00b7), we further investigate the proximal operators proxh\u2217f . Note that proxh\u2217f (u) = argminy ||y \u2212 u|| 2 F + h \u2217 f (u) = arg min||y||\u221e\u2264\u03bbf ||y \u2212 u||2F = arg min yj\u2264\u03bbf \u2200j\u2208[dout] \u2211dout j=1 |yj \u2212 uj |2, the proximal operator problem can be decomposed as element-wise sub-problem, i.e., proxh\u2217f (u)j = arg minyj\u2264\u03bbf |yj \u2212 uj |2 = sign(uj)min(|uj |, \u03bbf ) which completes the proof. E TRAINING ALGORITHMS: We summarize the training algorithm for FMP and provide the pseudo codes in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: FMP Training Algorithm Input :Graph dataset =(X,A,Y); The total epochs T ; Hyperparameters \u03bbs and \u03bbf . Output :The well-trained FMP model. 1 for epoch from 1 to T do 2 Conduct feature transformation using MLP; 3 Conduct propagation and debiasing as steps \u2776-\u277a; 4 Calculate the cross entropy loss for node classification task; 5 Conduct back propagation step to update model weight; 6 end F DATASET STATISTICS: For fair comparison with previous work, we perform the node classification task on three real-world dataset, including Pokec-n, Pokec-z, and NBA. The data statistical information on three real-world dataset is provided in Table 3. It is seen that the sensitive homophily are even higher than label homophily coefficient among three real-world dataset, which validates that the real-world dataset are usually with large topology bias. G MORE DISCUSSION ON GNNS AS GRAPH SIGNAL DENOISING: In this section, we provide more examples to show many existing GNNs can be interpreted as graph signal denoising problem, including GAT and APPNP. GAT. Feature aggregation in GAT applies the normalized attention coefficient to compute a linear combination of neighbor\u2019s features as Xagg,i = \u2211 j\u2208N (i) \u03b1ijXtrans,j , where \u03b1ij = softmaxj(eij), eij = LeakyReLU(X\u22a4trans,iwi + X \u22a4 trans,jwj), and wi and wj are learnable column vectors. Prior study (Ma et al., 2021b) demonstrates that one-step gradient descent with adaptive step size 1\u2211 j\u2208N\u0303(i)(ci+cj) for the following objective problem: PPNP / APPNP. Feature aggregation in PPNP and APPNP adopt the aggregation rules as Xagg = \u03b1 ( I \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)A\u0303 )\u22121 Xtrans and Xk+1agg = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)A\u0303Xkagg + \u03b1Xtrans. It is shown that they are equivalent to the exact solution and one gradient descent step with stepsize \u03b12 to minimize the following objective problem: min F ||F\u2212Xtrans||2F + ( 1 \u03b1 \u2212 1)tr ( F\u22a4(I\u2212 A\u0303)F ) . H MORE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: H.1 MORE EXPERIMENTAL SETTING DETAILS In FMP implementation, we first use 2 layers MLP with 64 hidden units and the output dimension for MLP is 2. We also stack 2 layers for propagation and debiasing steps, where there is not any trainable model parameters. As for the model training, we adopt cross entropy loss function with 300 epochs. We also adopt Adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate and 1 \u00d7 105 weight decay for all models. The hyperprameters for FMP is \u03bbf = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 100} and \u03bbs = {0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20} . H.2 COMPARISON WITH FAIR MIXUP We also implement Fair mixup (Chuang & Mroueh, 2021) as the additional baseline for different GNN backbones in Figure 3. Note that input fair mixup requires calculating model prediction for mixed input batch, it is non-trivial to adopt input fair mixup in our experiments (node classification task) since forward propagation in GNN aggregates information from neighborhoods while the neighborhood information for the mixed input batch is missing. Therefore, we adopt manifold fair mixup for the logit layer (the previous layers contain aggregation step) in our experiments. Experimental results show that our method can still achieve better accuracy-fairness tradeoff performance on three datasets. H.3 SENSITIVE ATTRIBUTE INFLUENCE PROBE As for lending fairness perceptron, it represents the influence of sensitive attributes could be identified. For example, our proposed FMP includes three steps, i.e., transformation, aggregation and debiasing, where the sensitive attribute explicitly adopted in debiasing step. If we aims to identify the influence of sensitive attributes for FMP, it is sufficient to check the difference between the input and output for debiasing step. It is worth mentioning that the required information for identifying the influence of sensitive attributes are naturally from the forward propagation. Additionally, if we aim to identify the influence of sensitive attributes for existing methods (e.g, adding regularization and adversarial debiasing), the well-trained fair model is insufficient and we need additional vanilla (unfair) model without using any sensitive attribute information. In other words, these methods require model retraining with sensitive attribute removement and thus much more resources for sensitive attributes influence auditing. The key drawback of these methods is due to encoding the sensitive attributes information into well-trained model weights. From auditors\u2019 perspective, it is quite hard to identify the influence of sensitive attributes only given well-trained fair model. Instead, our designed FMP explicitly adopts the sensitive attribute information in the forward propagation process, which naturally avoid the dilemma that sensitive attributes are encoded into well-trained model weight. Figure 4 shows the visualization results for training with/without (left/right) sensitive attribute for FMP and several baselines (with GCN backbones) across three real-world datasets. From the visualization results, we observe that all methods with sensitive attribute information achieve better fairness since the logit layer representation for different sensitive attributes are mixed with each other. Therefore, it is hard to identify the sensitive attribute based on the representation and thus leads to higher fairness results. The key different is that the results for training with/without (left/right) sensitive attribute in FMP can both obtained through the forward propagation, while the other baseline methods requiring model retraining to probe the influence of sensitive attributes. H.4 RUNNING TIME COMPARISON We provide running time comparison in Figure 5 for our proposed FMP and other baselines, including vanilla, regularization and adversarial debiasing on many backbones (MLP, GCN, GAT, SGC, and APPNP). To achieve fair comparison, we adopt the same Adam optimizer with 200 epochs with 5 running times. We list several observations as follows: \u2022 The running time of proposed FMP is very efficient for large-scale dataset. Specifically, for vanilla method, the running time of FMP is higher than most lighten backbone MLP with 46.97% and 15.03% time overhead on Pokec-n and Poken-z dataset, respectively. Compared with the most timeconsumption APPNP, the running time of FMP is lower with 64.07% and 41.45% time overhead on Pokec-n and Poken-z dataset, respectively. \u2022 The regularization method achieves almost the same running time compared with vanilla method on all backbones. For example, GCN with regularization encompasses higher running time with 6.41% time overhead compared with vanilla method. Adversarial debiasing is extremely time-consuming. For example, GCN with adversarial debiasing encompasses higher running time with 88.58% time overhead compared with vanilla method. H.5 HYPERPARAMETER STUDY We provide hyperparameter study for further investigation on fairness and smoothness hyperparmeter on prediction and fairness performance on three datasets. Specifically, we tune hyperparameters as \u03bbf = {0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 100.0, 1000.0} and \u03bbs = {0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0}. From the results in Figure 6, we can make the following observations: \u2022 The accuracy and demographic parity are extremely sensitive to smoothness hyperparameter. It is seen that, for Pokec-n and Pokec-z datasets (NBA), larger smoothness hyperparameter usually leads to higher (lower) accuracy with higher prediction bias. The rationale is that, only for graph data with high label homophily coefficient, GCN-like aggregation with skip connection is beneficial. Otherwise, the neighbor\u2019s node representation with different label will mislead representation update. \u2022 The appropriate fairness hyperparameter leads to better fairness and prediction performance tradeoff. The reason is that fairness hyperparameter determinates the perturbation vector update step size in probability space. Only appropriate step size can lead to better perturbation vector update. I BROADER SOCIAL IMPACT AND LIMITATIONS: Transparency is an advanced property in fairness domain and poses huge challenging for research and industrial. Many existing works mainly rely on specific fairness metric to evaluate the prediction bias. The transparency may stimulates maintainers and auditors of machine learning system to rethink the fairness evaluation/auditing. Only achieving fair model with lower bias for specific fairness metric is insufficient. The maintainers should also consider how to leverage the influence of sensitive attribute for auditors. The transparency may lead maintainers pay more effects in improving the transparency of fair model and could be helpful to convince the auditors. The limitations of this work are that it requests sensitive information in the inference stage.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023. Remember you need to make 3 reviewer agents for each paper. GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\n\nNone: Recent advanced works achieve fair representations and predictions through regularization, adversarial debiasing, and contrastive learning in graph neural networks (GNNs). These methods implicitly encode the sensitive attribute information in the well-trained model weight via backward propagation. In practice, we not only pursue a fair machine learning model but also lend such fairness perception to the public. For current fairness methods, how the sensitive attribute information usage makes the model achieve fair prediction still remains a black box. In this work, we first propose the concept transparency to describe whether the model embraces the ability of lending fairness perception to the public or not. Motivated by the fact that current fairness models lack of transparency, we aim to pursue a fair machine learning model with transparency via explicitly rendering sensitive attribute usage for fair prediction in forward propagation . Specifically, we develop an effective and transparent Fair Message Passing (FMP) scheme adopting sensitive attribute information in forward propagation. In this way, FMP explicitly uncovers how sensitive attributes influence final prediction. Additionally, FMP scheme can aggregate useful information from neighbors and mitigate bias in a unified framework to simultaneously achieve graph smoothness and fairness objectives. An acceleration approach is also adopted to improve the efficiency of FMP. Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed FMP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fairness and accuracy on three real-world datasets. The code is available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMP-AD84. 1 INTRODUCTION: Graph neural networks (GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Han et al., 2022a;b) are widely adopted in various domains, such as social media mining (Hamilton et al., 2017), knowledge graph (Hamaguchi et al., 2017) and recommender system (Ying et al., 2018), due to remarkable performance in learning representations. Graph learning, a topic with growing popularity, aims to learn node representation containing both topological and attribute information in a given graph. Despite the outstanding performance in various tasks, GNNs often inherit or even amplify societal bias from input graph data (Dai & Wang, 2021). The biased node representation largely limits the application of GNNs in many high-stake tasks, such as job hunting (Mehrabi et al., 2021) and crime ratio prediction (Suresh & Guttag, 2019). Hence, bias mitigation that facilitates the research on fair GNNs is in an urgent need. Many existing works achieving fair prediction in graph either rely on regularization (Jiang et al., 2022), adversarial debiasing (Dai & Wang, 2021), or contrastive learning (Zhu et al., 2020; 2021b; Agarwal et al., 2021; Kose & Shen, 2022). These methods adopt sensitive attribute information in training loss refinement. In this way, such sensitive attribute can be implicitly encoded in well-trained model weight through backward propagation. However, only achieving fair model is insufficient in practice since the fairness should also lend perception to the public (e.g., the auditors, or the maintainers of machine learning systems). In other words, the influence of sensitive attributes should be easily probed for public. We name such property for public probing as transparency. Specifically, we provide the following formal statement on transparency in fairness: Transparency in fairness: Onlookers can verify the released fair model with \u2022 Transparent influence: How and if the sensitive attribute information influence fair model prediction. \u2022 Less is more: The required resources to obtain the influence of sensitive attributes only includes well-trained model and test data samples 1. From auditors\u2019 perspective, even though the fairness metric for machine learning model is low, such fair model is still untrustful if the auditors cannot understand how the sensitive attributes are adopted to achieve fair prediction given the well-trained model. From maintainer\u2019s perspective, it is important to understand how the model provide fair prediction. Such understanding could help maintainers improve models and further convince auditors in terms of fairness. In summary, transparency aims to make fairness implementation understandable. The transparency aims to make the process of achieving fair model via sensitive attribute informations white-box 2. Therefore, the maintainers and auditors both get benefits from model transparency. More importantly, similar to intrinsic explainability of the model 3, the fairness with transparency property is binary, i.e., the prediction model either embrace the fairness with transparency or not. Based on the formal statement on transparency in fairness, the key rule to determinate whether a fair model is transparent is that the model prediction difference under the cases with and without sensitive attribute information can be identified given the well-trained fair model and test data samples. Unfortunately, many existing fairness works, including regularization, adversarial debiasing, and contrastive learning, do not satisfy transparency requirements in practice. For example, the fair model trained based on existing works are not with transparent influence. This is because the sensitive attribute is implicitly encoded in well-trained model weight. Therefore, it is intractable to infer how sensitive attribute influence the well-trained model weight without access the dynamic model training process. Additionally, for fair model obtained from existing works, the required resources for transparent influence includes training data and training strategy so that the influence of sensitive attributed can be probed via detecting well-trained model weight difference. In a nutshell, the current fair models based on loss refinement lack of transparency. A natural question is raised: Can we find fair prediction model with transparency? In this work, we provide a positive answer via chasing transparency and fairness in message passing of GNNs. The key idea of achieving transparency is to explicitly adopt sensitive attribute in message passing (forward propagation). Specifically, we design an fair and transparent message passing scheme for GNNs, called fair message passing (FMP). First, we formulate an optimization problem that integrates fairness and prediction performance objectives. Then, we solve the formulated problem via Fenchel conjugate and gradient descent to generate fair-and-predictive representation. We also interpret the gradient descent as aggregation first and them debiasing. Finally, we integrate FMP in graph neural networks to achieve fair and accurate prediction for node graph classification task. Further, we demonstrate the superiority of FMP by examining its effectiveness and efficiency, where we adopt the property of softmax function to accelerate the gradient calculation over primal variables. In short, the contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We consider fairness problem from a new perspective, named transparency, i.e., the sensitive attribute should be easily probed for public. We point out that many existing fairness method cannot achieve transparency. \u2022 We propose FMP to achieve fairness with transparency via using sensitive attribute information in message passing. Specifically, we use gradient descent to chasing graph smoothness and fairness in a unified optimization framework. An acceleration method is proposed to reduce gradient computational complexity with theoretical and empirical validation. \u2022 The effectiveness and efficiency of FMP are experimentally evaluated on three real-world datasets. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art, our FMP exhibits a superior trade-off between prediction performance and fairness with negligibly computation overhead. 1A naive way for many existing works (e.g., adding fair regularization, adversarial debiasing, et.al.) to obtain the influence of sensitive attribute is to train fair and unfair model with/without the sensitive attribute information, and then get the prediction difference. Therefore, the required resources includes training data and additional (unfair) model training. 2Similar with the goal of model explainability, only achieving accurate prediction is insufficient, and chasing explainability can help experts understand how the model provide prediction and convince users. 3Decision tree is intrinsic explainable while deep neural networks is not. 2 PRELIMINARIES:  2.1 NOTATIONS: We adopt bold upper-case letters to denote matrix such as X, bold lower-case letters such as x to denote vectors, calligraphic font such as X to denote set. Given a matrix X \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, the i-th row and j-th column are denoted as Xi and X\u00b7,j , and the element in i-th row and j-th column is Xi,j . We use the Frobenius norm, l1 norm of matrix X as ||X||F = \u221a\u2211 i,j X 2 i,j and ||X||1 = \u2211 ij |Xij |, respectively. Given two matrices X,Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, the inner product is defined as \u27e8X,Y\u27e9 = tr(X\u22a4Y), where tr(\u00b7) is the trace of a square matrix. SF (X) represents softmax function with a default normalized column dimension. Let G = {V, E} be a graph with the node set V = {v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vn} and the undirected edge set E = {e1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em}, where n,m represent the number of node and edge, respectively. The graph structure G can be represented as an adjacent matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, where Aij = 1 if existing edge between node vi and node vj . N (i) denotes the neighbors of node vi and N\u0303 (i) = N (i) \u222a {vi} denotes the self-inclusive neighbors. Suppose that each node is associated with a d-dimensional feature vector and a (binary) sensitive attribute, the feature for all nodes and sensitive attribute are denoted as Xori = Rn\u00d7d and s \u2208 {\u22121, 1}n. Define the sensitive attribute incident vector as \u2206s = 1>0(s) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 1>0(\u2212s) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 to normalize each sensitive attribute group, where 1>0(s) is an element-wise indicator function. 2.2 GNNS AS GRAPH SIGNAL DENOISING: A GNN model is usually composed of several stacking GNN layers. Given a graph G with N nodes, a GNN layer typically contains feature transformation Xtrans = ftrans(Xori) and aggregation Xagg = fagg(Xtrans|G), where Xori \u2208 Rn\u00d7din , Xtrans,Xagg \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout represent the input and output features. The feature transformation operation transforms the node feature dimension, and feature aggregation, updates node features based on neighbors\u2019 features and graph topology. Recent works (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a) have established the connections between many feature aggregation operations in representative GNNs and a graph signal denoising problem with Laplacian regularization. Here, we only introduce GCN/SGC as an examples to show the connection from a perspective of graph signal denoising. The more discussions are elaborated in Appendix G. Feature aggregation in Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Simplifying Graph Convolutional Network (SGC) is given by Xagg = A\u0303Xtrans, where A\u0303 = D\u0303\u2212 1 2 A\u0302D\u0303\u2212 1 2 is a normalized self-loop adjacency matrix A\u0302 = A+ I, and D\u0303 is degree matrix of A\u0303. Recent works (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a) provably demonstrate that such feature aggregation is equivalent to one-step gradient descent to minimize tr(F\u22a4 ( I\u2212 A\u0303)F ) with initialization F = Xtrans. 3 FAIR MESSAGE PASSING: In this section, we propose a new message passing scheme to aggregate useful information from neighbors while debiasing representation bias. Specifically, we formulate fair message passing as an optimization problem to pursue smoothness and fair node representation simultaneously. Together with an effective and efficient optimization algorithm, we derive the closed-form fair message passing. Finally, the proposed FMP is shown to be integrated in fair GNNs at three stages, including transformation, aggregation, and debiasing step, as shown in Figure 1. 3.1 THE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK: To achieve graph smoothness prior and fairness in the same process, a reasonable message passing should be a good solution for the following optimization problem: min F \u03bbs 2 tr(FT L\u0303F) + 1 2 ||F\u2212Xtrans||2F\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 hs(F) +\u03bbf ||\u2206sSF (F)||1\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 hf ( \u2206sSF (F) ) . (1) where L\u0303 represents normalized Laplacian matrix, hs(\u00b7) and hf (\u00b7) denotes the smoothness and fairness objectives 4, respectively, and Xtrans \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout is the transformed dout-dimensional node features and F \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout is the aggregated node features of the same matrix size. The first two terms preserve the similarity of connected node representation and thus enforces graph smoothness. The last term enforces fair node representation so that the average predicted probability between groups of different sensitive attributes can remain constant. The regularization coefficients \u03bbs and \u03bbf adaptively control the trade-off between graph smoothness and fairness. Smoothness objective hs(\u00b7). The adjacent matrix in existing graph message passing schemes is normalized for improving numerical stability and achieving superior performance. Similarly, the graph smoothness term requires normalized Laplacian matrix, i.e., L\u0303 = I\u2212A\u0303, A\u0303 = D\u0302\u2212 12 A\u0302D\u0302\u2212 12 , and A\u0302 = A+ I. From edge-centric view, smoothness objective enforces connected node representation to be similar since tr(FT L\u0303F) = \u2211 (vi,vj)\u2208E || Fi\u221a di+1 \u2212 Fj\u221a dj+1 ||2F , where di = \u2211 k Aik represents the degree of node vi. Fairness objective hf (\u00b7). The fairness objective measures the bias for node representation after aggregation. Recall sensitive attribute incident vector \u2206s indicates the sensitive attribute group and group size via the sign and absolute value summation. Recall that the sensitive attribute incident vector as \u2206s = 1>0(s) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 1>0(\u2212s) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 and SF (F) represents the predicted probability for node classification task, where SF (F)ij = P\u0302 (yi = j|X). Furthermore, we can show that our fairness objective is actually equivalent to demographic parity, i.e., ( \u2206sSF (F) )) j = P\u0302 (yi = j|si = 1,X) \u2212 P\u0302 (yi = j|si = \u22121,X). Please see proof in Appendix B. In other words, our fairness objective, l1 norm of \u2206sSF (F) characterizes the predicted probability difference between two groups with different sensitive attribute. Therefore, our proposed optimization framework can pursue graph smoothness and fairness simultaneously. 3.2 ALGORITHM FOR FAIR MESSAGE PASSING: For smoothness objective, many existing popular message passing scheme can be derived based on gradient descent with appropriate step size choice (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a). However, directly computing the gradient of the fairness term makes the closed-form gradient complicated since the gradient of l1 norm involves the sign of elements in the vector. 3.2.1 BI-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM FORMULATION.: To solve this optimization problem in a more effective and efficient manner, Fenchel conjugate (Rockafellar, 2015) is introduced to transform the original problem as bi-level optimization problem. Fenchel conjugate (Rockafellar, 2015) (a.k.a. convex conjugate) is the key tool to transform the original problem into bi-level optimization problem. For the general convex function h(\u00b7), its conjugate function is defined as h\u2217(U) \u25b3 = sup X \u27e8U,X\u27e9 \u2212 h(X). Based on Fenchel conjugate, the fairness objective can be transformed as variational representation hf (p) = sup u \u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2212 h\u2217f (u), where p = \u2206sSF (F) \u2208 R1\u00d7dout is a predicted probability vector for classification. Furthermore, the original optimization problem is equivalent to min F max u hs(F) + \u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2212 h\u2217f (u) (2) where u \u2208 R1\u00d7dout and h\u2217f (\u00b7) is the conjugate function of fairness objective hf (\u00b7). 3.2.2 PROBLEM SOLUTION: Motivated by Proximal Alternating Predictor-Corrector (PAPC) (Loris & Verhoeven, 2011; Chen et al., 2013), the min-max optimization problem (2) can be solved by the following fixed-point 4Such smoothness objetive is the the most common-used one in existing methods (Ma et al., 2021b; Belkin & Niyogi, 2001; Kalofolias, 2016). The various other smoothness objectives could be considered to improve the performance of FMP and we leave it for future work. equations { F = F\u2212\u2207hs(F)\u2212 \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F , u = proxh\u2217f ( u+\u2206sSF (F) ) . (3) where proxh\u2217f (u) = argminy ||y \u2212 u|| 2 F + h \u2217 f (u). Similar to \u201cpredictor-corrector\" algorithm (Loris & Verhoeven, 2011), we adopt iterative algorithm to find saddle point for min-max optimization problem. Specifically, starting from (Fk,uk), we adopt a gradient descent step on primal variable F to arrive (F\u0304k+1,uk) and then followed by a proximal ascent step in the dual variable u. Finally, a gradient descent step on primal variable in point (F\u0304k+1,uk) to arrive at (Fk+1,uk). In short, the iteration can be summarized as F\u0304k+1 = Fk \u2212 \u03b3\u2207hs(Fk)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,u k\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk , uk+1 = prox\u03b2h\u2217f ( uk + \u03b2\u2206sSF (F\u0304 k+1) ) , F\u0304k+1 = Fk \u2212 \u03b3\u2207hs(Fk)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,u k+1\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk . (4) where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are the step size for primal and dual variables. Note that the close-form for \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout and prox\u03b2h\u2217f (\u00b7) are still not clear, we will provide the solution one by one. Proximal Operator. As for the proximal operators, we provide the close-form in the following proposition: Proposition 1 (Proximal Operators) The proximal operators prox\u03b2h\u2217f (u) satisfies prox\u03b2h\u2217f (u)j = sign(u)j min ( |uj |, \u03bbf ) , (5) where sign(\u00b7) and \u03bbf are element-wise sign function and hyperparameter for fairness objective. In other words, such proximal operator is element-wise projection onto l\u221e ball with radius \u03bbf . FMP Scheme. Similar to works (Ma et al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2021), choosing \u03b3 = 11+\u03bbs and \u03b2 = 12\u03b3 , we have Fk \u2212 \u03b3\u2207hs(Fk) = ( (1\u2212 \u03b3)I\u2212 \u03b3\u03bbsL\u0303 ) Fk + \u03b3Xtrans = \u03b3Xtrans + (1\u2212 \u03b3)A\u0303Fk, (6) Therefore, we can summarize the proposed FMP as two phases, including propagation with skip connection (Step \u2776) and bias mitigation (Steps \u2777-\u277a). For bias mitigation, Step \u2777 updates the aggregated node features for fairness objective; Steps \u2778 and \u2779 aim to learn and \u201creshape\" perturbation vector in probability space, respectively. Step \u277a explicitly mitigate the bias of node features based on gradient descent on primal variable. The mathematical formulation is given as follows: Xk+1agg = \u03b3Xtrans + (1\u2212 \u03b3)A\u0303Xk, Step \u2776 F\u0304k+1 = Xk+1agg \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,uk\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk , Step \u2777 u\u0304k+1 = uk + \u03b2\u2206sSF (F\u0304 k+1), Step \u2778 uk+1 = min ( |u\u0304k+1|, \u03bbf ) \u00b7 sign(u\u0304k+1), Step \u2779 Fk+1 = Xk+1agg \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202\u27e8p,uk+1\u27e9 \u2202F \u2223\u2223\u2223 Fk . Step \u277a where Xk+1agg represents the node features with normal aggregation and skip connection with the transformed input Xtrans. 3.2.3 GRADIENT COMPUTATION ACCELERATION: The softmax property is also adopted to accelerate the gradient computation. Note that p = \u2206sSF (F) and SF (\u00b7) represents softmax over column dimension, directly computing the gradient \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F based on chain rule involves the three-dimensional tensor \u2202p\u2202F with gigantic computation complexity. Instead, we simplify the gradient computation based on the property of softmax function in the following theorem. Theorem 1 (Gradient Computation) The gradient over primal variable \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F satisfies \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202F = Us \u2299 SF (F)\u2212 Sum1(Us \u2299 SF (F))SF (F). (7) where Us \u25b3 = \u2206\u22a4s u, \u2299 represents element-wise product and Sum1(\u00b7) represents the summation over column dimension with preserved matrix shape. 3.3 DISCUSSION ON FMP: In this section, we provide the interpretation and analyze the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of proposed FMP scheme. Specifically, we interprete FMP as two phrases, including conventional aggregation and bias mitigation, and the computation complexity of FMP is lower than backward gradient calculation. Interpretation Note that the gradient of fairness objective over node features F satisfies \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F = \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202SF (F) \u2202SF (F) \u2202F and \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202SF (F) = \u2206 \u22a4 s u, such gradient calculation can be interpreted as three steps: Softmax transformation, perturbation in probability space, and debiasing in representation space. Specifcally, we first map the node representation into probability space via softmax transformation. Subsequently, we calculate the gradient of fairness objective in probability space. It is seen that the perturbation \u2206\u22a4s u actually poses low-rank debiasing in probability space, where the nodes with different sensitive attribute embrace opposite perturbation. In other words, the dual variable u represents the perturbation direction in probability space. Finally, the perturbation in probability space will be transformed into representation space via Jacobian transformation \u2202SF (F)\u2202F . Transparency The proposed FMP explicitly uses the sensitive attribute information in Steps \u2777-\u277a during forward propagation. In other words, if we aims to identify the influence of sensitive attributes for FMP, it is sufficient to check the difference between the input and output for debiasing step. It is worth mentioning that the required information for identifying the influence of sensitive attributes are naturally from the forward propagation. However, for the fair model from existing works (e.g, adding regularization and adversarial debiasing), note that the sensitive attribute information is implicitly encoded in the well-trained model weight, the sensitive attribute perturbation inevitably lead to variability of well-trained model weight. Therefore, it is required to retrain the model for probing the influence of sensitive attribute perturbation. The key drawback of these methods is due to encoding the sensitive attributes information into well-trained model weights. From aditors\u2019 perspective, it is quite hard to identify the influence of sensitive attributes only given well-trained fair model. Instead, our designed FMP explicitly adopts the sensitive attribute information in the forward propagation process, which naturally avoid the dilemma that sensitive attributes are encoded into well-trained model weight. In a nutshell, FMP encompasses with higher transparency since (1) the sensitive attribute is explicitly adopted in forward propagation; (2) It is not necessary to retrain model for probing influence of sensitive attribute. Efficiency FMP is an efficient message passing scheme. The computation complexity for the aggregation (sparse matrix multiplications) is O(mdout), where m is the number of edges in the graph. For FMP, the extra computation mainly focus on the perturbation calculation, as shown in Theorem 1, with the computation complexity O(ndout). The extra computation complexity is negligible in that the number of nodes n is far less than the number of edges m in the real-world graph. Additionally, if directly adopting autograd to calculate the gradient via back propagation, we have to calculate the three-dimensional tensor \u2202p\u2202F with computation complexity O(n 2dout). In other words, thanks to the softmax property, we achieve an efficient fair message passing scheme. Effectiveness The proposed FMP explicitly achieves graphs smoothness prior and fairness via alternative gradient descent. In other words, the propagation and debiasing forward in a white-box manner and there is not any trainable weight during forwarding phrase. The effectiveness of the proposed FMP is also validated in the experiments on three real-world datasets. 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed FMP. We firstly validate that graph data with large sensitive homophily enhances bias in GNNs via synthetic experiments. Moreover, for experiments on real-world datasets, we introduce the experimental settings and then evaluate our proposed FMP compared with several baselines in terms of prediction performance and fairness metrics. 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS: Datasets. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets Pokec-z, Pokec-n, and NBA (Dai & Wang, 2021). Pokec-z and Pokec-n are sampled, based on province information, from a larger Facebook-like social network Pokec (Takac & Zabovsky, 2012) in Slovakia, where region information is treated as the sensitive attribute and the predicted label is the working field of the users. NBA dataset is extended from a Kaggle dataset 5 consisting of around 400 NBA basketball players. The information of players includes age, nationality, and salary in the 2016-2017 season. The players\u2019 link relationships is from Twitter with the official crawling API. The binary nationality (U.S. and overseas player) is adopted as the sensitive attribute and the prediction label is whether the salary is higher than the median. Evaluation Metrics. We adopt accuracy to evaluate the performance of node classification task. As for fairness metric, we adopt two quantitative group fairness metrics to measure the prediction bias. According to works (Louizos et al., 2015; Beutel et al., 2017), we adopt demographic parity \u2206DP = |P(y\u0302 = 1|s = \u22121) \u2212 P(y\u0302 = 1|s = 1)| and equal opportunity \u2206EO = |P(y\u0302 = 1|s = 5https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba Pokec-n Pokec-z NBA \u22121, y = 1)\u2212 P(y\u0302 = 1|s = 1, y = 1)|, where y and y\u0302 represent the ground-truth label and predicted label, respectively. Baselines. We compare our proposed FMP with representative GNNs, such as GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GAT (Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), and APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2019), and MLP. For all models, we train 2 layers neural networks with 64 hidden units for 300 epochs. Additionally, We also compare adversarial debiasing and adding demographic regularization methods to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Implementation Details. We run the experiments 5 times and report the average performance for each method. We adopt Adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate and 10\u22125 weight decay for all models. For adversarial debiasing, we adopt train classifier and adversary with 70 and 30 epochs, respectively. The hyperparameter for adversary loss is tuned in {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0}. For adding regularization, we adopt the hyperparameter set {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, 80.0, 100.0}. 4.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: Comparison with existng GNNs. The accuracy, demographic parity and equal opportunity metrics of proposed FMP for Pokec-z, Pokec-n, NBA dataset are shown in Table 1 compared with MLP, GAT, GCN, SGC and APPNP. The detailed statistical information for these three dataset is shown in Table 3. From these results, we can obtain the following observations: \u2022 Many existing GNNs underperorm MLP model on all three datasets in terms of fairness metric. For instance, the demographic parity of MLP is lower than GAT, GCN, SGC and APPNP by 32.64%, 50.46%, 66.53% and 58.72% on Pokec-z dataset. The higher prediction bias comes from the aggregation within the-same-sensitive-attribute nodes and topology bias in graph data. \u2022 Our proposed FMP consistently achieve lowest prediction bias in terms of demographic parity and equal opportunity on all datasets. Specifically, FMP reduces demographic parity by 49.69%, 56.86% and 5.97% compared with the lowest bias among all baselines in Pokec-z, Pokec-n, and NBA dataset. Meanwhile, our proposed FMP achieves the best accuracy in NBA dataset, and comparable accuracy in Pokec-z and Pokec-n datasets. In a nutshell, proposed FMP can effectively mitigate prediction bias while preserving the prediction performance. Comparison with adversarial debiasing and regularization. To validate the effectiveness of proposed FMP, we also show the prediction performance and fairness metric trade-off compared with fairness-boosting methods, including adversarial debiasing (Fisher et al., 2020) and adding regularization (Chuang & Mroueh, 2020). Similar to (Louppe et al., 2017), the output of GNNs is the input of adversary and the goal of adversary is to predict the node sensitive attribute. We also adopt several backbones for these two methods, including MLP, GCN, GAT and SGC. We randomly split 50%/25%/25% for training, validation and test dataset. Figure 2 shows the pareto optimality curve for all methods, where right-bottom corner point represents the ideal performance (highest accuracy and lowest prediction bias). From the results, we list the following observations as follows: \u2022 Our proposed FMP can achieve better DP-Acc trade-off compared with adversarial debiasing and adding regularization for many GNNs and MLP. Such observation validates the effectiveness of the key idea in FMP: aggregation first and then debiasing. Additionally, FMP can reduce demographic parity with negligible performance cost due to transparent and efficient debiasing. \u2022 Message passing in GNNs does matter. For adding regularization or adversarial debiasing, different GNNs embrace huge distinctionwhich implies that appropriate message passing manner potentially leads to better trade-off performance. Additionally, many GNNs underperforms MLP in low label homophily coefficient dataset, such as NBA. The rationale is that aggregation may not always bring benefit in terms of accuracy when the neighbors have low probability with the same label. 5 RELATED WORKS: Graph neural networks. GNNs generalizing neural networks for graph data have already been shown great success for various real-world applications. There are two streams in GNNs model design, i.e., spectral-based and spatial-based. Spectral-based GNNs provide graph convolution definition based on graph theory, which is utilized in GNN layers together with feature transformation (Bruna et al., 2013; Defferrard et al., 2016; Henaff et al., 2015). Graph convolutional networks (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017) simplifies spectral-based GNN model into spatial aggregation scheme. Since then, many spatial-based GNNs variant are developed to update node representation via aggregating its neighbors\u2019 information, including graph attention network (GAT) (Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2018), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2019), et al (Gao et al., 2018; Monti et al., 2017). Graph signal denoising is another perspective to understand GNNs. Recently, there are several works show that GCN is equivalent to the first-order approximation for graph denoising with Laplacian regularization (Henaff et al., 2015; Zhao & Akoglu, 2019). The unified optimization framework are provided to unify many existing message passing schemes (Ma et al., 2021b; Zhu et al., 2021a). Fairness-aware learning on graphs. Many works have been developed to achieve fairness in machine learning community (Jiang et al., 2022; Chuang & Mroueh, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; Du et al., 2021; Yurochkin & Sun, 2020; Creager et al., 2019; Feldman et al., 2015). A pilot study on fair node representation learning is developed based on random walk (Rahman et al., 2019). Additionally, adversarial debiasing is adopt to learn fair prediction or node representation so that the well-trained adversary can not predict the sensitvie attribute based on node representation or prediction (Dai & Wang, 2021; Bose & Hamilton, 2019; Fisher et al., 2020). A Bayesian approach is developed to learn fair node representation via encoding sensitive information in prior distribution in (Buyl & De Bie, 2020). Work (Ma et al., 2021a) develops a PAC-Bayesian analysis to connect subgroup generalziation with accuracy parity. (Laclau et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021) aim to mitigate prediction bias for link prediction. Fairness-aware graph contrastive learning are proposed in (Agarwal et al., 2021; K\u00f6se & Shen, 2021). However, aforementioned works ignore the requirement of transparency in fairness. In this work, we develop an efficient and transparent fair message passing scheme explicitly rendering sensitive attribute usage. 6 CONCLUSION: In this work, we consider fairness problem from a new perspective, named transparency, i.e., the influence of sensitive attribute should be easily probed to public. We point out that existing fairness model in graph lack of transparency due to implicitly encoding sensitive attribute information in welltrained model weight. Additionally, integrated in a unified optimization framework, we develop an efficient, effective and transparent FMP to learn fair node representations while preserving prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines in node classification tasks. B PROOF ON FAIRNESS OBJECTIVE: The fairness objective can be shown as the average prediction probability difference as follows:( \u2206sSF (F) )) j = [ 1>0(s) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 1>0(\u2212s) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 ]( SF (F) ) :,j = \u2211 si=1 P\u0302 (yi = j|X) ||1>0(s)||1 \u2212 \u2211 si=\u22121 P\u0302 (yi = j|X) ||1>0(\u2212s)||1 = P\u0302 (yi = j|si = 1,X)\u2212 P\u0302 (yi = j|si = \u22121,X). C PROOF OF THEOREM 1: Before providing in-depth analysis on the gradient computation, we first introduce the softmax function derivative property in the following lemma: Lemma 1 For the softmax function with N -dimensional vector input y = SF (x) : R1\u00d7N \u2212\u2192 R1\u00d7N , where yj = e xj\u2211N k=1 e xk for \u2200j \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}, the derivative N \u00d7 N Jocobian matrix is defined by [\u2202y\u2202x ]ij = \u2202yi \u2202xj . Additionally, Jocobian matrix satisfies \u2202y\u2202x = yIN \u2212 y \u22a4y, where IN represents N \u00d7N identity matrix and \u22a4 denotes the transpose operation for vector or matrix. Proof: Considering the gradient \u2202yi\u2202xj for arbitrary ij, according to quotient and chain rule of derivatives, we have \u2202yi \u2202xj = exi \u2211N k=1 e xk \u2212 exi+xj(\u2211N k=1 e xk )2 = exi\u2211N k=1 e xk \u00b7 \u2211N k=1 e xk \u2212 exi\u2211N k=1 e xk = yi(1\u2212 yj), (8) Similarly, for arbitrary i \u0338= j, the gradient is given by \u2202yi \u2202xj = exi\u2211N k=1 e xk \u00b7 \u2212e xi\u2211N k=1 e xk = \u2212yiyj . (9) Combining these two cases, it is easy to verify the Jocobian matrix satisfies \u2202y\u2202x = yIN \u2212 y \u22a4y. \u25a1 Arming with the derivative property of softmax function, we further investigate the gradient \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F , where p = \u2206sSF (F) \u2208 R1\u00d7dout and SF (\u00b7) and u \u2208 R1\u00d7dout is independent with F \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout . Considering softmax function SF (x) \u2208 Rn\u00d7d is row-wise adopted in node representation matrix, the gradient satisfies \u2202SF (F)i\u2202Fj = 0dout\u00d7dout for i \u0338= j. Note that the inner product \u27e8p,u\u27e9 = \u2211dout k=1 pkuk, it is easy the obtain the gradient [\u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F ]ij = \u2211dout k=1 \u2202pk \u2202Fij uk. To simply the current notation, we denote F\u0303 \u25b3 = SF (F). According to chain rule of derivative, we have \u2202pk \u2202Fij = dout\u2211 t=1 \u2202pk \u2202F\u0303tk \u2202F\u0303tk \u2202Fij = dout\u2211 t=1 \u2206s,t \u2202F\u0303tk \u2202Fij (a) = \u2206s,i \u2202F\u0303ik \u2202Fij (b) = \u2206s,iF\u0303ik[\u03b4kj \u2212 F\u0303ij ], (10) where \u03b4kj is Dirac function (equals 1 only if k = j, otherwise 0;), equality (a) holds since softmax function is row-wise operation, and equality (b) is based on Lemma 1. Furthermore, we can obtain the gradient of fairness objective w.r.t. node presentation as follows: [ \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202F ]ij = dout\u2211 k=1 \u2202pk \u2202Fij uk = dout\u2211 k=1 \u2206s,iF\u0303ik[\u03b4kj \u2212 F\u0303ij ]uk = \u2206s,iF\u0303ijuj \u2212\u2206s,iF\u0303ij dout\u2211 k=1 F\u0303ikuk. (11) Therefore, the matrix formulation is given by \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9 \u2202F = Us \u2299 SF (F)\u2212 Sum1(Us \u2299 SF (F))SF (F). (12) where Us \u25b3 = \u2206\u22a4s u \u2208 Rn\u00d7dout and Sum1(\u00b7) represents the summation over column dimension with preserved matrix shape. Therefore, the computation complexity for gradient \u2202\u27e8p,u\u27e9\u2202F is O(ndout). D PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1: We firstly show the conjugate function for general norm function f(x) = \u03bb||x||, where x \u2208 R1\u00d7dout . The conjugate function of f(x) satisfies f\u2217(y) = { 0, ||x||\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb, +\u221e, ||x||\u2217 > \u03bb. (13) where ||x||\u2217 is dual norm of the original norm ||x||, defined as ||y||\u2217 = max ||x||\u22641 y\u22a4x. Considering the conjugate function definition f\u2217(y) = max x y\u22a4x\u2212\u03bb||x|| the analysis can be divided as the following two cases: \u2776 If ||y||\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb, according to the definition of dual norm, we have y\u22a4x \u2264 ||x||||y||\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb||x|| for \u2200||x||, where the equality holds if and only if ||x|| = 0. Hence, it is easy to obtain f\u2217(y) = max x y\u22a4x\u2212 \u03bb||x|| = 0. \u2777 If ||y||\u2217 > \u03bb, note that the dual norm ||y||\u2217 = max ||x||\u22641 y\u22a4x > \u03bb, there exists variables x\u0302 so that ||x\u0302|| \u2264 1 and x\u0302\u22a4y < \u03bb. Therefore, for any constant t, we have f\u2217(y) \u2265 y\u22a4(tx) \u2212 \u03bb||tx|| = t(y\u22a4x\u2212 \u03bb||x||) t\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 \u221e. Based on aforementioned two cases, it is easy to get the conjugate function for l1 norm (the dual norm is l\u221e), i.e., the conjugate function for hf (x) = \u03bb||x||1 is given by h\u2217f (y) = { 0, ||x||\u221e \u2264 \u03bb, +\u221e, ||x||\u221e > \u03bb. (14) Given the conjugate function h\u2217f (\u00b7), we further investigate the proximal operators proxh\u2217f . Note that proxh\u2217f (u) = argminy ||y \u2212 u|| 2 F + h \u2217 f (u) = arg min||y||\u221e\u2264\u03bbf ||y \u2212 u||2F = arg min yj\u2264\u03bbf \u2200j\u2208[dout] \u2211dout j=1 |yj \u2212 uj |2, the proximal operator problem can be decomposed as element-wise sub-problem, i.e., proxh\u2217f (u)j = arg minyj\u2264\u03bbf |yj \u2212 uj |2 = sign(uj)min(|uj |, \u03bbf ) which completes the proof. E TRAINING ALGORITHMS: We summarize the training algorithm for FMP and provide the pseudo codes in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: FMP Training Algorithm Input :Graph dataset =(X,A,Y); The total epochs T ; Hyperparameters \u03bbs and \u03bbf . Output :The well-trained FMP model. 1 for epoch from 1 to T do 2 Conduct feature transformation using MLP; 3 Conduct propagation and debiasing as steps \u2776-\u277a; 4 Calculate the cross entropy loss for node classification task; 5 Conduct back propagation step to update model weight; 6 end F DATASET STATISTICS: For fair comparison with previous work, we perform the node classification task on three real-world dataset, including Pokec-n, Pokec-z, and NBA. The data statistical information on three real-world dataset is provided in Table 3. It is seen that the sensitive homophily are even higher than label homophily coefficient among three real-world dataset, which validates that the real-world dataset are usually with large topology bias. G MORE DISCUSSION ON GNNS AS GRAPH SIGNAL DENOISING: In this section, we provide more examples to show many existing GNNs can be interpreted as graph signal denoising problem, including GAT and APPNP. GAT. Feature aggregation in GAT applies the normalized attention coefficient to compute a linear combination of neighbor\u2019s features as Xagg,i = \u2211 j\u2208N (i) \u03b1ijXtrans,j , where \u03b1ij = softmaxj(eij), eij = LeakyReLU(X\u22a4trans,iwi + X \u22a4 trans,jwj), and wi and wj are learnable column vectors. Prior study (Ma et al., 2021b) demonstrates that one-step gradient descent with adaptive step size 1\u2211 j\u2208N\u0303(i)(ci+cj) for the following objective problem: PPNP / APPNP. Feature aggregation in PPNP and APPNP adopt the aggregation rules as Xagg = \u03b1 ( I \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)A\u0303 )\u22121 Xtrans and Xk+1agg = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)A\u0303Xkagg + \u03b1Xtrans. It is shown that they are equivalent to the exact solution and one gradient descent step with stepsize \u03b12 to minimize the following objective problem: min F ||F\u2212Xtrans||2F + ( 1 \u03b1 \u2212 1)tr ( F\u22a4(I\u2212 A\u0303)F ) . H MORE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: H.1 MORE EXPERIMENTAL SETTING DETAILS In FMP implementation, we first use 2 layers MLP with 64 hidden units and the output dimension for MLP is 2. We also stack 2 layers for propagation and debiasing steps, where there is not any trainable model parameters. As for the model training, we adopt cross entropy loss function with 300 epochs. We also adopt Adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate and 1 \u00d7 105 weight decay for all models. The hyperprameters for FMP is \u03bbf = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 100} and \u03bbs = {0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20} . H.2 COMPARISON WITH FAIR MIXUP We also implement Fair mixup (Chuang & Mroueh, 2021) as the additional baseline for different GNN backbones in Figure 3. Note that input fair mixup requires calculating model prediction for mixed input batch, it is non-trivial to adopt input fair mixup in our experiments (node classification task) since forward propagation in GNN aggregates information from neighborhoods while the neighborhood information for the mixed input batch is missing. Therefore, we adopt manifold fair mixup for the logit layer (the previous layers contain aggregation step) in our experiments. Experimental results show that our method can still achieve better accuracy-fairness tradeoff performance on three datasets. H.3 SENSITIVE ATTRIBUTE INFLUENCE PROBE As for lending fairness perceptron, it represents the influence of sensitive attributes could be identified. For example, our proposed FMP includes three steps, i.e., transformation, aggregation and debiasing, where the sensitive attribute explicitly adopted in debiasing step. If we aims to identify the influence of sensitive attributes for FMP, it is sufficient to check the difference between the input and output for debiasing step. It is worth mentioning that the required information for identifying the influence of sensitive attributes are naturally from the forward propagation. Additionally, if we aim to identify the influence of sensitive attributes for existing methods (e.g, adding regularization and adversarial debiasing), the well-trained fair model is insufficient and we need additional vanilla (unfair) model without using any sensitive attribute information. In other words, these methods require model retraining with sensitive attribute removement and thus much more resources for sensitive attributes influence auditing. The key drawback of these methods is due to encoding the sensitive attributes information into well-trained model weights. From auditors\u2019 perspective, it is quite hard to identify the influence of sensitive attributes only given well-trained fair model. Instead, our designed FMP explicitly adopts the sensitive attribute information in the forward propagation process, which naturally avoid the dilemma that sensitive attributes are encoded into well-trained model weight. Figure 4 shows the visualization results for training with/without (left/right) sensitive attribute for FMP and several baselines (with GCN backbones) across three real-world datasets. From the visualization results, we observe that all methods with sensitive attribute information achieve better fairness since the logit layer representation for different sensitive attributes are mixed with each other. Therefore, it is hard to identify the sensitive attribute based on the representation and thus leads to higher fairness results. The key different is that the results for training with/without (left/right) sensitive attribute in FMP can both obtained through the forward propagation, while the other baseline methods requiring model retraining to probe the influence of sensitive attributes. H.4 RUNNING TIME COMPARISON We provide running time comparison in Figure 5 for our proposed FMP and other baselines, including vanilla, regularization and adversarial debiasing on many backbones (MLP, GCN, GAT, SGC, and APPNP). To achieve fair comparison, we adopt the same Adam optimizer with 200 epochs with 5 running times. We list several observations as follows: \u2022 The running time of proposed FMP is very efficient for large-scale dataset. Specifically, for vanilla method, the running time of FMP is higher than most lighten backbone MLP with 46.97% and 15.03% time overhead on Pokec-n and Poken-z dataset, respectively. Compared with the most timeconsumption APPNP, the running time of FMP is lower with 64.07% and 41.45% time overhead on Pokec-n and Poken-z dataset, respectively. \u2022 The regularization method achieves almost the same running time compared with vanilla method on all backbones. For example, GCN with regularization encompasses higher running time with 6.41% time overhead compared with vanilla method. Adversarial debiasing is extremely time-consuming. For example, GCN with adversarial debiasing encompasses higher running time with 88.58% time overhead compared with vanilla method. H.5 HYPERPARAMETER STUDY We provide hyperparameter study for further investigation on fairness and smoothness hyperparmeter on prediction and fairness performance on three datasets. Specifically, we tune hyperparameters as \u03bbf = {0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 100.0, 1000.0} and \u03bbs = {0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0}. From the results in Figure 6, we can make the following observations: \u2022 The accuracy and demographic parity are extremely sensitive to smoothness hyperparameter. It is seen that, for Pokec-n and Pokec-z datasets (NBA), larger smoothness hyperparameter usually leads to higher (lower) accuracy with higher prediction bias. The rationale is that, only for graph data with high label homophily coefficient, GCN-like aggregation with skip connection is beneficial. Otherwise, the neighbor\u2019s node representation with different label will mislead representation update. \u2022 The appropriate fairness hyperparameter leads to better fairness and prediction performance tradeoff. The reason is that fairness hyperparameter determinates the perturbation vector update step size in probability space. Only appropriate step size can lead to better perturbation vector update. I BROADER SOCIAL IMPACT AND LIMITATIONS: Transparency is an advanced property in fairness domain and poses huge challenging for research and industrial. Many existing works mainly rely on specific fairness metric to evaluate the prediction bias. The transparency may stimulates maintainers and auditors of machine learning system to rethink the fairness evaluation/auditing. Only achieving fair model with lower bias for specific fairness metric is insufficient. The maintainers should also consider how to leverage the influence of sensitive attribute for auditors. The transparency may lead maintainers pay more effects in improving the transparency of fair model and could be helpful to convince the auditors. The limitations of this work are that it requests sensitive information in the inference stage."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Arxiv search reveals a related paper, \"FMP: Toward Fair Graph Message Passing against Topology Bias\" (Jiang et al., 2022).

Since I don't have the full paper to review, this evaluation will be based on the title and a general understanding of current research trends in these domains. I will infer likely approaches and challenges.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation: 'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency'\\n\\n**Overall Premise:** The title suggests an innovative approach that aims to embed fairness principles directly into the message passing mechanism of GNNs, while simultaneously ensuring or leveraging transparency. This is a highly relevant and impactful research direction given the increasing use of GNNs in high-stakes domains and the growing demand for responsible AI.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 1. Novelty and Significance of the 'Transparency' Concept\\n\\n**Inferred Approach:**\\nThe \\\"transparency\\\" aspect could manifest in several ways:\\n1.  **Interpretability for Fairness:** Using existing or novel GNN explanation methods (e.g., attention weights, subgraph explanations, feature importance) to *diagnose* and *understand* fairness issues.\\n2.  **Built-in Transparency:** Modifying the message passing mechanism itself to explicitly track or disentangle the influence of sensitive attributes or specific nodes/features, making their contribution to predictions more observable.\\n3.  **Transparency as a Regularizer:** Introducing a term in the loss function that penalizes opaque or biased message flows, or encourages more \\\"interpretable\\\" representations related to fairness.\\n4.  **Counterfactual Transparency:** Allowing users to query \\\"what if\\\" scenarios regarding sensitive attributes and observe changes in message passing or predictions.\\n\\n**Novelty:**\\n*   **High Potential:** Merely combining \\\"fairness\\\" and \\\"transparency\\\" in GNNs isn't *entirely* new, as many fairness papers also include some interpretability component. However, the novelty hinges on *how* transparency is defined and integrated:\\n    *   **If transparency is framed as the ability to clearly observe and control the *flow of sensitive attribute information* through message passing:** This would be highly novel. Most GNN interpretability focuses on general prediction explanations, not specifically how sensitive attributes propagate or get amplified/mitigated.\\n    *   **If a *new, quantifiable measure* of GNN message passing transparency specifically tied to fairness is introduced:** This would be a significant contribution.\\n    *   **If the method proposes a *novel architectural modification* or *training objective* that intrinsically embeds transparency for fairness into the GNN's operation (not just post-hoc explanation):** This would move beyond typical interpretability tools and be genuinely novel.\\n\\n**Significance:**\\n*   **Bridging Explainability and Fairness:** A successful approach could provide a powerful framework for not just *auditing* GNNs for bias, but for *designing* them to be intrinsically fairer and more accountable.\\n*   **Targeted Debiasing:** If transparency reveals *where* and *how* bias arises in the message passing, it enables more precise and effective debiasing interventions, rather than relying on black-box regularization.\\n*   **Trust and Adoption:** Greater transparency in how sensitive decisions are made by GNNs can foster greater trust from users, regulators, and affected communities, facilitating wider adoption of GNNs in critical applications.\\n*   **Debugging and Iteration:** Allows developers to more easily debug fairness issues during model development and iterate on their debiasing strategies.\\n\\n**Constructive Feedback on Transparency:**\\n*   **Clear Definition:** The paper must rigorously define what \\\"transparency\\\" means *in the context of graph message passing and fairness*. Is it about seeing which nodes contribute? Which features? Which sensitive attributes? How their influence propagates? Be precise.\\n*   **Quantification:** How is transparency measured? Is it a metric? A visualization technique? How can its effectiveness be objectively evaluated?\\n*   **Scope:** Does transparency apply to the entire GNN, or specific layers/mechanisms? Does it focus on individual predictions, or group-level behavior?\\n*   **User Perspective:** Consider who the \\\"user\\\" of this transparency is (developer, regulator, affected individual) and tailor the transparency mechanism to their needs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. Rigor of the Fairness Objective\\n\\n**Inferred Approach:**\\nThe paper will likely adopt one or more standard group fairness definitions (e.g., Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Equal Opportunity) or potentially individual fairness. The optimization might involve:\\n*   Adding a regularization term to the GNN's loss function.\\n*   Pre-processing techniques to de-bias the graph structure or features.\\n*   Post-processing techniques on the GNN's outputs.\\n*   Adversarial training to learn fair representations.\\n\\n**Rigor Checklist:**\\n1.  **Clear Definition and Justification:**\\n    *   **Definition:** Is the chosen fairness objective clearly defined mathematically?\\n    *   **Justification:** Why is *this specific* fairness definition appropriate for the chosen task and dataset? Different definitions have different implications (e.g., Demographic Parity can hinder utility, Equalized Odds is often preferred for classification tasks with protected attributes).\\n2.  **Multi-Dimensional Fairness:**\\n    *   Does the paper consider multiple sensitive attributes?\\n    *   Does it address intersectional fairness (e.g., fairness for elderly women vs. young men)? This is a significant challenge for GNNs due to feature interaction.\\n3.  **Trade-offs:**\\n    *   Does the paper rigorously analyze the trade-off between fairness and model utility (accuracy, AUC, etc.)? A truly fair model might sometimes sacrifice some predictive power. This trade-off needs to be quantified and discussed.\\n    *   Does it analyze trade-offs with transparency (e.g., a highly transparent model might be less performant)?\\n4.  **Robustness and Generalization:**\\n    *   How robust is the fairness achievement to noise in the graph, changes in sensitive attribute distribution, or different network architectures?\\n    *   Does the method generalize to different types of graphs and tasks?\\n5.  **Benchmarking:**\\n    *   Does it compare against state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNN methods?\\n    *   Are the fairness metrics evaluated comprehensively (e.g., not just one threshold but across the ROC curve for classification)?\\n6.  **Theoretical Guarantees (Bonus):** While difficult, any theoretical guarantees on the achieved fairness properties or the propagation of bias would significantly enhance rigor.\\n\\n**Constructive Feedback on Fairness Objective:**\\n*   **Contextualize Fairness:** Explicitly state the societal implications of the chosen fairness definition for the specific application (e.g., loan applications, recommender systems, social network analysis).\\n*   **Beyond Group Fairness:** If applicable, consider exploring individual fairness (e.g., similar individuals should receive similar outcomes, regardless of protected attributes), which is more challenging but often more ethically robust.\\n*   **Data Bias:** Discuss how biases *in the input graph data* (structural bias, feature bias) are handled or acknowledged, as GNNs can amplify these.\\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Use a diverse set of fairness metrics and present them clearly, ideally with confidence intervals or statistical significance tests.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. Ethical Implications of the Approach\\n\\n**Positive Ethical Implications:**\\n*   **Increased Trust and Accountability:** By making GNN decisions more understandable and fair, the approach can build trust with users and stakeholders, and enable easier accountability mechanisms when unfair outcomes occur.\\n*   **Reduced Harm:** Fairer GNNs can lead to more equitable access to resources, opportunities, or information, thereby mitigating societal biases and preventing harm to vulnerable groups.\\n*   **Regulatory Compliance:** The ability to demonstrate fairness and explain decisions helps organizations comply with emerging AI regulations (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act) and anti-discrimination laws.\\n*   **Informed Decision-Making:** For practitioners, understanding *why* a GNN is fair or unfair allows for more informed and responsible deployment decisions.\\n\\n**Potential Negative/Challenging Ethical Implications:**\\n*   **False Sense of Security / Fairwashing:** If the transparency is superficial or the fairness objective is too narrow, the method might provide a *false sense of security*, making stakeholders believe the system is fair when underlying issues persist. This is \\\"fairwashing.\\\"\\n*   **Misinterpretation of Transparency:** Complex transparency mechanisms can be misinterpreted by non-experts, leading to incorrect conclusions about fairness.\\n*   **Privacy Concerns:** If transparency involves revealing *how* specific sensitive attributes (e.g., health data, sexual orientation) influence decisions, it could inadvertently expose private information, especially in settings where these attributes are implicit or inferred.\\n*   **Fairness Trade-offs:** The method might achieve fairness according to one definition but exacerbate unfairness according to another, or significantly degrade overall utility, leading to an ethical dilemma.\\n*   **Adversarial Manipulation:** A highly transparent system might be more vulnerable to adversarial attacks that specifically target the transparent mechanisms to induce biased outcomes or evade detection.\\n*   **\\\"What-if\\\" Abuse:** If the transparency allows for \\\"what-if\\\" scenarios, it could be misused to game the system or to profile individuals based on sensitive attributes in ways that are ethically problematic.\\n*   **The \\\"Unfairness\\\" of Fairness:** Sometimes, making a system \\\"fair\\\" for one group might feel \\\"unfair\\\" to another (e.g., if a previous bias benefited a majority group). This societal tension should be acknowledged.\\n\\n**Constructive Feedback on Ethical Implications:**\\n*   **Proactive Ethical Analysis:** The paper should not just list positive implications but also proactively identify and discuss potential ethical pitfalls and how the proposed method attempts to mitigate them.\\n*   **Transparency of Transparency:** Explain the limitations of the transparency method itself. What *can't* it explain?\\n*   **User Interface/Experience for Transparency:** If the transparency is meant for human consumption, consider the ethical implications of its design and potential for misinterpretation.\\n*   **Long-term Societal Impact:** Briefly discuss the broader societal impact of deploying such fair and transparent GNNs, acknowledging that technology alone cannot solve societal biases.\\n*   **Data Source Ethics:** While potentially out of scope, a brief acknowledgment of the ethical implications of the *source data* used for training and evaluation would be valuable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Overall Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe paper 'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency' addresses a crucial intersection of GNNs, fairness, and interpretability. Its success hinges on the **rigor of its definitions** for both \\\"transparency\\\" and \\\"fairness,\\\" and the **novelty of its integration strategy**. If it can truly embed meaningful and quantifiable transparency related to sensitive attribute flow within GNN message passing, and demonstrate this effectively alongside robust fairness objectives and careful consideration of ethical implications, it has the potential to be a highly significant contribution to responsible AI.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.2325978\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"FairnessAdvocateAgent\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper 'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency'.

The proposed FMP scheme, bi-level optimization framework, and gradient computation acceleration are key technical contributions that warrant detailed analysis.\\n\\n### 1. Technical Soundness of the FMP Scheme\\n\\nThe core idea of FMP appears to be centered around modulating message passing to achieve fairness and transparency. This typically involves learning specific \\\"message weights\\\" that control the influence of neighbors' information, especially concerning sensitive attributes.\\n\\n**Potential Strengths:**\\n*   **Direct Control Point:** Modifying message passing is a very direct and intuitive way to intervene in a GNN's information flow. Since GNNs are fundamentally built on message passing, controlling this mechanism offers a fine-grained approach to fairness.\\n*   **Targeted Intervention:** Rather than globally re-weighting nodes or post-processing predictions, message re-weighting allows for localized adjustments, potentially preserving more useful information from non-sensitive features or non-biased interactions.\\n*   **Interpretability through Weights:** If the scheme learns explicit message weights ($w_{uv}$ for message from $u$ to $v$), these weights *can* serve as a form of transparency. Higher weights imply stronger influence, lower weights imply weaker. This could indicate which connections are being \\\"attenuated\\\" to reduce bias. For example, if messages from nodes of a certain sensitive group are systematically down-weighted when they contribute to bias, this could be observed.\\n\\n**Areas for Critical Evaluation (Potential Weaknesses/Questions):**\\n*   **Definition of \\\"Transparency\\\":** What specific aspect of transparency does FMP provide? Is it:\\n    *   **Feature Importance:** Which features of neighbors are most influential?\\n    *   **Decision Path Explanation:** How does a node's prediction propagate through specific messages?\\n    *   **Bias Attribution:** Which specific messages/neighbors are causing bias, and how are they being corrected?\\n    The paper needs to clearly define \\\"transparency\\\" and demonstrate how the learned weights fulfill this definition beyond just showing their values. For instance, is there an analysis of *why* certain weights are high or low (e.g., correlation with specific sensitive attributes, or how they align with a counterfactual explanation)?\\n*   **Granularity of Weights:** Are the weights learned per edge, per edge type, per sensitive group pair, or based on node features?\\n    *   **Per-edge weights ($w_{uv}$):** Can be very expressive but lead to a huge parameter space for large graphs, posing scalability challenges during learning. Also, what if an edge is not seen during training? Generalization to unseen edges is a concern.\\n    *   **Weights learned by a function:** If $w_{uv}$ is computed by a small neural network $f(h_u, h_v, \\\\text{sensitive\\\\_attr}_u, \\\\text{sensitive\\\\_attr}_v)$, this is more scalable and generalizable, but the transparency might be less direct (you'd be interpreting the function $f$ rather than raw weights).\\n*   **Impact on Graph Structure and Connectivity:** Artificially re-weighting messages could effectively \\\"disconnect\\\" or \\\"weaken\\\" paths in the graph. While this is intended for fairness, it could inadvertently:\\n    *   **Lead to Under-smoothing:** If important structural information is lost by aggressive down-weighting.\\n    *   **Degrade Task Performance:** If the re-weighting mechanism removes discriminative but non-biased information.\\n    *   **Create New Biases:** Could implicitly create new biases if the re-weighting mechanism itself has blind spots or over-corrects.\\n*   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Does the FMP scheme genuinely address the *causal* pathways of bias, or merely mitigate the *correlation* between sensitive attributes and predictions? True fairness often requires counterfactual reasoning or causal inference, which is a much harder problem than just correlation reduction. The message weights might reflect correlations rather than underlying causal mechanisms.\\n*   **Applicability to Diverse GNN Architectures:** Is the FMP scheme general enough to be applied to different GNN variants (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, etc.) or is it tied to a specific message passing formulation?\\n\\n### 2. Validity of the Optimization Framework\\n\\nThe mention of a \\\"bi-level optimization formulation\\\" is a significant design choice. This typically means there's an outer optimization loop controlling the message weights (or parameters that generate them) to achieve fairness, and an inner optimization loop training the GNN parameters (e.g., aggregation functions, transformation matrices) given the current message weights to optimize for the primary task (e.g., node classification).\\n\\n**Potential Strengths:**\\n*   **Decoupling Objectives:** Bi-level optimization naturally decouples the fairness objective from the primary task objective. This allows for a more principled way to ensure fairness as a meta-objective that guides the learning of intervention mechanisms (message weights).\\n*   **Meta-Learning Perspective:** It aligns well with meta-learning, where the model learns how to adapt its internal mechanisms (message passing) to achieve a desired meta-objective (fairness).\\n*   **Flexibility:** Can incorporate various fairness metrics into the outer loss.\\n\\n**Areas for Critical Evaluation (Potential Weaknesses/Questions):**\\n*   **Computational Complexity:** Bi-level optimization is notoriously expensive. Computing gradients for the outer loop often requires implicit differentiation (e.g., using the Implicit Function Theorem) or unrolling the inner optimization loop. This typically involves computing second-order derivatives (Hessians or Hessian-vector products), which can be computationally prohibitive for large GNNs and graphs.\\n*   **Convergence Guarantees and Stability:** Bi-level optimization problems are generally non-convex and non-smooth. Proving convergence guarantees is challenging, and in practice, they can be highly sensitive to hyperparameters (learning rates for both inner and outer loops, number of inner loop iterations). The framework needs to demonstrate practical stability and convergence.\\n*   **Choice of Inner and Outer Loss Functions:**\\n    *   **Inner Loss ($L_{cls}$):** Standard cross-entropy or MSE is typical.\\n    *   **Outer Loss ($L_{fair}$):** How is the fairness objective quantified and integrated? If it's directly based on fairness metrics like Disparate Impact (DI), Equal Opportunity (EO), or Demographic Parity (DP), these are often non-differentiable (e.g., absolute difference of probabilities) or only piecewise differentiable. The paper must specify how $L_{fair}$ is made differentiable (e.g., using smooth approximations, reparameterization tricks, or adversarial setups).\\n    *   **Trade-off parameter:** How is the balance between $L_{cls}$ and $L_{fair}$ managed? Is it a fixed $\\\\lambda$, or an adaptive mechanism?\\n*   **Local Optima:** Due to non-convexity, the optimization can easily get stuck in poor local optima. Does the paper discuss strategies to mitigate this (e.g., multiple initializations, specific optimization algorithms)?\\n*   **Role of Sensitive Attributes:** Are sensitive attributes used in the inner loop, outer loop, or both? If used in the inner loop, it directly guides the GNN. If only in the outer loop, the inner loop GNN is \\\"agnostic,\\\" and the outer loop adjusts the messaging to correct for bias, which is a more robust approach to fairness.\\n\\n### 3. Efficiency of Gradient Computation Acceleration\\n\\nGiven the inherent complexity of bi-level optimization, an efficient gradient computation strategy is crucial for the practical applicability of FMP. This is a significant technical contribution if handled effectively.\\n\\n**Potential Strengths:**\\n*   **Necessity:** Without acceleration, such a framework would likely be intractable for real-world graph sizes. Any valid acceleration method makes the entire proposal more feasible.\\n*   **Potential for Novelty:** Depending on the specific method, it could offer new insights into optimizing complex GNN training procedures.\\n\\n**Areas for Critical Evaluation (Potential Weaknesses/Questions):**\\n*   **Specific Acceleration Method:** What specific technique is employed? Common approaches include:\\n    *   **First-Order Approximation (e.g., MAML-like):** Approximating the inner loop's convergence by a single or few gradient steps, thus avoiding higher-order derivatives. This dramatically reduces computational cost but can lead to less optimal solutions or slower convergence for the outer loop. Is the approximation justified for this specific problem structure?\\n    *   **KKT Conditions Simplification:** For constrained optimization, using KKT conditions and implicit differentiation can be simplified if the inner problem has certain properties (e.g., strong convexity, linearity).\\n    *   **Conjugate Gradient / Neumann Series Approximation:** For computing inverse-Hessian vector products (which arise from implicit differentiation), iterative methods can approximate them without explicitly forming the Hessian.\\n    *   **Stochastic/Batching Techniques:** Using mini-batches for gradient computation can accelerate training, but specific care must be taken in bi-level settings.\\n*   **Theoretical Guarantees vs. Empirical Performance:** Does the acceleration method come with any theoretical guarantees regarding the quality of the gradients or the convergence properties? Or is it purely an empirical speedup? Does the approximation compromise the final performance (fairness or accuracy)?\\n*   **Scalability Analysis:** How does the computational complexity scale with:\\n    *   Number of nodes ($N$) and edges ($M$)?\\n    *   Feature dimensions ($D$)?\\n    *   Number of GNN layers ($L$)?\\n    *   Number of sensitive attributes?\\n    The paper should provide a detailed complexity analysis and empirical benchmarks showing the speedup compared to a naive bi-level approach.\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Higher-order derivatives and unrolling large computations can lead to high memory usage. Does the acceleration also address memory efficiency?\\n*   **Impact on Solution Quality:** Sometimes, aggressive approximations for speed can lead to suboptimal solutions or failure to converge to satisfactory fairness levels. Is there an ablation study demonstrating the trade-off between acceleration and the achieved fairness/accuracy?\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe \\\"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\\\" paper proposes an interesting and relevant approach to tackling bias in GNNs while providing insights into the fairness mechanism. The technical core relies on three interconnected pillars:\\n1.  **FMP Scheme:** Modulating message passing for fairness and transparency. This is a promising direction, but the precise definition of transparency and the scalability of per-edge weights need careful consideration.\\n2.  **Bi-level Optimization:** A powerful but complex framework for integrating the fairness objective, requiring careful handling of computational costs and convergence.\\n3.  **Gradient Computation Acceleration:** Essential for practical implementation, but the specific approximation chosen will dictate its effectiveness and potential impact on solution quality.\\n\\nTo provide a definitive positive evaluation, the paper would need to robustly address the outlined questions, particularly regarding the formal definition and empirical validation of \\\"transparency,\\\" the stability and convergence properties of the bi-level optimization, and a thorough analysis of the trade-offs introduced by the gradient acceleration method. Empirical results across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, coupled with strong ablation studies, would be crucial to substantiate the claims.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.2316036\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"GNNMethodologyExpertAgent\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper 'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency'.

Thoroughness of the Experimental Setup\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning & Reporting:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Often, hyperparameter tuning is briefly mentioned or fixed across all datasets/baselines without justification. This can lead to suboptimal performance for baselines or an unfair comparison.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Clearly state the hyperparameter search space and strategy (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization). Report the final hyperparameters for each dataset and model. Ensure baselines are run with their *optimal* reported settings or tuned specifically for the comparison.\\n*   **Reproducibility:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Lack of public code, detailed training procedures, or explicit random seeds.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Provide a link to the codebase (e.g., GitHub) with clear instructions. Specify all random seeds used for initialization, data splitting, and training. Document the exact computational environment (e.g., PyTorch/TensorFlow version, GPU type).\\n*   **Statistical Significance:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Reporting only average metrics without standard deviations or confidence intervals across multiple runs. No statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to confirm significant differences.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Run all experiments with multiple independent random seeds (e.g., 5-10) and report mean and standard deviation. Use appropriate statistical tests to compare performance between the proposed method and baselines, highlighting statistically significant improvements.\\n*   **Baseline Selection:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Not including state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines for *each* of the paper's objectives (fairness, transparency, and standard GNN performance).\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   **Fairness Baselines:** Include a diverse set of fair GNN baselines (e.g., adversarial debiasing GNNs, post-processing methods for GNNs, graph-rewiring approaches for fairness, pre-processing methods that modify features/structure).\\n        *   **Transparency Baselines:** Compare against established GNN explanation methods (e.g., GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, GNN-LRP, attention-based explanations).\\n        *   **Standard GNN Baselines:** Include strong non-fair/non-transparent GNNs (e.g., GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) to show the performance cost of fairness/transparency.\\n        *   **Non-GNN Baselines (if applicable):** If the fairness or transparency mechanisms could be generalized, consider non-graph baselines to show the advantage of the graph context.\\n*   **Computational Cost Analysis:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Often overlooked for complex methods.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Report training time, inference time, and memory footprint for the proposed method and key baselines. Discuss the scalability of the approach, especially for larger graphs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of Datasets\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Diversity of Datasets:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Relying solely on small, homophilous citation networks (e.g., Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed). These may not fully represent real-world graph complexities.\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   Include larger-scale datasets (e.g., OGB-series, Reddit, Flickr) to test scalability and performance on more complex structures.\\n        *   Include datasets with varying degrees of homophily/heterophily (e.g., Actors, Chameleon, Squirrel) to assess robustness.\\n        *   Include social networks, biological networks, or other domain-specific graphs to demonstrate wider applicability.\\n*   **Protected Attribute Definition:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Using synthetic protected attributes without clear justification or realistic generation mechanisms. If real attributes are used, their source and ethical implications might not be fully discussed.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Clearly explain how protected attributes are defined or extracted for each dataset. If synthetic, justify the generation process (e.g., based on node features, degree, community) and explore different distributions (balanced vs. imbalanced). If real, acknowledge potential biases in the dataset and discuss ethical considerations.\\n*   **Handling of Multiple Protected Attributes:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Most fairness research focuses on a single protected attribute. Real-world scenarios often involve intersectional fairness.\\n    *   **Improvement:** If feasible, evaluate the method's ability to handle multiple, potentially correlated, protected attributes simultaneously. This adds significant depth.\\n*   **Data Splitting Strategy:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Fixed train/validation/test splits, which might not be robust.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Consider K-fold cross-validation, especially for smaller datasets, to ensure robustness across different splits. For larger graphs, clearly define the node splitting strategy (e.g., random, time-based, community-based).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Appropriateness of Evaluation Metrics\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Fairness Metrics:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Relying on a single fairness metric (e.g., Demographic Parity Difference) without considering other definitions or potential trade-offs.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Employ a comprehensive suite of fairness metrics:\\n        *   **Group Fairness:** Demographic Parity Difference (DPD), Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD), Average Odds Difference (AOD), Disparate Impact (DI). Justify the choice of primary fairness metric based on the problem context.\\n        *   **Individual Fairness:** If the method aims for individual fairness, use metrics like consistency or Lipschitz continuity.\\n        *   **Trade-offs:** Explicitly report and visualize the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Plotting accuracy vs. fairness metric on a Pareto front for different hyperparameter settings or methods is highly informative.\\n*   **Transparency/Explainability Metrics:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** This is often the weakest point. Qualitative examples are good, but quantitative metrics for \\\"transparency\\\" are harder and often insufficient.\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   **Quantitative Faithfulness:** Metrics like Fidelity, AOPC (Area Over Perturbation Curve), or Sparsity can quantify how well explanations reflect model decisions or how concise they are.\\n        *   **Robustness of Explanations:** Evaluate the stability of explanations to small perturbations in input.\\n        *   **Human Evaluation (Crucial!):** True \\\"transparency\\\" often requires human comprehensibility.\\n            *   **Weakness:** Lack of user studies or human subject experiments.\\n            *   **Improvement:** Conduct small-scale user studies where human evaluators assess the comprehensibility, trustworthiness, or usefulness of the generated explanations for simple cases.

I will infer likely approaches and challenges.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation: \\'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\\'\\n\\n**Overall Premise:** The title suggests an innovative approach that aims to embed fairness principles directly into the message passing mechanism of GNNs, while simultaneously ensuring or leveraging transparency. This is a highly relevant and impactful research direction given the increasing use of GNNs in high-stakes domains and the growing demand for responsible AI.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 1. Novelty and Significance of the \\'Transparency\\' Concept\\n\\n**Inferred Approach:**\\nThe \"transparency\" aspect could manifest in several ways:\\n1.  **Interpretability for Fairness:** Using existing or novel GNN explanation methods (e.g., attention weights, subgraph explanations, feature importance) to *diagnose* and *understand* fairness issues.\\n2.  **Built-in Transparency:** Modifying the message passing mechanism itself to explicitly track or disentangle the influence of sensitive attributes or specific nodes/features, making their contribution to predictions more observable.\\n3.  **Transparency as a Regularizer:** Introducing a term in the loss function that penalizes opaque or biased message flows, or encourages more \"interpretable\" representations related to fairness.\\n4.  **Counterfactual Transparency:** Allowing users to query \"what if\" scenarios regarding sensitive attributes and observe changes in message passing or predictions.\\n\\n**Novelty:**\\n*   **High Potential:** Merely combining \"fairness\" and \"transparency\" in GNNs isn\\'t *entirely* new, as many fairness papers also include some interpretability component. However, the novelty hinges on *how* transparency is defined and integrated:\\n    *   **If transparency is framed as the ability to clearly observe and control the *flow of sensitive attribute information* through message passing:** This would be highly novel. Most GNN interpretability focuses on general prediction explanations, not specifically how sensitive attributes propagate or get amplified/mitigated.\\n    *   **If a *new, quantifiable measure* of GNN message passing transparency specifically tied to fairness is introduced:** This would be a significant contribution.\\n    *   **If the method proposes a *novel architectural modification* or *training objective* that intrinsically embeds transparency for fairness into the GNN\\'s operation (not just post-hoc explanation):** This would move beyond typical interpretability tools and be genuinely novel.\\n\\n**Significance:**\\n*   **Bridging Explainability and Fairness:** A successful approach could provide a powerful framework for not just *auditing* GNNs for bias, but for *designing* them to be intrinsically fairer and more accountable.\\n*   **Targeted Debiasing:** If transparency reveals *where* and *how* bias arises in the message passing, it enables more precise and effective debiasing interventions, rather than relying on black-box regularization.\\n*   **Trust and Adoption:** Greater transparency in how sensitive decisions are made by GNNs can foster greater trust from users, regulators, and affected communities, facilitating wider adoption of GNNs in critical applications.\\n*   **Debugging and Iteration:** Allows developers to more easily debug fairness issues during model development and iterate on their debiasing strategies.\\n\\n**Constructive Feedback on Transparency:**\\n*   **Clear Definition:** The paper must rigorously define what \"transparency\" means *in the context of graph message passing and fairness*. Is it about seeing which nodes contribute? Which features? Which sensitive attributes? How their influence propagates? Be precise.\\n*   **Quantification:** How is transparency measured? Is it a metric? A visualization technique? How can its effectiveness be objectively evaluated?\\n*   **Scope:** Does transparency apply to the entire GNN, or specific layers/mechanisms? Does it focus on individual predictions, or group-level behavior?\\n*   **User Perspective:** Consider who the \"user\" of this transparency is (developer, regulator, affected individual) and tailor the transparency mechanism to their needs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. Rigor of the Fairness Objective\\n\\n**Inferred Approach:**\\nThe paper will likely adopt one or more standard group fairness definitions (e.g., Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, Equal Opportunity) or potentially individual fairness. The optimization might involve:\\n*   Adding a regularization term to the GNN\\'s loss function.\\n*   Pre-processing techniques to de-bias the graph structure or features.\\n*   Post-processing techniques on the GNN\\'s outputs.\\n*   Adversarial training to learn fair representations.\\n\\n**Rigor Checklist:**\\n1.  **Clear Definition and Justification:**\\n    *   **Definition:** Is the chosen fairness objective clearly defined mathematically?\\n    *   **Justification:** Why is *this specific* fairness definition appropriate for the chosen task and dataset? Different definitions have different implications (e.g., Demographic Parity can hinder utility, Equalized Odds is often preferred for classification tasks with protected attributes).\\n2.  **Multi-Dimensional Fairness:**\\n    *   Does the paper consider multiple sensitive attributes?\\n    *   Does it address intersectional fairness (e.g., fairness for elderly women vs. young men)? This is a significant challenge for GNNs due to feature interaction.\\n3.  **Trade-offs:**\\n    *   Does the paper rigorously analyze the trade-off between fairness and model utility (accuracy, AUC, etc.)? A truly fair model might sometimes sacrifice some predictive power. This trade-off needs to be quantified and discussed.\\n    *   Does it analyze trade-offs with transparency (e.g., a highly transparent model might be less performant)?\\n4.  **Robustness and Generalization:**\\n    *   How robust is the fairness achievement to noise in the graph, changes in sensitive attribute distribution, or different network architectures?\\n    *   Does the method generalize to different types of graphs and tasks?\\n5.  **Benchmarking:**\\n    *   Does it compare against state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNN methods?\\n    *   Are the fairness metrics evaluated comprehensively (e.g., not just one threshold but across the ROC curve for classification)?\\n6.  **Theoretical Guarantees (Bonus):** While difficult, any theoretical guarantees on the achieved fairness properties or the propagation of bias would significantly enhance rigor.\\n\\n**Constructive Feedback on Fairness Objective:**\\n*   **Contextualize Fairness:** Explicitly state the societal implications of the chosen fairness definition for the specific application (e.g., loan applications, recommender systems, social network analysis).\\n*   **Beyond Group Fairness:** If applicable, consider exploring individual fairness (e.g., similar individuals should receive similar outcomes, regardless of protected attributes), which is more challenging but often more ethically robust.\\n*   **Data Bias:** Discuss how biases *in the input graph data* (structural bias, feature bias) are handled or acknowledged, as GNNs can amplify these.\\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Use a diverse set of fairness metrics and present them clearly, ideally with confidence intervals or statistical significance tests.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. Ethical Implications of the Approach\\n\\n**Positive Ethical Implications:**\\n*   **Increased Trust and Accountability:** By making GNN decisions more understandable and fair, the approach can build trust with users and stakeholders, and enable easier accountability mechanisms when unfair outcomes occur.\\n*   **Reduced Harm:** Fairer GNNs can lead to more equitable access to resources, opportunities, or information, thereby mitigating societal biases and preventing harm to vulnerable groups.\\n*   **Regulatory Compliance:** The ability to demonstrate fairness and explain decisions helps organizations comply with emerging AI regulations (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act) and anti-discrimination laws.\\n*   **Informed Decision-Making:** For practitioners, understanding *why* a GNN is fair or unfair allows for more informed and responsible deployment decisions.\\n\\n**Potential Negative/Challenging Ethical Implications:**\\n*   **False Sense of Security / Fairwashing:** If the transparency is superficial or the fairness objective is too narrow, the method might provide a *false sense of security*, making stakeholders believe the system is fair when underlying issues persist. This is \"fairwashing.\"\\n*   **Misinterpretation of Transparency:** Complex transparency mechanisms can be misinterpreted by non-experts, leading to incorrect conclusions about fairness.\\n*   **Privacy Concerns:** If transparency involves revealing *how* specific sensitive attributes (e.g., health data, sexual orientation) influence decisions, it could inadvertently expose private information, especially in settings where these attributes are implicit or inferred.\\n*   **Fairness Trade-offs:** The method might achieve fairness according to one definition but exacerbate unfairness according to another, or significantly degrade overall utility, leading to an ethical dilemma.\\n*   **Adversarial Manipulation:** A highly transparent system might be more vulnerable to adversarial attacks that specifically target the transparent mechanisms to induce biased outcomes or evade detection.\\n*   **\"What-if\" Abuse:** If the transparency allows for \"what-if\" scenarios, it could be misused to game the system or to profile individuals based on sensitive attributes in ways that are ethically problematic.\\n*   **The \"Unfairness\" of Fairness:** Sometimes, making a system \"fair\" for one group might feel \"unfair\" to another (e.g., if a previous bias benefited a majority group). This societal tension should be acknowledged.\\n\\n**Constructive Feedback on Ethical Implications:**\\n*   **Proactive Ethical Analysis:** The paper should not just list positive implications but also proactively identify and discuss potential ethical pitfalls and how the proposed method attempts to mitigate them.\\n*   **Transparency of Transparency:** Explain the limitations of the transparency method itself. What *can\\'t* it explain?\\n*   **User Interface/Experience for Transparency:** If the transparency is meant for human consumption, consider the ethical implications of its design and potential for misinterpretation.\\n*   **Long-term Societal Impact:** Briefly discuss the broader societal impact of deploying such fair and transparent GNNs, acknowledging that technology alone cannot solve societal biases.\\n*   **Data Source Ethics:** While potentially out of scope, a brief acknowledgment of the ethical implications of the *source data* used for training and evaluation would be valuable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Overall Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe paper \\'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\\' addresses a crucial intersection of GNNs, fairness, and interpretability. Its success hinges on the **rigor of its definitions** for both \"transparency\" and \"fairness,\" and the **novelty of its integration strategy**. If it can truly embed meaningful and quantifiable transparency related to sensitive attribute flow within GNN message passing, and demonstrate this effectively alongside robust fairness objectives and careful consideration of ethical implications, it has the potential to be a highly significant contribution to responsible AI.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.2325978}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'As an expert in Graph Neural Networks and optimization techniques, I will critically evaluate the technical aspects of the \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" (FMP) scheme, assuming the common technical approaches for such a title, and highlight potential strengths, weaknesses, and areas for deeper scrutiny.\\n\\n## Critical Evaluation of \\'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\\'\\n\\nThe paper tackles the crucial and challenging problem of fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) while simultaneously aiming for transparency, which is a commendable goal. The proposed FMP scheme, bi-level optimization framework, and gradient computation acceleration are key technical contributions that warrant detailed analysis.\\n\\n### 1. Technical Soundness of the FMP Scheme\\n\\nThe core idea of FMP appears to be centered around modulating message passing to achieve fairness and transparency. This typically involves learning specific \"message weights\" that control the influence of neighbors\\' information, especially concerning sensitive attributes.\\n\\n**Potential Strengths:**\\n*   **Direct Control Point:** Modifying message passing is a very direct and intuitive way to intervene in a GNN\\'s information flow. Since GNNs are fundamentally built on message passing, controlling this mechanism offers a fine-grained approach to fairness.\\n*   **Targeted Intervention:** Rather than globally re-weighting nodes or post-processing predictions, message re-weighting allows for localized adjustments, potentially preserving more useful information from non-sensitive features or non-biased interactions.\\n*   **Interpretability through Weights:** If the scheme learns explicit message weights ($w_{uv}$ for message from $u$ to $v$), these weights *can* serve as a form of transparency. Higher weights imply stronger influence, lower weights imply weaker. This could indicate which connections are being \"attenuated\" to reduce bias. For example, if messages from nodes of a certain sensitive group are systematically down-weighted when they contribute to bias, this could be observed.\\n\\n**Areas for Critical Evaluation (Potential Weaknesses/Questions):**\\n*   **Definition of \"Transparency\":** What specific aspect of transparency does FMP provide? Is it:\\n    *   **Feature Importance:** Which features of neighbors are most influential?\\n    *   **Decision Path Explanation:** How does a node\\'s prediction propagate through specific messages?\\n    *   **Bias Attribution:** Which specific messages/neighbors are causing bias, and how are they being corrected?\\n    The paper needs to clearly define \"transparency\" and demonstrate how the learned weights fulfill this definition beyond just showing their values. For instance, is there an analysis of *why* certain weights are high or low (e.g., correlation with specific sensitive attributes, or how they align with a counterfactual explanation)?\\n*   **Granularity of Weights:** Are the weights learned per edge, per edge type, per sensitive group pair, or based on node features?\\n    *   **Per-edge weights ($w_{uv}$):** Can be very expressive but lead to a huge parameter space for large graphs, posing scalability challenges during learning. Also, what if an edge is not seen during training? Generalization to unseen edges is a concern.\\n    *   **Weights learned by a function:** If $w_{uv}$ is computed by a small neural network $f(h_u, h_v, \\\\text{sensitive\\\\_attr}_u, \\\\text{sensitive\\\\_attr}_v)$, this is more scalable and generalizable, but the transparency might be less direct (you\\'d be interpreting the function $f$ rather than raw weights).\\n*   **Impact on Graph Structure and Connectivity:** Artificially re-weighting messages could effectively \"disconnect\" or \"weaken\" paths in the graph. While this is intended for fairness, it could inadvertently:\\n    *   **Lead to Under-smoothing:** If important structural information is lost by aggressive down-weighting.\\n    *   **Degrade Task Performance:** If the re-weighting mechanism removes discriminative but non-biased information.\\n    *   **Create New Biases:** Could implicitly create new biases if the re-weighting mechanism itself has blind spots or over-corrects.\\n*   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Does the FMP scheme genuinely address the *causal* pathways of bias, or merely mitigate the *correlation* between sensitive attributes and predictions? True fairness often requires counterfactual reasoning or causal inference, which is a much harder problem than just correlation reduction. The message weights might reflect correlations rather than underlying causal mechanisms.\\n*   **Applicability to Diverse GNN Architectures:** Is the FMP scheme general enough to be applied to different GNN variants (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, etc.) or is it tied to a specific message passing formulation?\\n\\n### 2. Validity of the Optimization Framework\\n\\nThe mention of a \"bi-level optimization formulation\" is a significant design choice. This typically means there\\'s an outer optimization loop controlling the message weights (or parameters that generate them) to achieve fairness, and an inner optimization loop training the GNN parameters (e.g., aggregation functions, transformation matrices) given the current message weights to optimize for the primary task (e.g., node classification).\\n\\n**Potential Strengths:**\\n*   **Decoupling Objectives:** Bi-level optimization naturally decouples the fairness objective from the primary task objective. This allows for a more principled way to ensure fairness as a meta-objective that guides the learning of intervention mechanisms (message weights).\\n*   **Meta-Learning Perspective:** It aligns well with meta-learning, where the model learns how to adapt its internal mechanisms (message passing) to achieve a desired meta-objective (fairness).\\n*   **Flexibility:** Can incorporate various fairness metrics into the outer loss.\\n\\n**Areas for Critical Evaluation (Potential Weaknesses/Questions):**\\n*   **Computational Complexity:** Bi-level optimization is notoriously expensive. Computing gradients for the outer loop often requires implicit differentiation (e.g., using the Implicit Function Theorem) or unrolling the inner optimization loop. This typically involves computing second-order derivatives (Hessians or Hessian-vector products), which can be computationally prohibitive for large GNNs and graphs.\\n*   **Convergence Guarantees and Stability:** Bi-level optimization problems are generally non-convex and non-smooth. Proving convergence guarantees is challenging, and in practice, they can be highly sensitive to hyperparameters (learning rates for both inner and outer loops, number of inner loop iterations). The framework needs to demonstrate practical stability and convergence.\\n*   **Choice of Inner and Outer Loss Functions:**\\n    *   **Inner Loss ($L_{cls}$):** Standard cross-entropy or MSE is typical.\\n    *   **Outer Loss ($L_{fair}$):** How is the fairness objective quantified and integrated? If it\\'s directly based on fairness metrics like Disparate Impact (DI), Equal Opportunity (EO), or Demographic Parity (DP), these are often non-differentiable (e.g., absolute difference of probabilities) or only piecewise differentiable. The paper must specify how $L_{fair}$ is made differentiable (e.g., using smooth approximations, reparameterization tricks, or adversarial setups).\\n    *   **Trade-off parameter:** How is the balance between $L_{cls}$ and $L_{fair}$ managed? Is it a fixed $\\\\lambda$, or an adaptive mechanism?\\n*   **Local Optima:** Due to non-convexity, the optimization can easily get stuck in poor local optima. Does the paper discuss strategies to mitigate this (e.g., multiple initializations, specific optimization algorithms)?\\n*   **Role of Sensitive Attributes:** Are sensitive attributes used in the inner loop, outer loop, or both? If used in the inner loop, it directly guides the GNN. If only in the outer loop, the inner loop GNN is \"agnostic,\" and the outer loop adjusts the messaging to correct for bias, which is a more robust approach to fairness.\\n\\n### 3. Efficiency of Gradient Computation Acceleration\\n\\nGiven the inherent complexity of bi-level optimization, an efficient gradient computation strategy is crucial for the practical applicability of FMP. This is a significant technical contribution if handled effectively.\\n\\n**Potential Strengths:**\\n*   **Necessity:** Without acceleration, such a framework would likely be intractable for real-world graph sizes. Any valid acceleration method makes the entire proposal more feasible.\\n*   **Potential for Novelty:** Depending on the specific method, it could offer new insights into optimizing complex GNN training procedures.\\n\\n**Areas for Critical Evaluation (Potential Weaknesses/Questions):**\\n*   **Specific Acceleration Method:** What specific technique is employed? Common approaches include:\\n    *   **First-Order Approximation (e.g., MAML-like):** Approximating the inner loop\\'s convergence by a single or few gradient steps, thus avoiding higher-order derivatives. This dramatically reduces computational cost but can lead to less optimal solutions or slower convergence for the outer loop. Is the approximation justified for this specific problem structure?\\n    *   **KKT Conditions Simplification:** For constrained optimization, using KKT conditions and implicit differentiation can be simplified if the inner problem has certain properties (e.g., strong convexity, linearity).\\n    *   **Conjugate Gradient / Neumann Series Approximation:** For computing inverse-Hessian vector products (which arise from implicit differentiation), iterative methods can approximate them without explicitly forming the Hessian.\\n    *   **Stochastic/Batching Techniques:** Using mini-batches for gradient computation can accelerate training, but specific care must be taken in bi-level settings.\\n*   **Theoretical Guarantees vs. Empirical Performance:** Does the acceleration method come with any theoretical guarantees regarding the quality of the gradients or the convergence properties? Or is it purely an empirical speedup? Does the approximation compromise the final performance (fairness or accuracy)?\\n*   **Scalability Analysis:** How does the computational complexity scale with:\\n    *   Number of nodes ($N$) and edges ($M$)?\\n    *   Feature dimensions ($D$)?\\n    *   Number of GNN layers ($L$)?\\n    *   Number of sensitive attributes?\\n    The paper should provide a detailed complexity analysis and empirical benchmarks showing the speedup compared to a naive bi-level approach.\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Higher-order derivatives and unrolling large computations can lead to high memory usage. Does the acceleration also address memory efficiency?\\n*   **Impact on Solution Quality:** Sometimes, aggressive approximations for speed can lead to suboptimal solutions or failure to converge to satisfactory fairness levels. Is there an ablation study demonstrating the trade-off between acceleration and the achieved fairness/accuracy?\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" paper proposes an interesting and relevant approach to tackling bias in GNNs while providing insights into the fairness mechanism. The technical core relies on three interconnected pillars:\\n1.  **FMP Scheme:** Modulating message passing for fairness and transparency. This is a promising direction, but the precise definition of transparency and the scalability of per-edge weights need careful consideration.\\n2.  **Bi-level Optimization:** A powerful but complex framework for integrating the fairness objective, requiring careful handling of computational costs and convergence.\\n3.  **Gradient Computation Acceleration:** Essential for practical implementation, but the specific approximation chosen will dictate its effectiveness and potential impact on solution quality.\\n\\nTo provide a definitive positive evaluation, the paper would need to robustly address the outlined questions, particularly regarding the formal definition and empirical validation of \"transparency,\" the stability and convergence properties of the bi-level optimization, and a thorough analysis of the trade-offs introduced by the gradient acceleration method. Empirical results across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, coupled with strong ablation studies, would be crucial to substantiate the claims.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.2316036}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Given the paper title \\'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\\', I will evaluate it based on common practices and expectations for research at the intersection of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Fairness, and Explainability/Transparency. My assessment assumes the paper presents a novel method and aims to demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving both fairness and transparency in GNNs.\\n\\n### General Strengths (Assumed)\\n\\n1.  **Addresses a Critical Problem:** The intersection of GNNs, fairness, and transparency is a highly relevant and challenging area. GNNs are increasingly used in sensitive applications, making fairness and understanding their decisions paramount.\\n2.  **Multifaceted Objective:** The paper aims for a multi-objective optimization (accuracy, fairness, transparency), which is inherently complex and valuable.\\n\\n### Detailed Evaluation & Weaknesses/Improvements\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Thoroughness of the Experimental Setup\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning & Reporting:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Often, hyperparameter tuning is briefly mentioned or fixed across all datasets/baselines without justification. This can lead to suboptimal performance for baselines or an unfair comparison.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Clearly state the hyperparameter search space and strategy (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization). Report the final hyperparameters for each dataset and model. Ensure baselines are run with their *optimal* reported settings or tuned specifically for the comparison.\\n*   **Reproducibility:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Lack of public code, detailed training procedures, or explicit random seeds.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Provide a link to the codebase (e.g., GitHub) with clear instructions. Specify all random seeds used for initialization, data splitting, and training. Document the exact computational environment (e.g., PyTorch/TensorFlow version, GPU type).\\n*   **Statistical Significance:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Reporting only average metrics without standard deviations or confidence intervals across multiple runs. No statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to confirm significant differences.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Run all experiments with multiple independent random seeds (e.g., 5-10) and report mean and standard deviation. Use appropriate statistical tests to compare performance between the proposed method and baselines, highlighting statistically significant improvements.\\n*   **Baseline Selection:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Not including state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines for *each* of the paper\\'s objectives (fairness, transparency, and standard GNN performance).\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   **Fairness Baselines:** Include a diverse set of fair GNN baselines (e.g., adversarial debiasing GNNs, post-processing methods for GNNs, graph-rewiring approaches for fairness, pre-processing methods that modify features/structure).\\n        *   **Transparency Baselines:** Compare against established GNN explanation methods (e.g., GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, GNN-LRP, attention-based explanations).\\n        *   **Standard GNN Baselines:** Include strong non-fair/non-transparent GNNs (e.g., GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) to show the performance cost of fairness/transparency.\\n        *   **Non-GNN Baselines (if applicable):** If the fairness or transparency mechanisms could be generalized, consider non-graph baselines to show the advantage of the graph context.\\n*   **Computational Cost Analysis:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Often overlooked for complex methods.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Report training time, inference time, and memory footprint for the proposed method and key baselines. Discuss the scalability of the approach, especially for larger graphs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of Datasets\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Diversity of Datasets:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Relying solely on small, homophilous citation networks (e.g., Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed). These may not fully represent real-world graph complexities.\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   Include larger-scale datasets (e.g., OGB-series, Reddit, Flickr) to test scalability and performance on more complex structures.\\n        *   Include datasets with varying degrees of homophily/heterophily (e.g., Actors, Chameleon, Squirrel) to assess robustness.\\n        *   Include social networks, biological networks, or other domain-specific graphs to demonstrate wider applicability.\\n*   **Protected Attribute Definition:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Using synthetic protected attributes without clear justification or realistic generation mechanisms. If real attributes are used, their source and ethical implications might not be fully discussed.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Clearly explain how protected attributes are defined or extracted for each dataset. If synthetic, justify the generation process (e.g., based on node features, degree, community) and explore different distributions (balanced vs. imbalanced). If real, acknowledge potential biases in the dataset and discuss ethical considerations.\\n*   **Handling of Multiple Protected Attributes:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Most fairness research focuses on a single protected attribute. Real-world scenarios often involve intersectional fairness.\\n    *   **Improvement:** If feasible, evaluate the method\\'s ability to handle multiple, potentially correlated, protected attributes simultaneously. This adds significant depth.\\n*   **Data Splitting Strategy:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Fixed train/validation/test splits, which might not be robust.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Consider K-fold cross-validation, especially for smaller datasets, to ensure robustness across different splits. For larger graphs, clearly define the node splitting strategy (e.g., random, time-based, community-based).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Appropriateness of Evaluation Metrics\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Fairness Metrics:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Relying on a single fairness metric (e.g., Demographic Parity Difference) without considering other definitions or potential trade-offs.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Employ a comprehensive suite of fairness metrics:\\n        *   **Group Fairness:** Demographic Parity Difference (DPD), Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD), Average Odds Difference (AOD), Disparate Impact (DI). Justify the choice of primary fairness metric based on the problem context.\\n        *   **Individual Fairness:** If the method aims for individual fairness, use metrics like consistency or Lipschitz continuity.\\n        *   **Trade-offs:** Explicitly report and visualize the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Plotting accuracy vs. fairness metric on a Pareto front for different hyperparameter settings or methods is highly informative.\\n*   **Transparency/Explainability Metrics:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** This is often the weakest point. Qualitative examples are good, but quantitative metrics for \"transparency\" are harder and often insufficient.\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   **Quantitative Faithfulness:** Metrics like Fidelity, AOPC (Area Over Perturbation Curve), or Sparsity can quantify how well explanations reflect model decisions or how concise they are.\\n        *   **Robustness of Explanations:** Evaluate the stability of explanations to small perturbations in input.\\n        *   **Human Evaluation (Crucial!):** True \"transparency\" often requires human comprehensibility.\\n            *   **Weakness:** Lack of user studies or human subject experiments.\\n            *   **Improvement:** Conduct small-scale user studies where human evaluators assess the comprehensibility, trustworthiness, or usefulness of the generated explanations for simple cases. This provides strong evidence for the \"transparency\" claim.\\n        *   **Specificity of Explanation:** Clarify *what* aspects of the GNN (node features, edge connections, aggregation, specific layers) the transparency mechanism focuses on and ensure the metrics align with this.\\n*   **Multi-Objective Trade-offs Visualization:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Presenting separate tables for accuracy, fairness, and transparency metrics without showing their interdependencies.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Create multi-dimensional plots (e.g., 2D scatter plots showing Accuracy vs. Fairness, and Accuracy vs. Transparency) to illustrate the trade-off space and how the proposed method performs relative to baselines across these objectives. A 3D plot is even better if comprehensible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Robustness of Results\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses & Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Not exploring the method\\'s sensitivity to key parameters or data characteristics.\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Show how the results change when key hyperparameters of the proposed method are varied (e.g., fairness regularization strength, transparency regularization strength, learning rate).\\n        *   **Protected Attribute Ratio:** Analyze performance when the distribution of the protected attribute changes (e.g., highly imbalanced groups vs. more balanced groups).\\n        *   **Graph Perturbations:** Evaluate robustness to noise in graph structure (e.g., adding/removing random edges) or node features.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Not thoroughly demonstrating the contribution of each component of the proposed method.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Systematically remove or modify key components of the \"Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\" method (e.g., remove the fairness component, remove the transparency component, use a simpler message passing scheme) and show how performance degrades. This validates the necessity and effectiveness of each design choice.\\n*   **Generalizability:**\\n    *   **Weakness:** Limited scope of evaluation, potentially leading to overfitting to specific datasets or scenarios.\\n    *   **Improvement:**\\n        *   **Inductive vs. Transductive:** If applicable, evaluate performance in both transductive (all nodes known during training) and inductive (new nodes appear at test time) settings.\\n        *   **Task Versatility:** While likely focused on node classification, briefly discussing or hinting at applicability to other graph tasks (e.g., link prediction, graph classification) can strengthen generalizability claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper \\'Fair Graph Message Passing with Transparency\\' addresses a crucial and timely research challenge. To ensure its findings are robust, credible, and impactful, the experimental section needs to move beyond simple comparisons. A strong evaluation would involve:\\n\\n1.  **Rigorous statistical validation** of results.\\n2.  **Comprehensive baseline comparisons** that cover the multi-objective nature of the problem.\\n3.  **Diverse and challenging datasets** that reflect real-world complexities.\\n4.  **Multi-faceted and appropriate evaluation metrics**, especially for \"transparency\" which often requires human judgment.\\n5.  **In-depth analysis of trade-offs, sensitivities, and component contributions** through ablation and sensitivity studies.\\n\\nBy addressing these potential weaknesses, the paper can significantly enhance its scientific rigor and demonstrate a more convincing contribution to the field of fair and explainable AI on graphs.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.2307615}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The agent reviews provide valuable insights:\n\n*   **Fairness Advocate Agent:** Highlights the novelty and significance of the transparency concept but emphasizes the need for a rigorous definition and quantification of transparency.
