The paper title is: Pre-training via Denoising for Molecular Property Prediction\n\nNone: Many important problems involving molecular property prediction from 3D structures have limited data, posing a generalization challenge for neural networks. In this paper, we describe a pre-training technique based on denoising that achieves a new state-of-the-art in molecular property prediction by utilizing large datasets of 3D molecular structures at equilibrium to learn meaningful representations for downstream tasks. Relying on the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching, we show that the denoising objective corresponds to learning a molecular force field \u2013 arising from approximating the Boltzmann distribution with a mixture of Gaussians \u2013 directly from equilibrium structures. Our experiments demonstrate that using this pre-training objective significantly improves performance on multiple benchmarks, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the majority of targets in the widely used QM9 dataset. Our analysis then provides practical insights into the effects of different factors \u2013 dataset sizes, model size and architecture, and the choice of upstream and downstream datasets \u2013 on pre-training. 1 INTRODUCTION: The success of the best performing neural networks in vision and natural language processing (NLP) relies on pre-training the models on large datasets to learn meaningful features for downstream tasks (Dai & Le, 2015; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). For molecular property prediction from 3D structures (a point cloud of atomic nuclei in R3), the problem of how to similarly learn such representations remains open. For example, none of the best models on the widely used QM9 benchmark use any form of pre-training (e.g. Klicpera et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2022b; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021; Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022), in stark contrast with vision and NLP. Effective methods for pre-training could have a significant impact on fields such as drug discovery and material science. In this work, we focus on the problem of how large datasets of 3D molecular structures can be utilized to improve performance on downstream molecular property prediction tasks that also rely on 3D structures as input. We address the question: how can one exploit large datasets like PCQM4Mv2,1 that contain over 3 million structures, to improve performance on datasets such as DES15K that are orders of magnitude smaller? Our answer is a form of self-supervised pre-training that generates useful representations for downstream prediction tasks, leading to state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Inspired by recent advances in noise regularization for graph neural networks (GNNs) (Godwin et al., 2022), our pre-training objective is based on denoising in the space of structures (and is hence self-supervised). Unlike existing pre-training methods, which largely focus on 2D graphs, our approach targets the setting where the downstream task involves 3D point clouds defining the molecular structure. Relying on the well-known connection between denoising and score-matching (Vincent, 2011; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020), we show that the denoising objective is equivalent to learning a particular force field, adding a new interpretation of denoising in the context of molecules and shedding light on how it aids representation learning. The contributions of our work are summarized as follows: 1Note that PCQM4Mv2 is a new version of PCQM4M that now offers 3D structures. Private & Confidential \u2022 We investigate a simple and effective method for pre-training via denoising in the space of 3D structures with the aim of improving downstream molecular property prediction from such 3D structures. Our denoising objective is shown to be related to learning a specific force field. \u2022 Our experiments demonstrate that pre-training via denoising significantly improves performance on multiple challenging datasets that vary in size, nature of task, and molecular composition. This establishes that denoising over structures successfully transfers to molecular property prediction, setting, in particular, a new state-of-the-art on 10 out of 12 targets in the widely used QM9 dataset. Figure 1 illustrates performance on one of the targets in QM9. \u2022 We make improvements to a common GNN, in particular showing how to apply Tailored Activation Transformation (TAT) (Zhang et al., 2022) to Graph Network Simulators (GNS) (SanchezGonzalez et al., 2020), which is complementary to pre-training and further boosts performance. \u2022 We analyze the benefits of pre-training by gaining insights into the effects of dataset size, model size and architecture, and the relationship between the upstream and downstream datasets. 2 RELATED WORK: Pre-training of GNNs. Various recent works have formulated methods for pre-training using graph data (Liu et al., 2021b; Hu et al., 2020a; Xie et al., 2021; Kipf & Welling, 2016), rather than 3D point clouds of atom nuclei as in this paper. Approaches based on contrastive methods rely on learning representations by contrasting different views of the input graph (Sun et al., 2019; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2019; You et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a), or bootstrapping (Thakoor et al., 2021). Autoregressive or reconstruction-based approaches, such as ours, learn representations by requiring the model to predict aspects of the input graph (Hu et al., 2020a;b; Rong et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019). Most methods in the current literature are not designed to handle 3D structural information, focusing instead on 2D graphs. The closest work to ours is GraphMVP (Liu et al., 2021a), where 3D structure is treated as one view of a 2D molecule for the purpose of upstream contrastive learning. Their work focuses on downstream tasks that only involve 2D information, while our aim is to improve downstream models for molecular property prediction from 3D structures. After the release of this pre-print, similar ideas have been studied by Jiao et al. (2022) and Liu et al. (2022a). Denoising, representation learning and score-matching. Noise has long been known to improve generalization in machine learning (Sietsma & Dow, 1991; Bishop, 1995). Denoising autoencoders have been used to effectively learn representations by mapping corrupted inputs to original inputs (Vincent et al., 2008; 2010). Specific to GNNs (Battaglia et al., 2018; Scarselli et al., 2009; Bronstein et al., 2017), randomizing input graph features has been shown to improve performance (Hu et al., 2020a; Sato et al., 2021). Applications to physical simulation also involve corrupting the state with Gaussian noise (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2018; 2020; Pfaff et al., 2020). Our work builds on Noisy Nodes (Godwin et al., 2022), which incorporates denoising as an auxiliary task to improve performance, indicating the effectiveness of denoising for molecular property prediction (cf. Section 3.2.2). Denoising is also closely connected to score-matching (Vincent, 2011), which has become popular for generative modelling (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Hoogeboom et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2021). We also rely on this connection to show that denoising structures corresponds to learning a force field. Equivariant neural networks for 3D molecular property prediction. Recently, the dominant approach for improving models for molecular property prediction from 3D structures has been through the design of architectures that incorporate roto-translational inductive biases into the model, such that the outputs are invariant to translating and rotating the input atomic positions. A simple way to achieve this is to use roto-translation invariant features as inputs, such as inter-atomic distances (Sch\u00fctt et al., 2017; Unke & Meuwly, 2019), angles (Klicpera et al., 2020b;a; Shuaibi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b), or the principal axes of inertia (Godwin et al., 2022). There is also broad literature on equivariant neural networks, whose intermediate activations transform accordingly with roto-translations of inputs thereby naturally preserving inter-atomic distance and orientation information. Such models can be broadly categorized into those that are specifically designed for molecular property prediction (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021; Batzner et al., 2021; Anderson et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2020) and general-purpose architectures (Satorras et al., 2021; Finzi et al., 2020; Hutchinson et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2018; Kondor et al., 2018; Brandstetter et al., 2021). Our pre-training technique is architecture-agnostic, and we show that it can be applied to enhance performance in both a GNN-based architecture (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020) and a Transformer-based one (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022). We conjecture that similar improvements will hold for other models. 3 METHODOLOGY:  3.1 PROBLEM SETUP: Molecular property prediction consists of predicting scalar quantities given the structure of one or more molecules as input. Each data example is a labelled set specified as follows: we are provided with a set of atoms S = {(a1,p1), . . . , (a|S|,p|S|)}, where ai \u2208 {1, . . . , 118} and pi \u2208 R3 are the atomic number and 3D position respectively of atom i in the molecule, alongside a label y \u2208 R. We assume that the model, which takes S as input, is any architecture consisting of a backbone, which first processes S to build a latent representation of it, followed by a vertex-level or graph-level \u201cdecoder\u201d, that returns per-vertex predictions or a single prediction for the input respectively. 3.2 PRE-TRAINING VIA DENOISING: Given a dataset of molecular structures, we pre-train the network by denoising the structures, which operates as follows. Let Dstructures = {S1, . . . , Sn} denote the upstream dataset of equilibrium structures, and let GNN\u03b8 denote a graph neural network with parameters \u03b8 which takes S \u2208 Dstructures as input and returns per-vertex predictions GNN\u03b8(S) = (\u03f5\u03021, . . . , \u03f5\u0302|S|). The precise parameterization of the models we consider in this work is described in Section 3.3 and Appendix A. Starting with an input molecule S \u2208 Dstructures, we perturb it by adding i.i.d. Gaussian noise to its atomic positions pi. That is, we create a noisy version of the molecule: S\u0303 = {(a1, p\u03031), . . . , (a|S|, p\u0303|S|)}, where p\u0303i = pi + \u03c3\u03f5i and \u03f5i \u223c N (0, I3), (1) The noise scale \u03c3 is a tuneable hyperparameter (an interpretation of which is given in Section 3.2.1). We train the model as a denoising autoencoder by minimizing the following loss with respect to \u03b8: Ep(S\u0303,S) [\u2225\u2225\u2225GNN\u03b8(S\u0303)\u2212 (\u03f51, . . . , \u03f5|S|)\u2225\u2225\u22252] . (2) The distribution p(S\u0303, S) corresponds to sampling a structure S from Dstructures and adding noise to it according to Equation (1). Note that the model predicts the noise, not the original coordinates. Next, we motivate denoising as our pre-training objective for molecular modelling. 3.2.1 DENOISING AS LEARNING A FORCE FIELD: Datasets in quantum chemistry are typically generated by minimizing expensive-to-compute interatomic forces with methods such as density functional theory (DFT) (Parr & Weitao, 1994). We speculate that learning this force field would give rise to useful representations for downstream tasks, since molecular properties vary with forces and energy. Therefore, a reasonable pre-training objective would be one that involves learning the force field. Unfortunately, this force field is either unknown or expensive to evaluate, and hence it cannot be used directly for pre-training. An alternative is to approximate the data-generating force field with one that can be cheaply evaluated and use it to learn good representations \u2013 an approach we outline in this section. Using the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching (Vincent, 2011; Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020), we can show that the denoising objective in Equation (2) is equivalent to learning a particular force field directly from equilibrium structures with some desirable properties. For clarity, in this subsection we condition on and suppress the atom types and molecule size in our notation, specifying a molecular structure by its coordinates x \u2208 R3N (with N as the size of the molecule). From the perspective of statistical physics, a structure x can be treated as a random quantity sampled from the Boltzmann distribution pphysical(x) \u221d exp(\u2212E(x)), where E(x) is the (potential) energy of x. According to pphysical, low energy structures have a high probability of occurring. Moreover, the per-atom forces are given by \u2207x log pphysical(x) = \u2212\u2207xE(x), which is referred to as the force field. Our goal is to learn this force field. However both the energy function E and distribution pphysical are unknown, and we only have access to a set of equilibrium structures x1, . . . ,xn that locally minimize the energy E. Since x1, . . . ,xn are then local maxima of the distribution pphysical, our main approximation is to replace pphysical with a mixture of Gaussians centered at the data: pphysical(x\u0303) \u2248 q\u03c3(x\u0303) := 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi), where we define q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) = N (x\u0303;xi, \u03c32I3N ). This approximation captures the fact that pphysical will have local maxima at the equilibrium structures, vary smoothly with x and is computationally convenient. Learning the force field corresponding to q\u03c3(x\u0303) now yields a score-matching objective: Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u22252 ] . (3) As shown by Vincent (2011), and recently applied to generative modelling (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022), this objective is equivalent to the denoising objective. Specifically, defining q0(x) = 1n \u2211n i=1 \u03b4(x = xi) to be the empirical distribution and q\u03c3(x\u0303,x) = q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)q0(x), the objective in Equation (3) is equivalent to: Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u22252 ] = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212 x\u2212 x\u0303\u03c32 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 ] . (4) We notice that the RHS corresponds to the earlier denoising loss in Equation (2) (up to a constant factor of 1/\u03c3 applied to GNN\u03b8 that can be absorbed into the network). To summarize, denoising equilibrium structures corresponds to learning the force field that arises from approximating the distribution pphysical with a mixture of Gaussians. Note that we can interpret the noise scale \u03c3 as being related to the sharpness of pphysical or E around the local maxima xi. We also remark that the equivalence between Equation (3) and the LHS of Equation (4) does not require q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) to be a Gaussian distribution (Vincent, 2011), and other choices will lead to different denoising objectives, which we leave as future work. See Appendix B for technical caveats and details. 3.2.2 NOISY NODES: DENOISING AS AN AUXILIARY LOSS: Recently, Godwin et al. (2022) also applied denoising as an auxiliary loss to molecular property prediction, achieving significant improvements on a variety of molecular datasets. In particular, their approach, called Noisy Nodes, consisted of augmenting the usual optimization objective for predicting y with an auxiliary denoising loss. They suggested two explanations for why Noisy Nodes improves performance. First, the presence of a vertex-level loss discourages oversmoothing (Chen et al., 2019; Cai & Wang, 2020) of vertex/edge features after multiple message-passing layers \u2013 a common problem plaguing GNNs \u2013 because successful denoising requires diversity amongst vertex features in order to match the diversity in the noise targets \u03f5i. Second, they argued that denoising can aid representation learning by encouraging the network to learn aspects of the input distribution. The empirical success of Noisy Nodes indicates that denoising can indeed result in meaningful representations. Since Noisy Nodes incorporates denoising only as an auxiliary task, the representation learning benefits of denoising are limited to the downstream dataset on which it is used as an auxiliary task. Our approach is to apply denoising as a pre-training objective on another large (unlabelled) dataset of structures to learn higher-quality representations, which results in better performance. 3.3 GNS AND GNS-TAT: The main two models we consider in this work are Graph Net Simulator (GNS) (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), which is a type of GNN, and a better-performing variant we contribute called GNSTAT. GNS-TAT makes use of a recently published network transformation method called Tailored Activation Transforms (TAT) (Zhang et al., 2022), which has been shown to prevent certain degenerate behaviors at initialization in deep MLPs/convnets that are reminiscent of oversmoothing in GNNs (and are also associated with training difficulties). While GNS is not by default compatible with the assumptions of TAT, we propose a novel GNN initialization scheme called \u201cEdge-Delta\u201d that makes it compatible by initializing to zero the weights that carry \u201cmessages\u201d from vertices to edges. This marks the first application of TAT to any applied problem in the literature. See Appendix A for details. 4 EXPERIMENTS: The goal of our experimental evaluation in this section is to answer the following questions. First, does pre-training a neural network via denoising improve performance on the downstream task compared to training from a random initialization? Second, how does the benefit of pre-training depend on the relationship between the upstream and downstream datasets? Our evaluation involves four realistic and challenging molecular datasets, which vary in size, compound compositions (organic or inorganic) and labelling methodology (DFT- or CCSD(T)-generated), as described below. 4.1 DATASETS AND TRAINING SETUP: Datasets. First, the main dataset we use for pre-training is PCQM4Mv2 (Nakata & Shimazaki, 2017), which contains 3.4 million organic molecules, specified by their 3D structures at equilibrium calculated using DFT.2 The molecules in PCQM4Mv2 only contain one label, however the labels are not used as denoising only requires the structures. The large scale and diversity of PCQM4Mv2 makes it well-suited for pre-training via denoising. Second, as a dataset for fine-tuning, we use QM9 (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014), which contains around 130,000 small organic molecules and is widely used as a molecular property prediction benchmark (Klicpera et al., 2020a; Fuchs et al., 2020; Satorras et al., 2021; Finzi et al., 2020; Hutchinson et al., 2021; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021; Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022; Godwin et al., 2022). Each molecule is specified by its structure alongside 12 associated molecular property labels. Third, Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) (Chanussot* et al., 2021) is a recent large benchmark of interacting surfaces and adsorbates relevant to catalyst discovery. OC20 contains various tasks, such as predicting the relaxed state energy from an initial high-energy structure (IS2RE). We explore different combinations of upstream and downstream tasks as described in Section 4.3. Lastly, DES15K (Donchev et al., 2021) is a small dataset we use for fine-tuning, which contains around 15,000 dimer geometries (i.e. molecule pairs) with non-covalent molecular 2An earlier version of this dataset without any 3D structures, called PCQM4M, was used for supervised pre-training (Ying et al., 2021), but to our knowledge, this is the first time the 3D structures from v2 have been used and in a self-supervised manner. interactions. Each pair is labelled with its interaction energy computed using the gold-standard CCSD(T) method (Bartlett & Musia\u0142, 2007). CCSD(T) is usually both more expensive and accurate than DFT, which is used for all aforementioned datasets. See Appendix D for further details and a discussion about the choice of using DFT-generated structures for pre-training. Figure 2 (right) shows what percentage of elements appearing in each of QM9, OC20 and DES15K also appear in PCQM4Mv2. Whereas QM9 is fully covered by PCQM4Mv2, we observe that DES15K has less element overlap with PCQM4Mv2 and less than < 30% of elements in OC20 are contained in PCQM4Mv2. This is owing to the fact that surface molecules in OC20 are inorganic lattices, none of which appear in PCQM4Mv2. This suggests that we can expect least transfer from PCQM4Mv2 to OC20. We also compare PCQM4Mv2 and QM9 in terms of the molecular compositions, i.e. the number of atoms of each element, that appear in each. Due to presence of isomers, both datasets contain multiple molecules with the same composition. For each molecular composition in QM9, Figure 2 (left) shows its frequency in both QM9 and PCQM4Mv2. We observe that most molecular compositions in QM9 also appear in PCQM4Mv2. We also remark that since pre-training is self-supervised using only unlabelled structures, test set contamination is not possible \u2013 in fact, PCQM4Mv2 does not have most of the labels in QM9. Training setup. GNS/GNS-TAT were implemented in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) using Haiku and Jraph (Hennigan et al., 2020; Godwin* et al., 2020). All experiments were averaged over 3 seeds. Detailed hyperparameter and hardware settings can be found in Appendices E and F. 4.2 RESULTS ON QM9: We evaluate two variants of our model on QM9 in Table 1, GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes trained from a random initialization versus pre-trained parameters. Pre-training is done on PCQM4Mv2 via denoising. For best performance on QM9, we found that using atom type masking and prediction during pre-training additionally helped (Hu et al., 2020a). We fine-tune a separate model for each of the 12 targets, as usually done on QM9, using a single pre-trained model. This is repeated for three seeds (including pre-training). Following customary practice, hyperparameters, including the noise scale for denoising during pre-training and fine-tuning, are tuned on the HOMO target and then kept fixed for all other targets. We first observe that GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes performs competitively with other models and significantly improves upon GNS with Noisy Nodes, revealing the benefit of the TAT modifications. Utilizing pre-training then further improves performance across all targets, achieving a new state-of-the-art compared to prior work for 10 out of 12 targets. Interestingly, for the electronic spatial extent target \u2329 R2 \u232a , we found GNS-TAT to perform worse than other models, which may be due to the optimal noise scale being different from that of other targets. 4.3 RESULTS ON OC20: Next, we consider the Open Catalyst 2020 benchmark focusing on the downstream task of predicting the relaxed energy from the initial structure (IS2RE). We compared GNS with Noisy Nodes trained from scratch versus using pre-trained parameters. We experimented with two options for pre-training: (1) pre-training via denoising on PCQM4Mv2, and (2) pre-training via denoising on OC20 itself. For the latter, we follow Godwin et al.\u2019s [2022] approach of letting the denoising target be the relaxed structure, while the perturbed input is a random interpolation between the initial and relaxed structures with added Gaussian noise \u2013 this corresponds to the IS2RS task with additional noise. As shown in Figure 3 (left), pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 offers no benefit for validation performance on IS2RE, however pre-training on OC20 leads to considerably faster convergence but the same final performance. The lack of transfer from PCQM4Mv2 to OC20 is likely due to the difference in nature of the two datasets and the small element overlap as discussed in Section 4.1 and Figure 2 (right). On the other hand, faster convergence from using parameters pre-trained on OC20 suggests that denoising learned meaningful features. Unsurprisingly, the final performance is unchanged since the upstream and downstream datasets are the same in this case, so pre-training with denoising is identical to the auxiliary task of applying Noisy Nodes. The performance achieved is also competitive with other models in the literature as shown in Table 8. 4.4 RESULTS ON DES15K: In our experiments so far, all downstream tasks were based on DFT-generated datasets. While DFT calculations are more expensive than using neural networks, they are relatively cheap compared to even higher quality methods such as CCSD(T) (Bartlett & Musia\u0142, 2007). In this section, we evaluate how useful pre-training on DFT-generated structures from PCQM4Mv2 is when fine-tuning on the recent DES15K dataset which contains higher quality CCSD(T)-generated interaction energies. Moreover, unlike QM9, inputs from DES15K are systems of two interacting molecules and the dataset contains only around 15,000 examples, rendering it more challenging. We compare the test performance on DES15K achieved by GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes when trained from scratch versus using pre-trained parameters from PCQM4Mv2. As a baseline, we also include pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 using 2D-based AttrMask (Hu et al., 2020a) by masking and predicting atomic numbers. Figure 3 (right) shows that using Noisy Nodes significantly improves performance compared to training from scratch, with a further improvement resulting from using pre-training via denoising. AttrMask underperforms denoising since it likely does not fully exploit the 3D structural information. Importantly, this shows that pre-training by denoising structures obtained through relatively cheap methods such as DFT can even be beneficial when fine-tuning on more expensive and smaller downstream datasets. See Appendix G.1 for similar results on another architecture. 5 ANALYSIS:  5.1 PRE-TRAINING A DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURE: To explore whether pre-training is beneficial beyond GNS/GNS-TAT, we applied pre-training via denoising to the TorchMD-NET architecture (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022). TorchMD-NET is a transformer-based architecture whose layers maintain per-atom scalar features xi \u2208 RF and vector features vi \u2208 R3\u00d7F , where F is the feature dimension, that are updated in each layer using a selfattention mechanism. We implemented denoising by using gated equivariant blocks (Weiler et al., 2018; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021) applied to the processed scalar and vector features. The resulting vector features are then used as the noise prediction. In Table 2, we evaluate the effect of adding Noisy Nodes and pre-training to the architecture on the HOMO and LUMO targets in QM9. Pre-training yields a boost in performance, allowing the model to achieve SOTA results. Note that the results shown for TorchMD-NET are from our runs using Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis\u2019s [2022] open-source code, which led to slightly worse results than their published ones (our pre-training results still outperform their published results). Our code for experiments on TorchMD-NET is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced. 5.2 VARYING DATASET SIZES: We also investigate how downstream test performance on the HOMO target in QM9 varies as a function of the number of upstream and downstream training examples. First, we compare the performance of GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes either trained from scratch or using pre-trained parameters for different numbers of training examples from QM9; we also include the performance of just GNS-TAT. As shown in Figure 4 (left), pre-training improves the downstream performance for all dataset sizes. The difference in test MAE also grows as the downstream training data reduces. Second, we assess the effect of varying the amount of pre-training data while fixing the downstream dataset size for both GNS and GNS-TAT as shown in Figure 4 (middle). For both models, we find that downstream performance generally improves as upstream data increases, with saturating performance for GNS-TAT. More upstream data can yield better quality representations. 5.3 VARYING MODEL SIZE: We study the benefit of pre-training as models are scaled up on large downstream datasets. Recall that the S2EF dataset in OC20 contains around 130 million DFT evaluations for catalytic systems, providing three orders of magnitude more training data than QM9. We compare the performance of four GNS models with sizes ranging from 10 million to 1.2 billion parameters scaled up by increasing the hidden layer sizes in the MLPs. Each is pre-trained via denoising using the trajectories provided for the IS2RE/IS2RS tasks as described in Section 4.3. We also compare this to a 130 million parameter variant of GNS trained from scratch. As shown in Figure 4 (right), the pre-trained models continue to benefit from larger model sizes.We also observe that pre-training is beneficial, as the model trained from scratch underperforms in comparison: the 130 million parameters model trained from scratch is outperformed by a pre-trained model of less than half the size. 5.4 PRE-TRAINING IMPROVES FORCE PREDICTION: As shown in Section 3.2.1, denoising structures corresponds to learning an approximate force field directly from equilibrium structures. We explore whether pre-training via denoising would therefore also improve models trained to predict atomic forces. We compare the performance of TorchMD-NET for force prediction on the MD17 (aspirin) dataset with and without pre-training on PCQM4Mv2. Table 3 shows that pre-training improves force prediction. We also assess the effect of pre-training on the OC20 dataset for force prediction in Appendix G.3, similarly finding an improvement due to pre-training. 5.5 FREEZING PRE-TRAINED PARAMETERS Finally, we perform an experiment to assess how useful the features learned by pre-training are if they are not fine-tuned for the downstream task but kept fixed instead. Specifically, on the HOMO target in QM9, we freeze the backbone of the model and fine-tune only the decoder (cf. Appendix A). To evaluate this, we compare it to using random parameters from initialization for the model\u2019s backbone, which allows us to isolate how useful the pre-trained features are. As described in Appendix A, the decoder is a simple module involving no message-passing. Figure 5 shows that only training the decoder while keeping the pre-trained parameters fixed results in test MAE of 40 meV, which is worse than fine-tuning the entire model but substantially better than the performance of >100 meV in test MAE resulting from training the decoder when the remaining parameters are randomly initialized. This suggests that the features learned by denoising are more discriminative for downstream prediction than random features. We note that training only the decoder is also substantially faster than training the entire network \u2013 one batch on a single V100 GPU takes 15ms, which is 50\u00d7 faster than one batch using 16 TPUs for the full network. 6 LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK: We have shown that pre-training can significantly improve performance for various tasks. One additional advantage of pre-trained models is that they can be shared in the community, allowing practitioners to fine-tune models on their datasets. However, unlike vision and NLP, molecular networks vary widely and the community has not yet settled on a \u201cstandard\u201d architecture, making pre-trained weights less reusable. Moreover, the success of pre-training inevitably depends on the relationship between the upstream and downstream datasets. In the context of molecular property prediction, understanding what aspects of the upstream data distribution must match the downstream data distribution for transfer is an important direction for future work. More generally, pre-training models on large datasets incurs a computational cost. However, our results show that pre-training for 3D molecular prediction does not require the same scale as large NLP and vision models. We discuss considerations on the use of compute and broader impact in Appendix C. 7 CONCLUSION: We investigated pre-training neural networks by denoising in the space of 3D molecular structures. We showed that denoising in this context is equivalent to learning a force field, motivating its ability to learn useful representations and shedding light on successful applications of denoising in other works (Godwin et al., 2022). This technique enabled us to utilize existing large datasets of 3D structures for improving performance on various downstream molecular property prediction tasks, setting a new SOTA in some cases such as QM9. More broadly, this bridges the gap between the utility of pre-training in vision/NLP and molecular property prediction from structures. We hope that this approach will be particularly impactful for applications of deep learning to scientific problems. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT Our theoretical results, complete with assumptions and proofs, are included in Section 3.2.1 and Appendix B. The code to reproduce our experiments on the TorchMD-NET architecture is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication. We report hardware setup with training times in Appendix E and detailed hyperparameter settings in Appendix F. Datasets are described with their respective licenses in Appendix D. A ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS: A.1 STANDARD GNS As our base model architecture we chose a Graph Net Simulator (GNS) (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), which consists of an ENCODER which constructs a graph representation from the input S, a PROCESSOR of repeated message passing blocks that update the latent graph representation, and a DECODER which produces predictions. Our implementation follows Godwin et al.\u2019s [2022] modifications to enable molecular and graph-level property predictions which has been shown to achieve strong results across different molecular prediction tasks without relying on problem-specific features. In the ENCODER, we represent the set of atoms S = {(a1,p1), (a2,p2), . . . , (a|S|,p|S|)} as a directed graph G = (V,E) where V = {v1,v2, . . . ,v|S|} and E = {ei,j}i,j are the sets of \u201cfeaturized\u201d vertices and edges, respectively. Edges ei,j \u2208 E are constructed whenever the distance between the i-th and j-th atoms is less than the connectivity radius Rcut, in which case we connect vi and vj with a directed edge ei,j from i to j that is a featurization of the displacement vector pj \u2212 pi. Meanwhile, for the i-th atom, vi is given by a learnable vector embedding of the atomic number ai. The PROCESSOR consists of L message-passing steps that produce intermediate graphs G1, . . . , GL (with the same connectivity structure as the initial one). Each of these steps computes the sum of a shortcut connection from the previous graph, and the application of an Interaction Network (Battaglia et al., 2016). Interaction Networks first update each edge feature by applying an \u201cedge update function\u201d to a combination of the existing feature and the features of the two connected vertices. They then update each vertex feature by applying a \u201cvertex update function\u201d to a combination of the existing feature and the (new) edge features of incoming edges. In GNS, edge update functions are 3 hidden layer fully-connected MLPs, using a \u201cshifted softplus\u201d (ssp(x) = log(0.5ex + 0.5)) activation function, applied to the concatenation of the relevant edge and vertex features, followed by a layer normalization layer. Vertex update functions are similar, but are applied to the concatenation of the relevant vertex feature and sum over relevant edge features. In our implementation of GNS we applied the same PROCESSOR in sequence three times (with shared parameters), with the output of each being decoded to produce a prediction and corresponding loss value. The loss for the whole model is then given by the average of these. (Test-time predictions are meanwhile computed using only the output of the final PROCESSOR.) The DECODER is responsible for computing graph-level and vertex-level predictions from the output of each PROCESSOR. Vertex-level predictions, such as noise as described in Section 3.2, are decoded using an MLP applied to each vertex feature. Graph-level predictions (e.g. energies) are produced by applying an MLP to each vertex feature, aggregating the result over vertices (via a sum), and then applying another MLP to the result. Private & Confidential A.2 GNS WITH TAILORED ACTIVATION TRANSFORMATION (GNS-TAT) Tailored Activation Transformation (TAT) (Zhang et al., 2022) is a method for initializing and transforming neural networks to make them easier to train, and is based on a similar method called Deep Kernel Shaping (DKS) (Martens et al., 2021). TAT controls the propagation of \u201cq values\u201d, which are initialization-time approximations to dimension-normalized squared norms of the network\u2019s layer-wise activation vectors, and \u201cc values\u201d, which are cosine similarities between such vectors (for different inputs). In other words, q values approximate \u2225z(x)\u22252/ dim(z(x)), where z(x) denotes a layer\u2019s output as a function of the network\u2019s input x, and c values approximate z(x)\u22a4z(x\u2032)/(\u2225z(x)\u2225\u2225z(x\u2032)\u2225), where x\u2032 is another possible network input. In standard deep networks, c values will converge to a constant value c\u221e \u2208 [0, 1], so that \u201cgeometric information\u201d is lost, which leads to training difficulties (Martens et al., 2021). DKS/TAT prevents this convergence through a combination of careful weight initialization, and transformations to the network\u2019s activation functions and sum/average layers. Oversmoothing (Chen et al., 2019; Cai & Wang, 2020; Rong et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zhao & Akoglu, 2020; Do et al., 2021) is a phenomenon observed in GNN architectures where vertex/edge features all converge to approximately the same value with depth, and is associated with training difficulties. It is reminiscent of how, when c\u221e = 1, feature vectors will converge with depth to a constant input-independent vector in standard deep networks. It therefore seems plausible that applying TAT to GNNs may help with the oversmoothing problem and thus improve training performance. Unfortunately, the GNS architecture violates two key assumptions of TAT. Firstly, the sums over edge features (performed in the vertex update functions) violate the assumption that all sum operations must be between the outputs of linear layers with independently sampled initial weights. Secondly, GNS networks have multiple inputs for which information needs to be independently preserved and propagated to the output, while DKS/TAT assumes a single input (or multiple inputs whose representations evolve independently in the network). To address these issues we introduce a new initialization scheme called \u201cEdge-Delta\u201d, which initializes to zero the weights that multiply incoming vertex features in the edge update functions (and treats these weights as absent for the purpose of computing the initial weight variance). This approach is inspired by the use of the \u201cDelta initialization\" (Balduzzi et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2018) for convolutional networks in DKS/TAT, which initializes filter weights of the non-central locations to zero, thus allowing geometric information, in the form of c values, to propagate independently for each location in the feature map. When using the Edge-Delta initialization, edge features propagate independently of each other (and of vertex features), through what is essentially a standard deep residual network (with edge update functions acting as the residual branches), which we will refer to as the \u201cedge network\u201d. Given the use of Edge-Delta we can then apply TAT to GNS as follows3. First, we replace GNS\u2019s activation functions with TAT\u2019s transformed Leaky-ReLU activation functions (or \u201cTailored ReLUs\u201d), which we compute with TAT\u2019s \u03b7 parameter set to 0.8, and its \u201csubnetwork maximizing function\u201d defined on the edge network4. We also replace each sum involving shortcut connections with weighted sums, whose weights are 0.9 and \u221a 1\u2212 0.92 for the shortcut and non-shortcut branches respectively. We retain the use of layer normalization layers in the edge/vertex update functions, but move them to before the first fully-connected layer, as this seems to give the best performance. As required by TAT, we use a standard Gaussian fan-in initialization for the weights, and a zero initialization for the biases, with Edge-Delta used only for the first linear layer of the edge update functions. Finally, we replace the sum used to aggregate vertex features in the DECODER with an average. See Figures 6 and 7 for an illustration of these changes. We experimented with an analogous \u201cVertex-Delta\u201d initialization, which initializes to zero weights in the vertex update functions that multiply summed edge features, but found that Edge-Delta gave the best results. This might be because the edge features, which encode distances between vertices (and are best preserved with the Edge-Delta approach), are generally much more informative than the vertex features in molecular property prediction tasks. We also ran informal ablation studies, and found that each of our changes to the original GNS model contributed to improved results, with the use of Edge-Delta and weighted shortcut sums being especially important. B DENOISING AS LEARNING A FORCE FIELD: We specify a molecular structure as x = (x(1), . . . ,x(N)) \u2208 R3N , where x(i) \u2208 R3 is the coordinate of atom i. Let E(x) denote the total (potential) energy of x, such that \u2212\u2207xE(x) are the forces on the atoms. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, learning the force field, i.e. the mapping x 7\u2192 \u2212\u2207xE(x), 3Note that Edge-Delta initialization is compatible with TAT, since for the purposes of q/c value propagation, zero-initialized connections in the network can be treated as absent. 4For the purposes of computing the subnetwork maximizing function we ignore the rest of the network and just consider the edge network. While the layer normalization layer (which we move before the MLP) technically depends on the vertex features, this dependency can be ignored as long as the q values of these features is 1 (which will be true given the complete set of changes we make to the GNS architecture). is a reasonable pre-training objective. Furthermore, learning the force field can be viewed as scorematching if we define the distribution pphysical(x) \u221d exp(\u2212E(x)) and observe that the score of pphysical is the force field: \u2207x log pphysical(x) = \u2212\u2207xE(x). However, a technical caveat is that pphysical is an improper probability density, because it cannot be normalized due to the translation invariance of E. Writing the translation of a structure as x + t := (x(1) + t, . . . ,x(N) + t) where t \u2208 R3 is a constant vector, we have E(x + t) = E(x). This implies that the normalizing constant \u222b R3N pphysical(x) dx diverges to infinity. To remedy this, we can restrict ourselves to the (3N\u22123)-dimensional subspace V := {x \u2208 R3N | \u2211 i x (i) = 0} \u2286 R3N consisting of the mean-centered structures, over which pphysical can be defined as a normalizable distribution. Proceeding similarly as Section 3.2.1, let x1, . . . ,xn \u2208 V be a set of mean-centered equilibrium structures. For any x\u0303 \u2208 V , we now approximate pphysical(x\u0303) \u2248 q\u03c3(x\u0303) := 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi), where the Gaussian distributions q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) are defined on V as: q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c3)(3N\u22123)/2 exp ( \u2212 1 2\u03c32 \u2225x\u0303\u2212 xi\u22252 ) . For convenience, we have expressed structures as vectors in the ambient space R3N , however they are restricted to lie in the smaller space V . Note that the normalizing constant accounts for the fact that V is (3N \u2212 3)-dimensional. As before, we define q0(x) = 1n \u2211n i=1 \u03b4(x = xi) to be the empirical distribution and q\u03c3(x\u0303,x) = q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)q0(x). The score-matching objective is given by: J1(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u22252 ] , (5) where the expectation is now over V . As shown by Vincent (2011), minimizing the objective above is equivalent to the minimizing the following objective: J2(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u22252 ] . (6) This is recognized as a denoising objective, because \u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x) = (x \u2212 x\u0303)/\u03c32. A practical implication of this analysis is that the noise (x \u2212 x\u0303)/\u03c32 \u2208 V should be mean-centered, which is intuitive since it is impossible to predict a translational component in the noise. We include a proof of the equivalence between Equations (5) and (6) for completeness: Proposition 1 (Vincent (2011)). The minimization objectives J1(\u03b8) and J2(\u03b8) are equivalent. Proof. We first observe: J1(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u22252 ] \u2212 2Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u27e9] + C1 J2(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u22252 ] \u2212 2Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u27e9] + C2, where C1, C2 are constants independent of \u03b8. Therefore, it suffices to show that the middle terms on the RHS are equal. Since expectations over q\u03c3(x\u0303) and q\u03c3(x\u0303,x) are restricted to V \u2286 R3N , we apply a change of basis to write them as integrals against the (3N\u22123)-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Pick an orthonormal basis {v1, . . . ,v3N\u22123} \u2286 R3N for V and let PV = [v1, . . . ,v3N\u22123] \u2208 R3N\u00d73(N\u22121) be the projection matrix, so z = P \u22baV x expresses a mean-centered structure x in terms of the coordinates of the chosen basis for V . Noting that PV has orthonormal columns and that it yields a bijection between V and R3N\u22123, we calculate: Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u27e9] = \u222b R3N\u22123 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303)\u27e8GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303),\u2207 log q\u03c3(PV z\u0303)\u27e9dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303) \u2329 GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303), \u2207q\u03c3(PV z\u0303) q\u03c3(PV z\u0303) \u232a dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 \u27e8GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303),\u2207q\u03c3(PV z\u0303)\u27e9dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 \u2329 GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303), 1 n n\u2211 i=1 \u2207q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi) \u232a dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 \u2329 GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303), 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi)\u2207 log q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi) \u232a dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi) \u27e8GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303),\u2207 log q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi)\u27e9dz\u0303 = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u27e9] C BROADER IMPACT: Who may benefit from this work? Molecular property prediction works towards a range of applications in materials design, chemistry, and drug discovery. Wider use of pre-trained models may accelerate progress in a similar manner to how pre-trained language or image models have enabled practitioners to avoid training on large datasets from scratch. Pre-training via denoising is simple to implement and can be immediately adopted to improve performance on a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks. As research converges on more standardized architectures, we expect shared pre-trained weights will become more common across the community. Potential negative impact and ethical considerations. Pre-training models on large structure datasets incurs additional computational cost when compared to training a potentially smaller model with less capacity from scratch. Environmental mitigation should be taken into account when pretraining large models (Patterson et al., 2021). However, the computational cost of pre-training can and should be offset by sharing pre-trained embeddings when possible. Moreover, in our ablations of upstream dataset sizes for GNS-TAT, we observed that training on a subset of PCQM4Mv2 was sufficient for strong downstream performance. In future work, we plan to investigate how smaller subsets with sufficient diversity can be used to minimize computational requirements, e.g. by requiring fewer gradient steps. D DATASETS: PCQM4Mv2. The main dataset we use for pre-training is PCQM4Mv2 (Nakata & Shimazaki, 2017) (license: CC BY 4.0), which contains 3,378,606 organic molecules, specified by their 3D structures at equilibrium (atom types and coordinates) calculated using DFT. Molecules in PCQM4Mv2 have around 30 atoms on average and vary in terms of their composition, with the dataset containing 22 unique elements in total. The molecules in PCQM4Mv2 only contain one label, unlike e.g. QM9, which contains 12 labels per molecule, however we do not use these labels as denoising only requires the structures. QM9. QM9 is a dataset (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014) (license: CCBY 4.0) with approximately 130,000 small organic molecules containing up to nine heavy C, N, O, F atoms, specified by their structures. Each molecule has 12 different labels corresponding to different molecular properties, such as highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and internal energy, which we use for fine-tuning. OC20. Open Catalyst 2020 (Chanussot* et al., 2021) (OC20, license: CC Attribution 4.0) is a recent large benchmark containing trajectories of interacting surfaces and adsorbates that are relevant to catalyst discovery and optimization. This dataset contains three tasks: predicting the relaxed state energy from the initial structure (IS2RE), predicting the relaxed structure from the initial structure (IS2RS) and predicting the energy and forces given the structure at any point in the trajectory (S2EF). For IS2RE and IS2RS, there are 460,000 training examples, where each data point is a trajectory of a surface-adsorbate molecule pair starting with a high-energy initial structure that is relaxed towards a low-energy, equilibrium structure. For S2EF, there are 113 million examples of (non-equilibrium) structures with their associated energies and per-atom forces. DES15K. DES15K (Donchev et al., 2021) (license: CC0 1.0) is a small dataset containing around 15,000 interacting molecule pairs, specifically dimer geometries with non-covalent molecular interactions. Each pair is labelled with the associated interaction energy computed using the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) (Bartlett & Musia\u0142, 2007), which is widely regarded as the gold-standard method in electronic structure theory. Usage of DFT-generated structures for pre-training. The structures in PCQM4Mv2 are obtained using DFT calculations, which in principle could have also been used to generate labels for molecular properties in DFT-generated downstream datasets, such as QM9. However, there are multiple reasons why denoising remains a desirable pre-training objective in such settings. First, although there is a computational cost for generating datasets such as PCQM4Mv2, it is now openly available and part of our aim is to understand how to leverage such datasets for tasks on other datasets (analogous to how ImageNet is expensive to build, but once it is available, it is important to understand how it can improve downstream performance on other datasets). Second, even if PCQM4Mv2 contained all the labels in QM9, pre-training via denoising structures allows one to pre-train a single, label-agnostic model which can be individually fine-tuned on any of the targets in QM9. This is substantially cheaper than per-target pre-training, and the resulting pre-trained model is also re-useable for differing needs and downstream tasks. In other settings where the downstream dataset is generated using more expensive methods than DFT, pre-training via denoising DFT-relaxed structures can also be helpful and has a clear benefit, as shown by our experiment on the CCSD(T)-generated dataset DES15K where denoising on PCQM4Mv2 improves performance for a downstream task involving a \u201chigher\u201d level of theory such as CCSD(T). Generally, we emphasize that the methodology of denoising structures can be applied to any dataset of structures (regardless of whether they are computed using DFT or not). We hope that denoising will be useful in the future for learning representations by pre-training on structures obtained through other methods such as experimental data (in which case labeling may be expensive) and databases generated by other models such as AlphaFold (where only structures are available) (Jumper et al., 2021). E EXPERIMENT SETUP AND COMPUTE RESOURCES: Below, we list details on our experiment setup and hardware resources used. GNS & GNS-TAT. GNS-TAT training for QM9, PCQM4Mv2 and DES15K was done on a cluster of 16 TPU v3 devices and evaluation on a single V100 device. GNS training for OC20 was done on 8 TPU v4 devices, with the exception of the 1.2 billion parameters variant of the model, which was trained on 64 TPU v4 devices. Pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 was executed for 3 \u00b7 105 gradient updates (approximately 1.5 days of training). Fine-tuning experiments were run until convergence for QM9 (106 gradient updates taking approximately 2 days) and DES15K (105 gradient updates taking approximately 4 hours) and stopped after 5 \u00b7 105 gradient updates on OC20 (2.5 days) to minimize hardware use (the larger models keep benefiting from additional gradient updates). TorchMD-NET. We implemented denoising for TorchMD-NET on top of Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis\u2019s [2022] open-source code.5 Models were trained on QM9 using data parallelism over two NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPUs. Pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 was done using three GPUs to accommodate the larger molecules while keeping the batch size approximately the same as QM9. All hyperparameters except the learning rate schedule were kept fixed at the defaults. Pre-training took roughly 24 hours, whereas fine-tuning took around 16 hours. 5Available on GitHub at: https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net. Hyperparameter optimization. We note that effective pre-training via denoising requires sweeping noise values, as well as loss co-efficients for denoising and atom type recovery. For GNS/GNS-TAT, we relied on the hyperparameters published by Godwin et al. (2022) but determined new noise values for pre-training and fine-tuning by tuning over a grid of approximately 5 values each on PCQM4Mv2 and QM9 (for the HOMO target). We used the same values for DES15K without modification. We also ran a similar number of experiments to determine cosine cycle parameters for learning rates. F HYPERPARAMETERS: We report the main hyperparameters used for GNS and GNS-TAT below. G ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: G.1 PERFORMANCE OF TORCHMD-NET ON DES15K In addition to the experiments involving GNS-TAT on DES15K in Section 4.4, we also consider the performance of TorchMD-NET on DES15K with and without pre-training on PCQM4Mv2. As shown in Table 7, TorchMD-NET outperforms GNS-TAT when trained from scratch, and pre-training then yields a further boost in performance as with GNS-TAT. G.2 COMPARISON OF OC20 IS2RE PRE-TRAINING PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER ARCHITECTURES Table 8 compares the performance of our models with various other architectures proposed in prior work. GNS yields SOTA performance on each of the four validation sets for the direct IS2RE task. As discussed in Section 4.3 and shown in Figure 3 (left), the model pre-trained on OC20 itself achieves SOTA performance with faster convergence than all other GNS variants. Note that since we pre-train on OC20 itself, the pre-trained model performs equally well at convergence as the model trained from scratch with noisy nodes (cf. Section 4.3). G.3 PRE-TRAINING VIA DENOISING FOR FORCE PREDICTION ON OC20 Recall that in Section 5.4 we explored whether pre-training also improves force prediction models, given the link between denoising and learning forces as described in Section 3.2.1. In this section, we consider a second experiment for force models. The OC20 dataset contains a force prediction task (S2EF), where a model is trained to predict point-wise energy and forces (each point being a single DFT evaluation during a relaxation trajectory) from a given 3D structure. Tables 9 and 10 show the performance of GNS when trained from scratch vs. pre-trained via denoising on equilibrium structures in OC20, as described in Section 4.3. We show two metrics for measuring force prediction performance on each of the four validation datasets: mean absolute error (lower is better) and cosine similarity (higher is better).

In this paper, we describe a pre-training technique based on denoising that achieves a new state-of-the-art in molecular property prediction by utilizing large datasets of 3D molecular structures at equilibrium to learn meaningful representations for downstream tasks. Relying on the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching, we show that the denoising objective corresponds to learning a molecular force field \u2013 arising from approximating the Boltzmann distribution with a mixture of Gaussians \u2013 directly from equilibrium structures. Our experiments demonstrate that using this pre-training objective significantly improves performance on multiple benchmarks, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the majority of targets in the widely used QM9 dataset. Our analysis then provides practical insights into the effects of different factors \u2013 dataset sizes, model size and architecture, and the choice of upstream and downstream datasets \u2013 on pre-training. 1 INTRODUCTION: The success of the best performing neural networks in vision and natural language processing (NLP) relies on pre-training the models on large datasets to learn meaningful features for downstream tasks (Dai & Le, 2015; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). For molecular property prediction from 3D structures (a point cloud of atomic nuclei in R3), the problem of how to similarly learn such representations remains open. For example, none of the best models on the widely used QM9 benchmark use any form of pre-training (e.g. Klicpera et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2022b; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021; Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022), in stark contrast with vision and NLP. Effective methods for pre-training could have a significant impact on fields such as drug discovery and material science. In this work, we focus on the problem of how large datasets of 3D molecular structures can be utilized to improve performance on downstream molecular property prediction tasks that also rely on 3D structures as input. We address the question: how can one exploit large datasets like PCQM4Mv2,1 that contain over 3 million structures, to improve performance on datasets such as DES15K that are orders of magnitude smaller? Our answer is a form of self-supervised pre-training that generates useful representations for downstream prediction tasks, leading to state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Inspired by recent advances in noise regularization for graph neural networks (GNNs) (Godwin et al., 2022), our pre-training objective is based on denoising in the space of structures (and is hence self-supervised). Unlike existing pre-training methods, which largely focus on 2D graphs, our approach targets the setting where the downstream task involves 3D point clouds defining the molecular structure. Relying on the well-known connection between denoising and score-matching (Vincent, 2011; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020), we show that the denoising objective is equivalent to learning a particular force field, adding a new interpretation of denoising in the context of molecules and shedding light on how it aids representation learning. The contributions of our work are summarized as follows: 1Note that PCQM4Mv2 is a new version of PCQM4M that now offers 3D structures. Private & Confidential \u2022 We investigate a simple and effective method for pre-training via denoising in the space of 3D structures with the aim of improving downstream molecular property prediction from such 3D structures. Our denoising objective is shown to be related to learning a specific force field. \u2022 Our experiments demonstrate that pre-training via denoising significantly improves performance on multiple challenging datasets that vary in size, nature of task, and molecular composition. This establishes that denoising over structures successfully transfers to molecular property prediction, setting, in particular, a new state-of-the-art on 10 out of 12 targets in the widely used QM9 dataset. Figure 1 illustrates performance on one of the targets in QM9. \u2022 We make improvements to a common GNN, in particular showing how to apply Tailored Activation Transformation (TAT) (Zhang et al., 2022) to Graph Network Simulators (GNS) (SanchezGonzalez et al., 2020), which is complementary to pre-training and further boosts performance. \u2022 We analyze the benefits of pre-training by gaining insights into the effects of dataset size, model size and architecture, and the relationship between the upstream and downstream datasets. 2 RELATED WORK: Pre-training of GNNs. Various recent works have formulated methods for pre-training using graph data (Liu et al., 2021b; Hu et al., 2020a; Xie et al., 2021; Kipf & Welling, 2016), rather than 3D point clouds of atom nuclei as in this paper. Approaches based on contrastive methods rely on learning representations by contrasting different views of the input graph (Sun et al., 2019; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2019; You et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a), or bootstrapping (Thakoor et al., 2021). Autoregressive or reconstruction-based approaches, such as ours, learn representations by requiring the model to predict aspects of the input graph (Hu et al., 2020a;b; Rong et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019). Most methods in the current literature are not designed to handle 3D structural information, focusing instead on 2D graphs. The closest work to ours is GraphMVP (Liu et al., 2021a), where 3D structure is treated as one view of a 2D molecule for the purpose of upstream contrastive learning. Their work focuses on downstream tasks that only involve 2D information, while our aim is to improve downstream models for molecular property prediction from 3D structures. After the release of this pre-print, similar ideas have been studied by Jiao et al. (2022) and Liu et al. (2022a). Denoising, representation learning and score-matching. Noise has long been known to improve generalization in machine learning (Sietsma & Dow, 1991; Bishop, 1995). Denoising autoencoders have been used to effectively learn representations by mapping corrupted inputs to original inputs (Vincent et al., 2008; 2010). Specific to GNNs (Battaglia et al., 2018; Scarselli et al., 2009; Bronstein et al., 2017), randomizing input graph features has been shown to improve performance (Hu et al., 2020a; Sato et al., 2021). Applications to physical simulation also involve corrupting the state with Gaussian noise (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2018; 2020; Pfaff et al., 2020). Our work builds on Noisy Nodes (Godwin et al., 2022), which incorporates denoising as an auxiliary task to improve performance, indicating the effectiveness of denoising for molecular property prediction (cf. Section 3.2.2). Denoising is also closely connected to score-matching (Vincent, 2011), which has become popular for generative modelling (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Hoogeboom et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2021). We also rely on this connection to show that denoising structures corresponds to learning a force field. Equivariant neural networks for 3D molecular property prediction. Recently, the dominant approach for improving models for molecular property prediction from 3D structures has been through the design of architectures that incorporate roto-translational inductive biases into the model, such that the outputs are invariant to translating and rotating the input atomic positions. A simple way to achieve this is to use roto-translation invariant features as inputs, such as inter-atomic distances (Sch\u00fctt et al., 2017; Unke & Meuwly, 2019), angles (Klicpera et al., 2020b;a; Shuaibi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b), or the principal axes of inertia (Godwin et al., 2022). There is also broad literature on equivariant neural networks, whose intermediate activations transform accordingly with roto-translations of inputs thereby naturally preserving inter-atomic distance and orientation information. Such models can be broadly categorized into those that are specifically designed for molecular property prediction (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021; Batzner et al., 2021; Anderson et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2020) and general-purpose architectures (Satorras et al., 2021; Finzi et al., 2020; Hutchinson et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2018; Kondor et al., 2018; Brandstetter et al., 2021). Our pre-training technique is architecture-agnostic, and we show that it can be applied to enhance performance in both a GNN-based architecture (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020) and a Transformer-based one (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022). We conjecture that similar improvements will hold for other models. 3 METHODOLOGY:  3.1 PROBLEM SETUP: Molecular property prediction consists of predicting scalar quantities given the structure of one or more molecules as input. Each data example is a labelled set specified as follows: we are provided with a set of atoms S = {(a1,p1), . . . , (a|S|,p|S|)}, where ai \u2208 {1, . . . , 118} and pi \u2208 R3 are the atomic number and 3D position respectively of atom i in the molecule, alongside a label y \u2208 R. We assume that the model, which takes S as input, is any architecture consisting of a backbone, which first processes S to build a latent representation of it, followed by a vertex-level or graph-level \u201cdecoder\u201d, that returns per-vertex predictions or a single prediction for the input respectively. 3.2 PRE-TRAINING VIA DENOISING: Given a dataset of molecular structures, we pre-train the network by denoising the structures, which operates as follows. Let Dstructures = {S1, . . . , Sn} denote the upstream dataset of equilibrium structures, and let GNN\u03b8 denote a graph neural network with parameters \u03b8 which takes S \u2208 Dstructures as input and returns per-vertex predictions GNN\u03b8(S) = (\u03f5\u03021, . . . , \u03f5\u0302|S|). The precise parameterization of the models we consider in this work is described in Section 3.3 and Appendix A. Starting with an input molecule S \u2208 Dstructures, we perturb it by adding i.i.d. Gaussian noise to its atomic positions pi. That is, we create a noisy version of the molecule: S\u0303 = {(a1, p\u03031), . . . , (a|S|, p\u0303|S|)}, where p\u0303i = pi + \u03c3\u03f5i and \u03f5i \u223c N (0, I3), (1) The noise scale \u03c3 is a tuneable hyperparameter (an interpretation of which is given in Section 3.2.1). We train the model as a denoising autoencoder by minimizing the following loss with respect to \u03b8: Ep(S\u0303,S) [\u2225\u2225\u2225GNN\u03b8(S\u0303)\u2212 (\u03f51, . . . , \u03f5|S|)\u2225\u2225\u22252] . (2) The distribution p(S\u0303, S) corresponds to sampling a structure S from Dstructures and adding noise to it according to Equation (1). Note that the model predicts the noise, not the original coordinates. Next, we motivate denoising as our pre-training objective for molecular modelling. 3.2.1 DENOISING AS LEARNING A FORCE FIELD: Datasets in quantum chemistry are typically generated by minimizing expensive-to-compute interatomic forces with methods such as density functional theory (DFT) (Parr & Weitao, 1994). We speculate that learning this force field would give rise to useful representations for downstream tasks, since molecular properties vary with forces and energy. Therefore, a reasonable pre-training objective would be one that involves learning the force field. Unfortunately, this force field is either unknown or expensive to evaluate, and hence it cannot be used directly for pre-training. An alternative is to approximate the data-generating force field with one that can be cheaply evaluated and use it to learn good representations \u2013 an approach we outline in this section. Using the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching (Vincent, 2011; Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020), we can show that the denoising objective in Equation (2) is equivalent to learning a particular force field directly from equilibrium structures with some desirable properties. For clarity, in this subsection we condition on and suppress the atom types and molecule size in our notation, specifying a molecular structure by its coordinates x \u2208 R3N (with N as the size of the molecule). From the perspective of statistical physics, a structure x can be treated as a random quantity sampled from the Boltzmann distribution pphysical(x) \u221d exp(\u2212E(x)), where E(x) is the (potential) energy of x. According to pphysical, low energy structures have a high probability of occurring. Moreover, the per-atom forces are given by \u2207x log pphysical(x) = \u2212\u2207xE(x), which is referred to as the force field. Our goal is to learn this force field. However both the energy function E and distribution pphysical are unknown, and we only have access to a set of equilibrium structures x1, . . . ,xn that locally minimize the energy E. Since x1, . . . ,xn are then local maxima of the distribution pphysical, our main approximation is to replace pphysical with a mixture of Gaussians centered at the data: pphysical(x\u0303) \u2248 q\u03c3(x\u0303) := 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi), where we define q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) = N (x\u0303;xi, \u03c32I3N ). This approximation captures the fact that pphysical will have local maxima at the equilibrium structures, vary smoothly with x and is computationally convenient. Learning the force field corresponding to q\u03c3(x\u0303) now yields a score-matching objective: Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u22252 ] . (3) As shown by Vincent (2011), and recently applied to generative modelling (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020; Ho et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022), this objective is equivalent to the denoising objective. Specifically, defining q0(x) = 1n \u2211n i=1 \u03b4(x = xi) to be the empirical distribution and q\u03c3(x\u0303,x) = q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)q0(x), the objective in Equation (3) is equivalent to: Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u22252 ] = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212 x\u2212 x\u0303\u03c32 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 ] . (4) We notice that the RHS corresponds to the earlier denoising loss in Equation (2) (up to a constant factor of 1/\u03c3 applied to GNN\u03b8 that can be absorbed into the network). To summarize, denoising equilibrium structures corresponds to learning the force field that arises from approximating the distribution pphysical with a mixture of Gaussians. Note that we can interpret the noise scale \u03c3 as being related to the sharpness of pphysical or E around the local maxima xi. We also remark that the equivalence between Equation (3) and the LHS of Equation (4) does not require q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) to be a Gaussian distribution (Vincent, 2011), and other choices will lead to different denoising objectives, which we leave as future work. See Appendix B for technical caveats and details. 3.2.2 NOISY NODES: DENOISING AS AN AUXILIARY LOSS: Recently, Godwin et al. (2022) also applied denoising as an auxiliary loss to molecular property prediction, achieving significant improvements on a variety of molecular datasets. In particular, their approach, called Noisy Nodes, consisted of augmenting the usual optimization objective for predicting y with an auxiliary denoising loss. They suggested two explanations for why Noisy Nodes improves performance. First, the presence of a vertex-level loss discourages oversmoothing (Chen et al., 2019; Cai & Wang, 2020) of vertex/edge features after multiple message-passing layers \u2013 a common problem plaguing GNNs \u2013 because successful denoising requires diversity amongst vertex features in order to match the diversity in the noise targets \u03f5i. Second, they argued that denoising can aid representation learning by encouraging the network to learn aspects of the input distribution. The empirical success of Noisy Nodes indicates that denoising can indeed result in meaningful representations. Since Noisy Nodes incorporates denoising only as an auxiliary task, the representation learning benefits of denoising are limited to the downstream dataset on which it is used as an auxiliary task. Our approach is to apply denoising as a pre-training objective on another large (unlabelled) dataset of structures to learn higher-quality representations, which results in better performance. 3.3 GNS AND GNS-TAT: The main two models we consider in this work are Graph Net Simulator (GNS) (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), which is a type of GNN, and a better-performing variant we contribute called GNSTAT. GNS-TAT makes use of a recently published network transformation method called Tailored Activation Transforms (TAT) (Zhang et al., 2022), which has been shown to prevent certain degenerate behaviors at initialization in deep MLPs/convnets that are reminiscent of oversmoothing in GNNs (and are also associated with training difficulties). While GNS is not by default compatible with the assumptions of TAT, we propose a novel GNN initialization scheme called \u201cEdge-Delta\u201d that makes it compatible by initializing to zero the weights that carry \u201cmessages\u201d from vertices to edges. This marks the first application of TAT to any applied problem in the literature. See Appendix A for details. 4 EXPERIMENTS: The goal of our experimental evaluation in this section is to answer the following questions. First, does pre-training a neural network via denoising improve performance on the downstream task compared to training from a random initialization? Second, how does the benefit of pre-training depend on the relationship between the upstream and downstream datasets? Our evaluation involves four realistic and challenging molecular datasets, which vary in size, compound compositions (organic or inorganic) and labelling methodology (DFT- or CCSD(T)-generated), as described below. 4.1 DATASETS AND TRAINING SETUP: Datasets. First, the main dataset we use for pre-training is PCQM4Mv2 (Nakata & Shimazaki, 2017), which contains 3.4 million organic molecules, specified by their 3D structures at equilibrium calculated using DFT.2 The molecules in PCQM4Mv2 only contain one label, however the labels are not used as denoising only requires the structures. The large scale and diversity of PCQM4Mv2 makes it well-suited for pre-training via denoising. Second, as a dataset for fine-tuning, we use QM9 (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014), which contains around 130,000 small organic molecules and is widely used as a molecular property prediction benchmark (Klicpera et al., 2020a; Fuchs et al., 2020; Satorras et al., 2021; Finzi et al., 2020; Hutchinson et al., 2021; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021; Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022; Godwin et al., 2022). Each molecule is specified by its structure alongside 12 associated molecular property labels. Third, Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) (Chanussot* et al., 2021) is a recent large benchmark of interacting surfaces and adsorbates relevant to catalyst discovery. OC20 contains various tasks, such as predicting the relaxed state energy from an initial high-energy structure (IS2RE). We explore different combinations of upstream and downstream tasks as described in Section 4.3. Lastly, DES15K (Donchev et al., 2021) is a small dataset we use for fine-tuning, which contains around 15,000 dimer geometries (i.e. molecule pairs) with non-covalent molecular 2An earlier version of this dataset without any 3D structures, called PCQM4M, was used for supervised pre-training (Ying et al., 2021), but to our knowledge, this is the first time the 3D structures from v2 have been used and in a self-supervised manner. interactions. Each pair is labelled with its interaction energy computed using the gold-standard CCSD(T) method (Bartlett & Musia\u0142, 2007). CCSD(T) is usually both more expensive and accurate than DFT, which is used for all aforementioned datasets. See Appendix D for further details and a discussion about the choice of using DFT-generated structures for pre-training. Figure 2 (right) shows what percentage of elements appearing in each of QM9, OC20 and DES15K also appear in PCQM4Mv2. Whereas QM9 is fully covered by PCQM4Mv2, we observe that DES15K has less element overlap with PCQM4Mv2 and less than < 30% of elements in OC20 are contained in PCQM4Mv2. This is owing to the fact that surface molecules in OC20 are inorganic lattices, none of which appear in PCQM4Mv2. This suggests that we can expect least transfer from PCQM4Mv2 to OC20. We also compare PCQM4Mv2 and QM9 in terms of the molecular compositions, i.e. the number of atoms of each element, that appear in each. Due to presence of isomers, both datasets contain multiple molecules with the same composition. For each molecular composition in QM9, Figure 2 (left) shows its frequency in both QM9 and PCQM4Mv2. We observe that most molecular compositions in QM9 also appear in PCQM4Mv2. We also remark that since pre-training is self-supervised using only unlabelled structures, test set contamination is not possible \u2013 in fact, PCQM4Mv2 does not have most of the labels in QM9. Training setup. GNS/GNS-TAT were implemented in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) using Haiku and Jraph (Hennigan et al., 2020; Godwin* et al., 2020). All experiments were averaged over 3 seeds. Detailed hyperparameter and hardware settings can be found in Appendices E and F. 4.2 RESULTS ON QM9: We evaluate two variants of our model on QM9 in Table 1, GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes trained from a random initialization versus pre-trained parameters. Pre-training is done on PCQM4Mv2 via denoising. For best performance on QM9, we found that using atom type masking and prediction during pre-training additionally helped (Hu et al., 2020a). We fine-tune a separate model for each of the 12 targets, as usually done on QM9, using a single pre-trained model. This is repeated for three seeds (including pre-training). Following customary practice, hyperparameters, including the noise scale for denoising during pre-training and fine-tuning, are tuned on the HOMO target and then kept fixed for all other targets. We first observe that GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes performs competitively with other models and significantly improves upon GNS with Noisy Nodes, revealing the benefit of the TAT modifications. Utilizing pre-training then further improves performance across all targets, achieving a new state-of-the-art compared to prior work for 10 out of 12 targets. Interestingly, for the electronic spatial extent target \u2329 R2 \u232a , we found GNS-TAT to perform worse than other models, which may be due to the optimal noise scale being different from that of other targets. 4.3 RESULTS ON OC20: Next, we consider the Open Catalyst 2020 benchmark focusing on the downstream task of predicting the relaxed energy from the initial structure (IS2RE). We compared GNS with Noisy Nodes trained from scratch versus using pre-trained parameters. We experimented with two options for pre-training: (1) pre-training via denoising on PCQM4Mv2, and (2) pre-training via denoising on OC20 itself. For the latter, we follow Godwin et al.\u2019s [2022] approach of letting the denoising target be the relaxed structure, while the perturbed input is a random interpolation between the initial and relaxed structures with added Gaussian noise \u2013 this corresponds to the IS2RS task with additional noise. As shown in Figure 3 (left), pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 offers no benefit for validation performance on IS2RE, however pre-training on OC20 leads to considerably faster convergence but the same final performance. The lack of transfer from PCQM4Mv2 to OC20 is likely due to the difference in nature of the two datasets and the small element overlap as discussed in Section 4.1 and Figure 2 (right). On the other hand, faster convergence from using parameters pre-trained on OC20 suggests that denoising learned meaningful features. Unsurprisingly, the final performance is unchanged since the upstream and downstream datasets are the same in this case, so pre-training with denoising is identical to the auxiliary task of applying Noisy Nodes. The performance achieved is also competitive with other models in the literature as shown in Table 8. 4.4 RESULTS ON DES15K: In our experiments so far, all downstream tasks were based on DFT-generated datasets. While DFT calculations are more expensive than using neural networks, they are relatively cheap compared to even higher quality methods such as CCSD(T) (Bartlett & Musia\u0142, 2007). In this section, we evaluate how useful pre-training on DFT-generated structures from PCQM4Mv2 is when fine-tuning on the recent DES15K dataset which contains higher quality CCSD(T)-generated interaction energies. Moreover, unlike QM9, inputs from DES15K are systems of two interacting molecules and the dataset contains only around 15,000 examples, rendering it more challenging. We compare the test performance on DES15K achieved by GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes when trained from scratch versus using pre-trained parameters from PCQM4Mv2. As a baseline, we also include pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 using 2D-based AttrMask (Hu et al., 2020a) by masking and predicting atomic numbers. Figure 3 (right) shows that using Noisy Nodes significantly improves performance compared to training from scratch, with a further improvement resulting from using pre-training via denoising. AttrMask underperforms denoising since it likely does not fully exploit the 3D structural information. Importantly, this shows that pre-training by denoising structures obtained through relatively cheap methods such as DFT can even be beneficial when fine-tuning on more expensive and smaller downstream datasets. See Appendix G.1 for similar results on another architecture. 5 ANALYSIS:  5.1 PRE-TRAINING A DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURE: To explore whether pre-training is beneficial beyond GNS/GNS-TAT, we applied pre-training via denoising to the TorchMD-NET architecture (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022). TorchMD-NET is a transformer-based architecture whose layers maintain per-atom scalar features xi \u2208 RF and vector features vi \u2208 R3\u00d7F , where F is the feature dimension, that are updated in each layer using a selfattention mechanism. We implemented denoising by using gated equivariant blocks (Weiler et al., 2018; Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021) applied to the processed scalar and vector features. The resulting vector features are then used as the noise prediction. In Table 2, we evaluate the effect of adding Noisy Nodes and pre-training to the architecture on the HOMO and LUMO targets in QM9. Pre-training yields a boost in performance, allowing the model to achieve SOTA results. Note that the results shown for TorchMD-NET are from our runs using Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis\u2019s [2022] open-source code, which led to slightly worse results than their published ones (our pre-training results still outperform their published results). Our code for experiments on TorchMD-NET is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced. 5.2 VARYING DATASET SIZES: We also investigate how downstream test performance on the HOMO target in QM9 varies as a function of the number of upstream and downstream training examples. First, we compare the performance of GNS-TAT with Noisy Nodes either trained from scratch or using pre-trained parameters for different numbers of training examples from QM9; we also include the performance of just GNS-TAT. As shown in Figure 4 (left), pre-training improves the downstream performance for all dataset sizes. The difference in test MAE also grows as the downstream training data reduces. Second, we assess the effect of varying the amount of pre-training data while fixing the downstream dataset size for both GNS and GNS-TAT as shown in Figure 4 (middle). For both models, we find that downstream performance generally improves as upstream data increases, with saturating performance for GNS-TAT. More upstream data can yield better quality representations. 5.3 VARYING MODEL SIZE: We study the benefit of pre-training as models are scaled up on large downstream datasets. Recall that the S2EF dataset in OC20 contains around 130 million DFT evaluations for catalytic systems, providing three orders of magnitude more training data than QM9. We compare the performance of four GNS models with sizes ranging from 10 million to 1.2 billion parameters scaled up by increasing the hidden layer sizes in the MLPs. Each is pre-trained via denoising using the trajectories provided for the IS2RE/IS2RS tasks as described in Section 4.3. We also compare this to a 130 million parameter variant of GNS trained from scratch. As shown in Figure 4 (right), the pre-trained models continue to benefit from larger model sizes.We also observe that pre-training is beneficial, as the model trained from scratch underperforms in comparison: the 130 million parameters model trained from scratch is outperformed by a pre-trained model of less than half the size. 5.4 PRE-TRAINING IMPROVES FORCE PREDICTION: As shown in Section 3.2.1, denoising structures corresponds to learning an approximate force field directly from equilibrium structures. We explore whether pre-training via denoising would therefore also improve models trained to predict atomic forces. We compare the performance of TorchMD-NET for force prediction on the MD17 (aspirin) dataset with and without pre-training on PCQM4Mv2. Table 3 shows that pre-training improves force prediction. We also assess the effect of pre-training on the OC20 dataset for force prediction in Appendix G.3, similarly finding an improvement due to pre-training. 5.5 FREEZING PRE-TRAINED PARAMETERS Finally, we perform an experiment to assess how useful the features learned by pre-training are if they are not fine-tuned for the downstream task but kept fixed instead. Specifically, on the HOMO target in QM9, we freeze the backbone of the model and fine-tune only the decoder (cf. Appendix A). To evaluate this, we compare it to using random parameters from initialization for the model\u2019s backbone, which allows us to isolate how useful the pre-trained features are. As described in Appendix A, the decoder is a simple module involving no message-passing. Figure 5 shows that only training the decoder while keeping the pre-trained parameters fixed results in test MAE of 40 meV, which is worse than fine-tuning the entire model but substantially better than the performance of >100 meV in test MAE resulting from training the decoder when the remaining parameters are randomly initialized. This suggests that the features learned by denoising are more discriminative for downstream prediction than random features. We note that training only the decoder is also substantially faster than training the entire network \u2013 one batch on a single V100 GPU takes 15ms, which is 50\u00d7 faster than one batch using 16 TPUs for the full network. 6 LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK: We have shown that pre-training can significantly improve performance for various tasks. One additional advantage of pre-trained models is that they can be shared in the community, allowing practitioners to fine-tune models on their datasets. However, unlike vision and NLP, molecular networks vary widely and the community has not yet settled on a \u201cstandard\u201d architecture, making pre-trained weights less reusable. Moreover, the success of pre-training inevitably depends on the relationship between the upstream and downstream datasets. In the context of molecular property prediction, understanding what aspects of the upstream data distribution must match the downstream data distribution for transfer is an important direction for future work. More generally, pre-training models on large datasets incurs a computational cost. However, our results show that pre-training for 3D molecular prediction does not require the same scale as large NLP and vision models. We discuss considerations on the use of compute and broader impact in Appendix C. 7 CONCLUSION: We investigated pre-training neural networks by denoising in the space of 3D molecular structures. We showed that denoising in this context is equivalent to learning a force field, motivating its ability to learn useful representations and shedding light on successful applications of denoising in other works (Godwin et al., 2022). This technique enabled us to utilize existing large datasets of 3D structures for improving performance on various downstream molecular property prediction tasks, setting a new SOTA in some cases such as QM9. More broadly, this bridges the gap between the utility of pre-training in vision/NLP and molecular property prediction from structures. We hope that this approach will be particularly impactful for applications of deep learning to scientific problems. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT Our theoretical results, complete with assumptions and proofs, are included in Section 3.2.1 and Appendix B. The code to reproduce our experiments on the TorchMD-NET architecture is included in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon publication. We report hardware setup with training times in Appendix E and detailed hyperparameter settings in Appendix F. Datasets are described with their respective licenses in Appendix D. A ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS: A.1 STANDARD GNS As our base model architecture we chose a Graph Net Simulator (GNS) (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), which consists of an ENCODER which constructs a graph representation from the input S, a PROCESSOR of repeated message passing blocks that update the latent graph representation, and a DECODER which produces predictions. Our implementation follows Godwin et al.\u2019s [2022] modifications to enable molecular and graph-level property predictions which has been shown to achieve strong results across different molecular prediction tasks without relying on problem-specific features. In the ENCODER, we represent the set of atoms S = {(a1,p1), (a2,p2), . . . , (a|S|,p|S|)} as a directed graph G = (V,E) where V = {v1,v2, . . . ,v|S|} and E = {ei,j}i,j are the sets of \u201cfeaturized\u201d vertices and edges, respectively. Edges ei,j \u2208 E are constructed whenever the distance between the i-th and j-th atoms is less than the connectivity radius Rcut, in which case we connect vi and vj with a directed edge ei,j from i to j that is a featurization of the displacement vector pj \u2212 pi. Meanwhile, for the i-th atom, vi is given by a learnable vector embedding of the atomic number ai. The PROCESSOR consists of L message-passing steps that produce intermediate graphs G1, . . . , GL (with the same connectivity structure as the initial one). Each of these steps computes the sum of a shortcut connection from the previous graph, and the application of an Interaction Network (Battaglia et al., 2016). Interaction Networks first update each edge feature by applying an \u201cedge update function\u201d to a combination of the existing feature and the features of the two connected vertices. They then update each vertex feature by applying a \u201cvertex update function\u201d to a combination of the existing feature and the (new) edge features of incoming edges. In GNS, edge update functions are 3 hidden layer fully-connected MLPs, using a \u201cshifted softplus\u201d (ssp(x) = log(0.5ex + 0.5)) activation function, applied to the concatenation of the relevant edge and vertex features, followed by a layer normalization layer. Vertex update functions are similar, but are applied to the concatenation of the relevant vertex feature and sum over relevant edge features. In our implementation of GNS we applied the same PROCESSOR in sequence three times (with shared parameters), with the output of each being decoded to produce a prediction and corresponding loss value. The loss for the whole model is then given by the average of these. (Test-time predictions are meanwhile computed using only the output of the final PROCESSOR.) The DECODER is responsible for computing graph-level and vertex-level predictions from the output of each PROCESSOR. Vertex-level predictions, such as noise as described in Section 3.2, are decoded using an MLP applied to each vertex feature. Graph-level predictions (e.g. energies) are produced by applying an MLP to each vertex feature, aggregating the result over vertices (via a sum), and then applying another MLP to the result. Private & Confidential A.2 GNS WITH TAILORED ACTIVATION TRANSFORMATION (GNS-TAT) Tailored Activation Transformation (TAT) (Zhang et al., 2022) is a method for initializing and transforming neural networks to make them easier to train, and is based on a similar method called Deep Kernel Shaping (DKS) (Martens et al., 2021). TAT controls the propagation of \u201cq values\u201d, which are initialization-time approximations to dimension-normalized squared norms of the network\u2019s layer-wise activation vectors, and \u201cc values\u201d, which are cosine similarities between such vectors (for different inputs). In other words, q values approximate \u2225z(x)\u22252/ dim(z(x)), where z(x) denotes a layer\u2019s output as a function of the network\u2019s input x, and c values approximate z(x)\u22a4z(x\u2032)/(\u2225z(x)\u2225\u2225z(x\u2032)\u2225), where x\u2032 is another possible network input. In standard deep networks, c values will converge to a constant value c\u221e \u2208 [0, 1], so that \u201cgeometric information\u201d is lost, which leads to training difficulties (Martens et al., 2021). DKS/TAT prevents this convergence through a combination of careful weight initialization, and transformations to the network\u2019s activation functions and sum/average layers. Oversmoothing (Chen et al., 2019; Cai & Wang, 2020; Rong et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zhao & Akoglu, 2020; Do et al., 2021) is a phenomenon observed in GNN architectures where vertex/edge features all converge to approximately the same value with depth, and is associated with training difficulties. It is reminiscent of how, when c\u221e = 1, feature vectors will converge with depth to a constant input-independent vector in standard deep networks. It therefore seems plausible that applying TAT to GNNs may help with the oversmoothing problem and thus improve training performance. Unfortunately, the GNS architecture violates two key assumptions of TAT. Firstly, the sums over edge features (performed in the vertex update functions) violate the assumption that all sum operations must be between the outputs of linear layers with independently sampled initial weights. Secondly, GNS networks have multiple inputs for which information needs to be independently preserved and propagated to the output, while DKS/TAT assumes a single input (or multiple inputs whose representations evolve independently in the network). To address these issues we introduce a new initialization scheme called \u201cEdge-Delta\u201d, which initializes to zero the weights that multiply incoming vertex features in the edge update functions (and treats these weights as absent for the purpose of computing the initial weight variance). This approach is inspired by the use of the \u201cDelta initialization\" (Balduzzi et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2018) for convolutional networks in DKS/TAT, which initializes filter weights of the non-central locations to zero, thus allowing geometric information, in the form of c values, to propagate independently for each location in the feature map. When using the Edge-Delta initialization, edge features propagate independently of each other (and of vertex features), through what is essentially a standard deep residual network (with edge update functions acting as the residual branches), which we will refer to as the \u201cedge network\u201d. Given the use of Edge-Delta we can then apply TAT to GNS as follows3. First, we replace GNS\u2019s activation functions with TAT\u2019s transformed Leaky-ReLU activation functions (or \u201cTailored ReLUs\u201d), which we compute with TAT\u2019s \u03b7 parameter set to 0.8, and its \u201csubnetwork maximizing function\u201d defined on the edge network4. We also replace each sum involving shortcut connections with weighted sums, whose weights are 0.9 and \u221a 1\u2212 0.92 for the shortcut and non-shortcut branches respectively. We retain the use of layer normalization layers in the edge/vertex update functions, but move them to before the first fully-connected layer, as this seems to give the best performance. As required by TAT, we use a standard Gaussian fan-in initialization for the weights, and a zero initialization for the biases, with Edge-Delta used only for the first linear layer of the edge update functions. Finally, we replace the sum used to aggregate vertex features in the DECODER with an average. See Figures 6 and 7 for an illustration of these changes. We experimented with an analogous \u201cVertex-Delta\u201d initialization, which initializes to zero weights in the vertex update functions that multiply summed edge features, but found that Edge-Delta gave the best results. This might be because the edge features, which encode distances between vertices (and are best preserved with the Edge-Delta approach), are generally much more informative than the vertex features in molecular property prediction tasks. We also ran informal ablation studies, and found that each of our changes to the original GNS model contributed to improved results, with the use of Edge-Delta and weighted shortcut sums being especially important. B DENOISING AS LEARNING A FORCE FIELD: We specify a molecular structure as x = (x(1), . . . ,x(N)) \u2208 R3N , where x(i) \u2208 R3 is the coordinate of atom i. Let E(x) denote the total (potential) energy of x, such that \u2212\u2207xE(x) are the forces on the atoms. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, learning the force field, i.e. the mapping x 7\u2192 \u2212\u2207xE(x), 3Note that Edge-Delta initialization is compatible with TAT, since for the purposes of q/c value propagation, zero-initialized connections in the network can be treated as absent. 4For the purposes of computing the subnetwork maximizing function we ignore the rest of the network and just consider the edge network. While the layer normalization layer (which we move before the MLP) technically depends on the vertex features, this dependency can be ignored as long as the q values of these features is 1 (which will be true given the complete set of changes we make to the GNS architecture). is a reasonable pre-training objective. Furthermore, learning the force field can be viewed as scorematching if we define the distribution pphysical(x) \u221d exp(\u2212E(x)) and observe that the score of pphysical is the force field: \u2207x log pphysical(x) = \u2212\u2207xE(x). However, a technical caveat is that pphysical is an improper probability density, because it cannot be normalized due to the translation invariance of E. Writing the translation of a structure as x + t := (x(1) + t, . . . ,x(N) + t) where t \u2208 R3 is a constant vector, we have E(x + t) = E(x). This implies that the normalizing constant \u222b R3N pphysical(x) dx diverges to infinity. To remedy this, we can restrict ourselves to the (3N\u22123)-dimensional subspace V := {x \u2208 R3N | \u2211 i x (i) = 0} \u2286 R3N consisting of the mean-centered structures, over which pphysical can be defined as a normalizable distribution. Proceeding similarly as Section 3.2.1, let x1, . . . ,xn \u2208 V be a set of mean-centered equilibrium structures. For any x\u0303 \u2208 V , we now approximate pphysical(x\u0303) \u2248 q\u03c3(x\u0303) := 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi), where the Gaussian distributions q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) are defined on V as: q\u03c3(x\u0303 | xi) = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c3)(3N\u22123)/2 exp ( \u2212 1 2\u03c32 \u2225x\u0303\u2212 xi\u22252 ) . For convenience, we have expressed structures as vectors in the ambient space R3N , however they are restricted to lie in the smaller space V . Note that the normalizing constant accounts for the fact that V is (3N \u2212 3)-dimensional. As before, we define q0(x) = 1n \u2211n i=1 \u03b4(x = xi) to be the empirical distribution and q\u03c3(x\u0303,x) = q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)q0(x). The score-matching objective is given by: J1(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u22252 ] , (5) where the expectation is now over V . As shown by Vincent (2011), minimizing the objective above is equivalent to the minimizing the following objective: J2(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u2212\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u22252 ] . (6) This is recognized as a denoising objective, because \u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x) = (x \u2212 x\u0303)/\u03c32. A practical implication of this analysis is that the noise (x \u2212 x\u0303)/\u03c32 \u2208 V should be mean-centered, which is intuitive since it is impossible to predict a translational component in the noise. We include a proof of the equivalence between Equations (5) and (6) for completeness: Proposition 1 (Vincent (2011)). The minimization objectives J1(\u03b8) and J2(\u03b8) are equivalent. Proof. We first observe: J1(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u22252 ] \u2212 2Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u27e9] + C1 J2(\u03b8) = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [ \u2225GNN\u03b8(x\u0303)\u22252 ] \u2212 2Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u27e9] + C2, where C1, C2 are constants independent of \u03b8. Therefore, it suffices to show that the middle terms on the RHS are equal. Since expectations over q\u03c3(x\u0303) and q\u03c3(x\u0303,x) are restricted to V \u2286 R3N , we apply a change of basis to write them as integrals against the (3N\u22123)-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Pick an orthonormal basis {v1, . . . ,v3N\u22123} \u2286 R3N for V and let PV = [v1, . . . ,v3N\u22123] \u2208 R3N\u00d73(N\u22121) be the projection matrix, so z = P \u22baV x expresses a mean-centered structure x in terms of the coordinates of the chosen basis for V . Noting that PV has orthonormal columns and that it yields a bijection between V and R3N\u22123, we calculate: Eq\u03c3(x\u0303) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303)\u27e9] = \u222b R3N\u22123 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303)\u27e8GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303),\u2207 log q\u03c3(PV z\u0303)\u27e9dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303) \u2329 GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303), \u2207q\u03c3(PV z\u0303) q\u03c3(PV z\u0303) \u232a dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 \u27e8GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303),\u2207q\u03c3(PV z\u0303)\u27e9dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 \u2329 GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303), 1 n n\u2211 i=1 \u2207q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi) \u232a dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 \u2329 GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303), 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi)\u2207 log q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi) \u232a dz\u0303 = \u222b R3N\u22123 1 n n\u2211 i=1 q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi) \u27e8GNN\u03b8(PV z\u0303),\u2207 log q\u03c3(PV z\u0303 | xi)\u27e9dz\u0303 = Eq\u03c3(x\u0303,x) [\u27e8GNN\u03b8(x\u0303),\u2207x\u0303 log q\u03c3(x\u0303 | x)\u27e9] C BROADER IMPACT: Who may benefit from this work? Molecular property prediction works towards a range of applications in materials design, chemistry, and drug discovery. Wider use of pre-trained models may accelerate progress in a similar manner to how pre-trained language or image models have enabled practitioners to avoid training on large datasets from scratch. Pre-training via denoising is simple to implement and can be immediately adopted to improve performance on a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks. As research converges on more standardized architectures, we expect shared pre-trained weights will become more common across the community. Potential negative impact and ethical considerations. Pre-training models on large structure datasets incurs additional computational cost when compared to training a potentially smaller model with less capacity from scratch. Environmental mitigation should be taken into account when pretraining large models (Patterson et al., 2021). However, the computational cost of pre-training can and should be offset by sharing pre-trained embeddings when possible. Moreover, in our ablations of upstream dataset sizes for GNS-TAT, we observed that training on a subset of PCQM4Mv2 was sufficient for strong downstream performance. In future work, we plan to investigate how smaller subsets with sufficient diversity can be used to minimize computational requirements, e.g. by requiring fewer gradient steps. D DATASETS: PCQM4Mv2. The main dataset we use for pre-training is PCQM4Mv2 (Nakata & Shimazaki, 2017) (license: CC BY 4.0), which contains 3,378,606 organic molecules, specified by their 3D structures at equilibrium (atom types and coordinates) calculated using DFT. Molecules in PCQM4Mv2 have around 30 atoms on average and vary in terms of their composition, with the dataset containing 22 unique elements in total. The molecules in PCQM4Mv2 only contain one label, unlike e.g. QM9, which contains 12 labels per molecule, however we do not use these labels as denoising only requires the structures. QM9. QM9 is a dataset (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014) (license: CCBY 4.0) with approximately 130,000 small organic molecules containing up to nine heavy C, N, O, F atoms, specified by their structures. Each molecule has 12 different labels corresponding to different molecular properties, such as highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and internal energy, which we use for fine-tuning. OC20. Open Catalyst 2020 (Chanussot* et al., 2021) (OC20, license: CC Attribution 4.0) is a recent large benchmark containing trajectories of interacting surfaces and adsorbates that are relevant to catalyst discovery and optimization. This dataset contains three tasks: predicting the relaxed state energy from the initial structure (IS2RE), predicting the relaxed structure from the initial structure (IS2RS) and predicting the energy and forces given the structure at any point in the trajectory (S2EF). For IS2RE and IS2RS, there are 460,000 training examples, where each data point is a trajectory of a surface-adsorbate molecule pair starting with a high-energy initial structure that is relaxed towards a low-energy, equilibrium structure. For S2EF, there are 113 million examples of (non-equilibrium) structures with their associated energies and per-atom forces. DES15K. DES15K (Donchev et al., 2021) (license: CC0 1.0) is a small dataset containing around 15,000 interacting molecule pairs, specifically dimer geometries with non-covalent molecular interactions. Each pair is labelled with the associated interaction energy computed using the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) (Bartlett & Musia\u0142, 2007), which is widely regarded as the gold-standard method in electronic structure theory. Usage of DFT-generated structures for pre-training. The structures in PCQM4Mv2 are obtained using DFT calculations, which in principle could have also been used to generate labels for molecular properties in DFT-generated downstream datasets, such as QM9. However, there are multiple reasons why denoising remains a desirable pre-training objective in such settings. First, although there is a computational cost for generating datasets such as PCQM4Mv2, it is now openly available and part of our aim is to understand how to leverage such datasets for tasks on other datasets (analogous to how ImageNet is expensive to build, but once it is available, it is important to understand how it can improve downstream performance on other datasets). Second, even if PCQM4Mv2 contained all the labels in QM9, pre-training via denoising structures allows one to pre-train a single, label-agnostic model which can be individually fine-tuned on any of the targets in QM9. This is substantially cheaper than per-target pre-training, and the resulting pre-trained model is also re-useable for differing needs and downstream tasks. In other settings where the downstream dataset is generated using more expensive methods than DFT, pre-training via denoising DFT-relaxed structures can also be helpful and has a clear benefit, as shown by our experiment on the CCSD(T)-generated dataset DES15K where denoising on PCQM4Mv2 improves performance for a downstream task involving a \u201chigher\u201d level of theory such as CCSD(T). Generally, we emphasize that the methodology of denoising structures can be applied to any dataset of structures (regardless of whether they are computed using DFT or not). We hope that denoising will be useful in the future for learning representations by pre-training on structures obtained through other methods such as experimental data (in which case labeling may be expensive) and databases generated by other models such as AlphaFold (where only structures are available) (Jumper et al., 2021). E EXPERIMENT SETUP AND COMPUTE RESOURCES: Below, we list details on our experiment setup and hardware resources used. GNS & GNS-TAT. GNS-TAT training for QM9, PCQM4Mv2 and DES15K was done on a cluster of 16 TPU v3 devices and evaluation on a single V100 device. GNS training for OC20 was done on 8 TPU v4 devices, with the exception of the 1.2 billion parameters variant of the model, which was trained on 64 TPU v4 devices. Pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 was executed for 3 \u00b7 105 gradient updates (approximately 1.5 days of training). Fine-tuning experiments were run until convergence for QM9 (106 gradient updates taking approximately 2 days) and DES15K (105 gradient updates taking approximately 4 hours) and stopped after 5 \u00b7 105 gradient updates on OC20 (2.5 days) to minimize hardware use (the larger models keep benefiting from additional gradient updates). TorchMD-NET. We implemented denoising for TorchMD-NET on top of Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis\u2019s [2022] open-source code.5 Models were trained on QM9 using data parallelism over two NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPUs. Pre-training on PCQM4Mv2 was done using three GPUs to accommodate the larger molecules while keeping the batch size approximately the same as QM9. All hyperparameters except the learning rate schedule were kept fixed at the defaults. Pre-training took roughly 24 hours, whereas fine-tuning took around 16 hours. 5Available on GitHub at: https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net. Hyperparameter optimization. We note that effective pre-training via denoising requires sweeping noise values, as well as loss co-efficients for denoising and atom type recovery. For GNS/GNS-TAT, we relied on the hyperparameters published by Godwin et al. (2022) but determined new noise values for pre-training and fine-tuning by tuning over a grid of approximately 5 values each on PCQM4Mv2 and QM9 (for the HOMO target). We used the same values for DES15K without modification. We also ran a similar number of experiments to determine cosine cycle parameters for learning rates. F HYPERPARAMETERS: We report the main hyperparameters used for GNS and GNS-TAT below. G ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: G.1 PERFORMANCE OF TORCHMD-NET ON DES15K In addition to the experiments involving GNS-TAT on DES15K in Section 4.4, we also consider the performance of TorchMD-NET on DES15K with and without pre-training on PCQM4Mv2. As shown in Table 7, TorchMD-NET outperforms GNS-TAT when trained from scratch, and pre-training then yields a further boost in performance as with GNS-TAT. G.2 COMPARISON OF OC20 IS2RE PRE-TRAINING PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER ARCHITECTURES Table 8 compares the performance of our models with various other architectures proposed in prior work. GNS yields SOTA performance on each of the four validation sets for the direct IS2RE task. As discussed in Section 4.3 and shown in Figure 3 (left), the model pre-trained on OC20 itself achieves SOTA performance with faster convergence than all other GNS variants. Note that since we pre-train on OC20 itself, the pre-trained model performs equally well at convergence as the model trained from scratch with noisy nodes (cf. Section 4.3). G.3 PRE-TRAINING VIA DENOISING FOR FORCE PREDICTION ON OC20 Recall that in Section 5.4 we explored whether pre-training also improves force prediction models, given the link between denoising and learning forces as described in Section 3.2.1. In this section, we consider a second experiment for force models. The OC20 dataset contains a force prediction task (S2EF), where a model is trained to predict point-wise energy and forces (each point being a single DFT evaluation during a relaxation trajectory) from a given 3D structure. Tables 9 and 10 show the performance of GNS when trained from scratch vs. pre-trained via denoising on equilibrium structures in OC20, as described in Section 4.3. We show two metrics for measuring force prediction performance on each of the four validation datasets: mean absolute error (lower is better) and cosine similarity (higher is better). We observe that the pre-trained model improves upon the model trained from scratch for both metrics and all four validation datasets, with improvements up to 15%."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will review the paper \"Pre-training via Denoising for Molecular Property Prediction\" for ICLR 2023.

Your contribution as a reviewer is paramount to creating an exciting and high-quality program. We ask that:\\n\\nYour reviews are timely and substantive.\\nYou follow the reviewing guidelines below.\u00a0\\nYou adhere to our Code of Ethics in your role as a reviewer. You must also adhere to our Code of Conduct.\\n\\nThis guide is intended to help you understand the ICLR 2023 decision process and your role within it. It contains:\\n\\nAn outline of the main reviewer tasks\\nStep-by-step reviewing instructions (especially relevant for reviewers that are new to ICLR)\\nReview examples\\nAn FAQ.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\nWe\u2019re counting on you\\nAs a reviewer you are central to the program creation process for ICLR 2023. Your Area Chairs (ACs), Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and the Program Chairs (PCs) will rely greatly on your expertise and your diligent and thorough reviews to make decisions on each paper. Therefore, your role as a reviewer is critical to ensuring a strong program for ICLR 2023.\\nHigh-quality reviews are also very valuable for helping authors improve their work, whether it is eventually accepted by ICLR 2023, or not. Therefore it is important to treat each valid ICLR 2023 submission with equal care.\\nAs a token of our appreciation for your essential work, top reviewers will be acknowledged permanently on the ICLR 2023 website. Furthermore, top and high quality reviewers will receive special acknowledgement during the opening ceremony and free registration to ICLR 2023.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nMain reviewer tasks\\nThe main reviewer tasks and dates are as follows:\\n\\nCreate or update your OpenReview profile (September 30 2022)\\nBid on papers (September 30 2022 - October 06 2022)\\nWrite a constructive, thorough and timely review (October 12 2022 - October 24 2022)\\nInitial paper reviews released (November 4 2022)\\nDiscuss with authors and other reviewers to clarify and improve the paper (November 4 2022 - November 18 2022)\\nFlag any potential CoE violations and/or concerns (by November 18 2022)\\nProvide a recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (by November 18 2022)\\nVirtual Meeting with AC if paper you reviewed falls into borderline papers (November 18 2022 - December 12 2022)\\nProvide a final recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (after Virtual Meeting)\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\nCode of Ethics\\nAll ICLR participants, including reviewers, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics). All reviewers are required to read the Code of Ethics and adhere to it. The Code of Ethics applies to all conference participation, including paper submission, reviewing, and paper discussion.\u00a0\\nAs part of the review process, reviewers are asked to raise potential violations of the ICLR Code of Ethics. Note that authors are encouraged to discuss questions and potential issues regarding the Code of Ethics as part of their submission. This discussion is not counted against the maximum page limit of the paper and should be included as a separate section.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReviewing a submission: step-by-step\\nSummarized in one sentence, a review aims to determine whether a submission will bring sufficient value to the community and contribute new knowledge. The process can be broken down into the following main reviewer tasks:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRead the paper: It\u2019s important to carefully read through the entire paper, and to look up any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself sufficient time for this step.\\nWhile reading, consider the following:\\n\\nObjective of the work: What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations as to potential value and impact.\\nStrong points: is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible, does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?\\nWeak points: is it weak in any of the aspects listed in b.?\\nBe mindful of potential biases and try to be open-minded about the value and interest a paper can hold for the entire ICLR community, even if it may not be very interesting for you.\\n\\n\\nAnswer four key questions for yourself, to make a recommendation to Accept or Reject:\\n\\nWhat is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?\\nIs the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\\nDoes the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\\nWhat is the significance of the work? Does it contribute new knowledge and sufficient value to the community? Note, this does not necessarily require state-of-the-art results. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge (incl., empirical, theoretical, for practitioners, etc).\\n\\n\\nWrite and submit your initial review, organizing it as follows:\u00a0\\n\\nSummarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.\\nList strong and weak points of the paper. Be as comprehensive as possible.\\nClearly state your initial recommendation (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\\nProvide supporting arguments for your recommendation.\\nAsk questions you would like answered by the authors to help you clarify your understanding of the paper and provide the additional evidence you need to be confident in your assessment.\u00a0\\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\\n\\n\\nComplete the CoE report: ICLR has adopted the following Code of Ethics (CoE). When submitting your review, you\u2019ll be asked to complete a CoE report for the paper. The report is a simple form with two questions. The first asks whether there is a potential violation of the CoE. The second is relevant only if there is a potential violation and asks the reviewer to explain why there may be a potential violation. In order to answer these questions, it is therefore important that you read the CoE before starting your reviews. \\n\\t\u00a0\\nEngage in discussion: The discussion phase at ICLR is different from most conferences in the AI/ML community. During this phase, reviewers, authors and area chairs engage in asynchronous discussion and authors are allowed to revise their submissions to address concerns that arise. It is crucial that you are actively engaged during this phase. Maintain a spirit of openness to changing your initial recommendation (either to a more positive or more negative) rating.\\nBorderline paper meeting: This year, we are introducing a new program for ACs to (virtually) meet and discuss with reviewers only for borderline cases. ACs will reach out to schedule this meeting. This is to ensure active discussions among reviewers, and well-thought-out decisions. ACs will schedule the meeting and facilitate the discussion. For a productive discussion, it is important to familiarize yourself with other reviewers' feedback prior to the meeting. Please note that we will be leveraging information for reviewers who failed to attend this meeting (excluding emergencies).\u00a0\\nProvide final recommendation: Update your review, taking into account the new information collected during the discussion phase, and any revisions to the submission. State your reasoning and what did/didn\u2019t change your recommendation throughout the discussion phase.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nFor great in-depth resources on reviewing, see these resources:\\n\\nDaniel Dennet, Criticising with Kindness.\\nComprehensive advice: Mistakes Reviewers Make\\nViews from multiple reviewers: Last minute reviewing advice\\nPerspective from instructions to Area Chairs: Dear ACs.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReview Examples\\nHere are two sample reviews from previous conferences that give an example of what we consider a good review for the case of leaning-to-accept and leaning-to-reject.\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Accept\\nThis paper proposes a method, Dual-AC, for optimizing the actor (policy) and critic (value function) simultaneously which takes the form of a zero-sum game resulting in a principled method for using the critic to optimize the actor. In order to achieve that, they take the linear programming approach of solving the Bellman optimality equations, outline the deficiencies of this approach, and propose solutions to mitigate those problems. The discussion on the deficiencies of the naive LP approach is mostly well done. Their main contribution is extending the single step LP formulation to a multi-step dual form that reduces the bias and makes the connection between policy and value function optimization much clearer without losing convexity by applying a regularization. They perform an empirical study in the Inverted Double Pendulum domain to conclude that their extended algorithm outperforms the naive linear programming approach without the improvements. Lastly, there are empirical experiments done to conclude the superior performance of Dual-AC in contrast to other actor-critic algorithms.\u00a0\\nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, with the caveat for some clarifications on the theory and experiments. Given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score.\u00a0\\nFor the theory, there are a few steps that need clarification and further clarification on novelty. For novelty, it is unclear if Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are both being stated as novel results. It looks like Theorem 2 has already been shown in \\\"Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision Problem in Nearly-Linear Running Time\u201d. There is a statement that \u201cChen & Wang (2016); Wang (2017) apply stochastic first-order algorithms (Nemirovski et al., 2009) for the one-step Lagrangian of the LP problem in reinforcement learning setting. However, as we discussed in Section 3, their algorithm is restricted to tabular parametrization\u201d. Is your Theorem 2 somehow an extension? Is Theorem 3 completely new?\\nThis is particularly called into question due to the lack of assumptions about the function class for value functions. It seems like the value function is required to be able to represent the true value function, which can be almost as restrictive as requiring tabular parameterizations (which can represent the true value function). This assumption seems to be used right at the bottom of Page 17, where U^{pi*} = V^*. Further, eta_v must be chosen to ensure that it does not affect (constrain) the optimal solution, which implies it might need to be very small. More about conditions on eta_v would be illuminating.\u00a0\\nThere is also one step in the theorem that I cannot verify. On Page 18, how is the squared removed for difference between U and Upi? The transition from the second line of the proof to the third line is not clear. It would also be good to more clearly state on page 14 how you get the first inequality, for || V^* ||_{2,mu}^2.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed.\\n1. It would have been better to also show the performance graphs with and without the improvements for multiple domains.\\n2. The central contribution is extending the single step LP to a multi-step formulation. It would be beneficial to empirically demonstrate how increasing k (the multi-step parameter) affects the performance gains.\\n3. Increasing k also comes at a computational cost. I would like to see some discussions on this and how long dual-AC takes to converge in comparison to the other algorithms tested (PPO and TRPO).\\n4. The authors concluded the presence of local convexity based on hessian inspection due to the use of path regularization. It was also mentioned that increasing the regularization parameter size increases the convergence rate. Empirically, how does changing the regularization parameter affect the performance in terms of reward maximization? In the experimental section of the appendix, it is mentioned that multiple regularization settings were tried but their performance is not mentioned. Also, for the regularization parameters that were tried, based on hessian inspection, did they all result in local convexity? A bit more discussion on these choices would be helpful.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nMinor comments:\\n1. Page 2: In equation 5, there should not be a 'ds' in the dual variable constraint\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Reject\\nThis paper introduces a variation on temporal difference learning for the function approximation case that attempts to resolve the issue of over-generalization across temporally-successive states. The new approach is applied to both linear and non-linear function approximation, and for prediction and control problems. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments in classic benchmark control domains (Mountain Car and Acrobot), and in Pong.\\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or practice, (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve (nor differentiates it from the usual problem of generalizing well), (3) the experiments are difficult to understand, missing many details, and generally do not support a significant contribution, and (4) the paper is imprecise and unpolished.\\nMain argument\\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that the problem it is trying to solve is a real thing. There is no experiment in this paper that clearly shows how this temporal generalization problem is different from the need to generalize well with function approximation. The paper points to references to establish the existence of the problem, but for example the Durugkar and Stone paper is a workshop paper and the conference version of that paper was rejected from ICLR 2018 and the reviewers highlighted serious issues with the paper\u2014that is not work to build upon. Further the paper under review here claims this problem is most pressing in the non-linear case, but the analysis in section 4.1 is for the linear case.\u00a0\\nThe resultant algorithm does not seem well justified, and has a different fixed point than TD, but there is no discussion of this other than section 4.4, which does not make clear statements about the correctness of the algorithm or what it converges to. Can you provide a proof or any kind of evidence that the proposed approach is sound, or how it\u2019s fixed point relates to TD?\\nThe experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches. There are so many missing details it is difficult to draw many conclusions:\\n\\nWhat was the policy used in exp1 for policy evaluation in MC?\\nWhy Fourier basis features?\\nIn MC with DQN how did you adjust the parameters and architecture for the MC task?\\nWas the reward in MC and Acrobot -1 per step or something else\\nHow did you tune the parameters in the MC and Acrobot experiments?\\nWhy so few runs in MC, none of the results presented are significant?\\nWhy is the performance so bad in MC?\\nDid you evaluate online learning or do tests with the greedy policy?\\nHow did you initialize the value functions and weights?\\nWhy did you use experience replay for the linear experiments?\\nIN MC and Acrobot why only a one layer MLP?\\n\\nIgnoring all that, the results are not convincing. Most of the results in the paper are not statistically significant. The policy evaluation results in MC show little difference to regular TD. The Pong results show DQN is actually better. This makes the reader wonder if the result with DQN on MC and Acrobot are only worse because you did not properly tune DQN for those domains, whereas the default DQN architecture is well tuned for Atari and that is why you method is competitive in the smaller domains.\u00a0\\nThe differences in the \u201caverage change in value plots\u201d are very small if the rewards are -1 per step. Can you provide some context to understand the significance of this difference? In the last experiment linear FA and MC, the step-size is set equal for all methods\u2014this is not a valid comparison. Your method may just work better with alpha = 0.1.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nThe paper has many imprecise parts, here are a few:\\n\\nThe definition of the value function would be approximate not equals unless you specify some properties of the function approximation architecture. Same for the Bellman equation\\nequation 1 of section 2.1 is neither an algorithm or a loss function\\nTD does not minimize the squared TD. Saying that is the objective function of TD learning in not true\\nend of section 2.1 says \u201cIt is computed as\u201d but the following equation just gives a form for the partial derivative\\nequation 2, x is not bounded\u00a0\\nYou state TC-loss has an unclear solution property, I don\u2019t know what that means and I don\u2019t think your approach is well justified either\\nSection 4.1 assumes linear FA, but its implied up until paragraph 2 that it has not assumed linear\\ntreatment of n_t in alg differs from appendix (t is no time episode number)\\nYour method has a n_t parameter that is adapted according to a schedule seemingly giving it an unfair advantage over DQN.\\nOver-claim not supported by the results: \u201cwe see that HR-TD is able to find a representation that is better at keeping the target value separate than TC is \u201c. The results do not show this.\\nSection 4.4 does not seem to go anywhere or produce and tangible conclusions\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to follow how the prox operator is used in the development of the alg, this could use some higher level explanation\\nIntro p2 is about bootstrapping, use that term and remove the equations\\nIt\u2019s not clear why you are talking about stochastic vs deterministic in P3\\nPerhaps you should compare against a MC method in the experiments to demonstrate the problem with TD methods and generalization\\nSection 2: \u201ccan often be a regularization term\u201d >> can or must be?\\nupdate law is an odd term\\n\u00a0tends to alleviate\u201d >> odd phrase\\nsection 4 should come before section 3\\nAlg 1 in not helpful because it just references an equation\\nsection 4.4 is very confusing, I cannot follow the logic of the statements\u00a0\\nQ learning >> Q-learning\\nNot sure what you mean with the last sentence of p2 section 5\\nwhere are the results for Acrobot linear function approximation\\nappendix Q-learning with linear FA is not DQN (table 2)\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nFAQ for Reviewers\\nQ. The review I just submitted is not appearing! Did it go thru?\\nA. There seems to be some delay in the system for you to see your reviews. Just give a bit of time and refresh again.\\n\u00a0\\nQ. What is the borderline paper meeting between AC and reviewers about?\\nA. This year we require ACs to meet with reviewers for all borderline papers (defined and announced by PCs once all reviews are received). There will be one meeting per borderline paper. Once we receive all reviews, we will let ACs know which papers fall into this bucket. ACs will then schedule and run the meetings with the reviewers of the papers in question.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: What if I can not attend the meeting?\\nA: Please work with your AC to find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. Note that the discussion phase is roughly 1 month long, and overlaps with the NeurIPS conference, in case in-person meeting is preferred. All reviewers agreed to participate in review meetings when they accepted the reviewer invitations. An AC has right to\u00a0 downweight the review of reviewers who refuse to attend the meeting.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: How should I use supplementary material?\\nA: It is not necessary to read supplementary material but such material can often answer questions that arise while reading the main paper, so consider looking there before asking authors.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: How should I handle a policy violation?\\nA: To flag a CoE violation related to a submission, please indicate it when submitting the CoE report for that paper. The AC will work with the PC and the ethics board to resolve the case. To discuss other violations (e.g. plagiarism, double submission, paper length, formatting, etc.), please contact either the AC/SAC or the PC as appropriate. You can do this by sending a confidential comment with the appropriate readership restrictions.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: Am I allowed to ask for additional experiments?\\nA: You can ask for additional experiments. New experiments should not significantly change the content of the submission. Rather, they should be limited in scope and serve to more thoroughly validate existing results from the submission.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: If a submission does not achieve state-of-the-art results, is that grounds for rejection?\\nA: No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge. Submissions can achieve this without achieving state-of-the-art results.\\nQ: Are authors expected to cite and compare with very recent work? What about non peer-reviewed (e.g., ArXiv) papers? (updated on 7 November 2022)\\nA: We consider papers contemporaneous if they are published (available in online proceedings) within the last four months. That means, since our full paper deadline is September 28, if a paper was published (i.e., at a peer-reviewed venue) on or after May 28, 2022, authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper. Authors are encouraged to cite and discuss all relevant papers, but they may be excused for not knowing about papers not published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals, which includes papers exclusively available on arXiv. Reviewers are encouraged to use their own good judgement and, if in doubt, discuss with their area chair.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Page Load\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        ICLR uses cookies for essential functions only.

serve as an ICLR 2023 reviewer. Your contribution as a reviewer is paramount to creating an exciting and high-quality program. We ask that:\\n\\nYour reviews are timely and substantive.\\nYou follow the reviewing guidelines below.\\xa0\\nYou adhere to our Code of Ethics in your role as a reviewer. You must also adhere to our Code of Conduct.\\n\\nThis guide is intended to help you understand the ICLR 2023 decision process and your role within it. It contains:\\n\\nAn outline of the main reviewer tasks\\nStep-by-step reviewing instructions (especially relevant for reviewers that are new to ICLR)\\nReview examples\\nAn FAQ.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe\u2019re counting on you\\nAs a reviewer you are central to the program creation process for ICLR 2023. Your Area Chairs (ACs), Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and the Program Chairs (PCs) will rely greatly on your expertise and your diligent and thorough reviews to make decisions on each paper. Therefore, your role as a reviewer is critical to ensuring a strong program for ICLR 2023.\\nHigh-quality reviews are also very valuable for helping authors improve their work, whether it is eventually accepted by ICLR 2023, or not. Therefore it is important to treat each valid ICLR 2023 submission with equal care.\\nAs a token of our appreciation for your essential work, top reviewers will be acknowledged permanently on the ICLR 2023 website. Furthermore, top and high quality reviewers will receive special acknowledgement during the opening ceremony and free registration to ICLR 2023.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMain reviewer tasks\\nThe main reviewer tasks and dates are as follows:\\n\\nCreate or update your OpenReview profile (September 30 2022)\\nBid on papers (September 30 2022 - October 06 2022)\\nWrite a constructive, thorough and timely review (October 12 2022 - October 24 2022)\\nInitial paper reviews released (November 4 2022)\\nDiscuss with authors and other reviewers to clarify and improve the paper (November 4 2022 - November 18 2022)\\nFlag any potential CoE violations and/or concerns (by November 18 2022)\\nProvide a recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (by November 18 2022)\\nVirtual Meeting with AC if paper you reviewed falls into borderline papers (November 18 2022 - December 12 2022)\\nProvide a final recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (after Virtual Meeting)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCode of Ethics\\nAll ICLR participants, including reviewers, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics). All reviewers are required to read the Code of Ethics and adhere to it. The Code of Ethics applies to all conference participation, including paper submission, reviewing, and paper discussion.\\xa0\\nAs part of the review process, reviewers are asked to raise potential violations of the ICLR Code of Ethics. Note that authors are encouraged to discuss questions and potential issues regarding the Code of Ethics as part of their submission. This discussion is not counted against the maximum page limit of the paper and should be included as a separate section.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReviewing a submission: step-by-step\\nSummarized in one sentence, a review aims to determine whether a submission will bring sufficient value to the community and contribute new knowledge. The process can be broken down into the following main reviewer tasks:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRead the paper: It\u2019s important to carefully read through the entire paper, and to look up any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself sufficient time for this step.\\nWhile reading, consider the following:\\n\\nObjective of the work: What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations as to potential value and impact.\\nStrong points: is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible, does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?\\nWeak points: is it weak in any of the aspects listed in b.?\\nBe mindful of potential biases and try to be open-minded about the value and interest a paper can hold for the entire ICLR community, even if it may not be very interesting for you.\\n\\n\\nAnswer four key questions for yourself, to make a recommendation to Accept or Reject:\\n\\nWhat is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?\\nIs the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\\nDoes the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\\nWhat is the significance of the work? Does it contribute new knowledge and sufficient value to the community? Note, this does not necessarily require state-of-the-art results. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge (incl., empirical, theoretical, for practitioners, etc).\\n\\n\\nWrite and submit your initial review, organizing it as follows:\\xa0\\n\\nSummarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.\\nList strong and weak points of the paper. Be as comprehensive as possible.\\nClearly state your initial recommendation (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\\nProvide supporting arguments for your recommendation.\\nAsk questions you would like answered by the authors to help you clarify your understanding of the paper and provide the additional evidence you need to be confident in your assessment.\\xa0\\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\\n\\n\\nComplete the CoE report: ICLR has adopted the following Code of Ethics (CoE). When submitting your review, you\u2019ll be asked to complete a CoE report for the paper. The report is a simple form with two questions. The first asks whether there is a potential violation of the CoE. The second is relevant only if there is a potential violation and asks the reviewer to explain why there may be a potential violation. In order to answer these questions, it is therefore important that you read the CoE before starting your reviews. \\n\\t\\xa0\\nEngage in discussion: The discussion phase at ICLR is different from most conferences in the AI/ML community. During this phase, reviewers, authors and area chairs engage in asynchronous discussion and authors are allowed to revise their submissions to address concerns that arise. It is crucial that you are actively engaged during this phase. Maintain a spirit of openness to changing your initial recommendation (either to a more positive or more negative) rating.\\nBorderline paper meeting: This year, we are introducing a new program for ACs to (virtually) meet and discuss with reviewers only for borderline cases. ACs will reach out to schedule this meeting. This is to ensure active discussions among reviewers, and well-thought-out decisions. ACs will schedule the meeting and facilitate the discussion. For a productive discussion, it is important to familiarize yourself with other reviewers\\' feedback prior to the meeting. Please note that we will be leveraging information for reviewers who failed to attend this meeting (excluding emergencies).\\xa0\\nProvide final recommendation: Update your review, taking into account the new information collected during the discussion phase, and any revisions to the submission. State your reasoning and what did/didn\u2019t change your recommendation throughout the discussion phase.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor great in-depth resources on reviewing, see these resources:\\n\\nDaniel Dennet, Criticising with Kindness.\\nComprehensive advice: Mistakes Reviewers Make\\nViews from multiple reviewers: Last minute reviewing advice\\nPerspective from instructions to Area Chairs: Dear ACs.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReview Examples\\nHere are two sample reviews from previous conferences that give an example of what we consider a good review for the case of leaning-to-accept and leaning-to-reject.\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Accept\\nThis paper proposes a method, Dual-AC, for optimizing the actor (policy) and critic (value function) simultaneously which takes the form of a zero-sum game resulting in a principled method for using the critic to optimize the actor. In order to achieve that, they take the linear programming approach of solving the Bellman optimality equations, outline the deficiencies of this approach, and propose solutions to mitigate those problems. The discussion on the deficiencies of the naive LP approach is mostly well done. Their main contribution is extending the single step LP formulation to a multi-step dual form that reduces the bias and makes the connection between policy and value function optimization much clearer without losing convexity by applying a regularization. They perform an empirical study in the Inverted Double Pendulum domain to conclude that their extended algorithm outperforms the naive linear programming approach without the improvements. Lastly, there are empirical experiments done to conclude the superior performance of Dual-AC in contrast to other actor-critic algorithms.\\xa0\\nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, with the caveat for some clarifications on the theory and experiments. Given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score.\\xa0\\nFor the theory, there are a few steps that need clarification and further clarification on novelty. For novelty, it is unclear if Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are both being stated as novel results. It looks like Theorem 2 has already been shown in \"Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision Problem in Nearly-Linear Running Time\u201d. There is a statement that \u201cChen & Wang (2016); Wang (2017) apply stochastic first-order algorithms (Nemirovski et al., 2009) for the one-step Lagrangian of the LP problem in reinforcement learning setting. However, as we discussed in Section 3, their algorithm is restricted to tabular parametrization\u201d. Is your Theorem 2 somehow an extension? Is Theorem 3 completely new?\\nThis is particularly called into question due to the lack of assumptions about the function class for value functions. It seems like the value function is required to be able to represent the true value function, which can be almost as restrictive as requiring tabular parameterizations (which can represent the true value function). This assumption seems to be used right at the bottom of Page 17, where U^{pi*} = V^*. Further, eta_v must be chosen to ensure that it does not affect (constrain) the optimal solution, which implies it might need to be very small. More about conditions on eta_v would be illuminating.\\xa0\\nThere is also one step in the theorem that I cannot verify. On Page 18, how is the squared removed for difference between U and Upi? The transition from the second line of the proof to the third line is not clear. It would also be good to more clearly state on page 14 how you get the first inequality, for || V^* ||_{2,mu}^2.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed.\\n1. It would have been better to also show the performance graphs with and without the improvements for multiple domains.\\n2. The central contribution is extending the single step LP to a multi-step formulation. It would be beneficial to empirically demonstrate how increasing k (the multi-step parameter) affects the performance gains.\\n3. Increasing k also comes at a computational cost. I would like to see some discussions on this and how long dual-AC takes to converge in comparison to the other algorithms tested (PPO and TRPO).\\n4. The authors concluded the presence of local convexity based on hessian inspection due to the use of path regularization. It was also mentioned that increasing the regularization parameter size increases the convergence rate. Empirically, how does changing the regularization parameter affect the performance in terms of reward maximization? In the experimental section of the appendix, it is mentioned that multiple regularization settings were tried but their performance is not mentioned. Also, for the regularization parameters that were tried, based on hessian inspection, did they all result in local convexity? A bit more discussion on these choices would be helpful.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMinor comments:\\n1.

The new approach is applied to both linear and non-linear function approximation, and for prediction and control problems. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments in classic benchmark control domains (Mountain Car and Acrobot), and in Pong.\\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or practice, (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve (nor differentiates it from the usual problem of generalizing well), (3) the experiments are difficult to understand, missing many details, and generally do not support a significant contribution, and (4) the paper is imprecise and unpolished.\\nMain argument\\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that the problem it is trying to solve is a real thing. There is no experiment in this paper that clearly shows how this temporal generalization problem is different from the need to generalize well with function approximation. The paper points to references to establish the existence of the problem, but for example the Durugkar and Stone paper is a workshop paper and the conference version of that paper was rejected from ICLR 2018 and the reviewers highlighted serious issues with the paper\u2014that is not work to build upon. Further the paper under review here claims this problem is most pressing in the non-linear case, but the analysis in section 4.1 is for the linear case.\\xa0\\nThe resultant algorithm does not seem well justified, and has a different fixed point than TD, but there is no discussion of this other than section 4.4, which does not make clear statements about the correctness of the algorithm or what it converges to. Can you provide a proof or any kind of evidence that the proposed approach is sound, or how it\u2019s fixed point relates to TD?\\nThe experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches. There are so many missing details it is difficult to draw many conclusions:\\n\\nWhat was the policy used in exp1 for policy evaluation in MC?\\nWhy Fourier basis features?\\nIn MC with DQN how did you adjust the parameters and architecture for the MC task?\\nWas the reward in MC and Acrobot -1 per step or something else\\nHow did you tune the parameters in the MC and Acrobot experiments?\\nWhy so few runs in MC, none of the results presented are significant?\\nWhy is the performance so bad in MC?\\nDid you evaluate online learning or do tests with the greedy policy?\\nHow did you initialize the value functions and weights?\\nWhy did you use experience replay for the linear experiments?\\nIN MC and Acrobot why only a one layer MLP?\\n\\nIgnoring all that, the results are not convincing. Most of the results in the paper are not statistically significant. The policy evaluation results in MC show little difference to regular TD. The Pong results show DQN is actually better. This makes the reader wonder if the result with DQN on MC and Acrobot are only worse because you did not properly tune DQN for those domains, whereas the default DQN architecture is well tuned for Atari and that is why you method is competitive in the smaller domains.\\xa0\\nThe differences in the \u201caverage change in value plots\u201d are very small if the rewards are -1 per step. Can you provide some context to understand the significance of this difference?

The review I just submitted is not appearing! Did it go thru?\\nA. There seems to be some delay in the system for you to see your reviews. Just give a bit of time and refresh again.\\n\\xa0\\nQ. What is the borderline paper meeting between AC and reviewers about?\\nA. This year we require ACs to meet with reviewers for all borderline papers (defined and announced by PCs once all reviews are received). There will be one meeting per borderline paper. Once we receive all reviews, we will let ACs know which papers fall into this bucket. ACs will then schedule and run the meetings with the reviewers of the papers in question.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: What if I can not attend the meeting?\\nA: Please work with your AC to find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. Note that the discussion phase is roughly 1 month long, and overlaps with the NeurIPS conference, in case in-person meeting is preferred. All reviewers agreed to participate in review meetings when they accepted the reviewer invitations. An AC has right to\\xa0 downweight the review of reviewers who refuse to attend the meeting.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: How should I use supplementary material?\\nA: It is not necessary to read supplementary material but such material can often answer questions that arise while reading the main paper, so consider looking there before asking authors.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: How should I handle a policy violation?\\nA: To flag a CoE violation related to a submission, please indicate it when submitting the CoE report for that paper. The AC will work with the PC and the ethics board to resolve the case. To discuss other violations (e.g. plagiarism, double submission, paper length, formatting, etc.), please contact either the AC/SAC or the PC as appropriate. You can do this by sending a confidential comment with the appropriate readership restrictions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: Am I allowed to ask for additional experiments?\\nA: You can ask for additional experiments. New experiments should not significantly change the content of the submission. Rather, they should be limited in scope and serve to more thoroughly validate existing results from the submission.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: If a submission does not achieve state-of-the-art results, is that grounds for rejection?\\nA: No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge. Submissions can achieve this without achieving state-of-the-art results.\\nQ: Are authors expected to cite and compare with very recent work? What about non peer-reviewed (e.g., ArXiv) papers? (updated on 7 November 2022)\\nA: We consider papers contemporaneous if they are published (available in online proceedings) within the last four months. That means, since our full paper deadline is September 28, if a paper was published (i.e., at a peer-reviewed venue) on or after May 28, 2022, authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper. Authors are encouraged to cite and discuss all relevant papers, but they may be excused for not knowing about papers not published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals, which includes papers exclusively available on arXiv. Reviewers are encouraged to use their own good judgement and, if in doubt, discuss with their area chair.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Page Load\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        ICLR uses cookies for essential functions only.

To the end, we propose IPM, an Information lossless Pretraining strategy for Molecular property prediction that leverages the information of both the original graph and line graph of molecules.

This pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned on smaller, labeled datasets for specific molecular property prediction tasks.\\n\\n### Validity of Experimental Results\\n\\nThe experimental setup appears generally valid and robust.\\n\\n*   **Benchmarks:** The paper uses a comprehensive set of standard molecular property prediction benchmarks, including QM9 (quantum mechanical properties), ESOL, Lipophilicity, FreeSolv (physicochemical properties), and Tox21, PCBA (biological activities/ADMET properties). This diverse set allows for a thorough evaluation across different types of tasks and dataset sizes.\\n*   **Metrics:** Standard evaluation metrics are employed (MAE/RMSE for regression, ROC-AUC/PR-AUC for classification), which are appropriate for the respective tasks.\\n*   **Baselines:** The paper typically compares against common baselines, including models trained from scratch (random initialization) and other self-supervised pre-training methods (e.g., various forms of masking and context prediction, if applicable).

QM9 is a relatively small dataset (around 130k molecules) and has been heavily benchmarked. Many sophisticated GNNs and pre-training methods have achieved near-saturation performance. While an improvement is positive, unless it's a substantial leap or achieved with very few labeled samples, it might not be a *major* contribution on its own. The value here is more in demonstrating the method's applicability and consistency.\\n*   **ESOL, Lipophilicity, FreeSolv:** These are also relatively small datasets, but represent important physicochemical properties.

While individual components might not be entirely groundbreaking in isolation, their synergistic combination, particularly the integration of a physically-inspired GNN architecture with a denoising task for molecular data, offers significant promise and warrants a positive consideration. The technical soundness hinges on the precise definition of noise and the denoising objective, and the empirical results are crucial to validate the architectural choice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Denoising Pre-training Approach: Novelty & Technical Soundness\\n\\n*   **Novelty:**\\n    *   **Conceptual:** Denoising as a pre-training strategy is not new. Denoising autoencoders have existed for decades. Masked language modeling (BERT) and masked image modeling (MAE) are forms of denoising/reconstruction. In GNNs, masked node/edge prediction, attribute reconstruction, and more recently, denoising diffusion models on graphs have been explored.\\n    *   **Application to Molecules with Specific Noise:** The novelty here lies in the *type* of noise introduced (e.g., perturbing atom types, bond types, or crucially, *atomic coordinates*) and the subsequent denoising task within the context of learning representations for molecular property prediction. If the paper introduces noise to atomic coordinates and requires the model to reconstruct the original, stable geometry, this is a particularly novel and challenging denoising task for molecular graphs, directly leveraging their spatial nature. If it's just masking atom/bond features, it's less novel but still valid.\\n    *   **Integration with GNS/GNS-TAT:** The combination of a denoising objective with a GNS-like architecture specifically designed for physical interactions adds a layer of novelty, suggesting that the pre-training might implicitly learn physically consistent representations.\\n\\n*   **Technical Soundness:**\\n    *   **Noise Generation:** The soundness largely depends on how noise is generated. Random noise (e.g., uniformly flipping features) might be less effective than structured or physically-motivated noise (e.g., adding Gaussian noise to coordinates, simulating bond breaking/formation, or masking based on connectivity).\\n    *   **Denoising Objective:** The objective function must be well-defined and align with the desired learned representation. For feature denoising, cross-entropy or MSE is standard. For coordinate denoising, an L2 loss on positions or a force-based loss could be relevant. A robust denoising task forces the model to learn about local structure, atomic relationships, and potentially even implicit energy landscapes, leading to more robust and chemically-aware embeddings.\\n    *   **Scalability:** Denoising can be computationally intensive, especially for large molecules or extensive datasets. The paper should demonstrate the scalability of the pre-training process.\\n\\n**Verdict:** While the *concept* of denoising is not new, its specific application to molecules, particularly if it involves *positional denoising* or other physically-inspired perturbations, within a GNS framework, offers sufficient novelty. The technical soundness relies on carefully designed noise and objective functions that encourage learning meaningful chemical representations.\\n\\n### 2. GNS/GNS-TAT Architecture Choice\\n\\n*   **Choice Justification:**\\n    *   **Initial Apparent Mismatch:** GNS (Graph Network Simulators) and GNS-TAT (Transformer Attention Transformer) are primarily designed for *physical simulations* and *predicting dynamics* (e.g., particle trajectories, fluid flow, material deformation) by learning implicit force fields. Molecular *property prediction* is typically a *static* task. Why use an architecture built for dynamics?\\n    *   **Potential Benefits for Static Tasks:** This is the key argument the paper needs to make. A GNS-like architecture can be interpreted as a powerful, iterative message-passing mechanism that *refines* representations over several \\\"simulation\\\" steps. For molecules, this iterative refinement can be highly beneficial:\\n        *   **Learning Local Interactions:** The core message-passing of GNS is excellent at propagating information about local interactions across the graph.\\n        *   **Implicit Energy/Force Fields:** By iteratively updating node states (or even positions in a denoising context), the GNS can implicitly learn about stable configurations, steric hindrance, and attractive/repulsive forces, which are critical for molecular properties.\\n        *   **Robustness to Perturbations:** Its iterative nature might make it more robust to noisy input, as it can \\\"settle\\\" into a more stable representation.\\n        *   **Spatial Awareness:** GNS inherently handles spatial coordinates, which is crucial for molecules.\\n    *   **TAT Component:** The Transformer Attention Transformer (TAT) enhances the GNS by integrating powerful attention mechanisms. This can improve the aggregation of information from neighbors and across different interaction types, leading to more expressive representations.\\n\\n*   **Technical Soundness:**\\n    *   **Complexity vs. Benefit:** GNS architectures can be more complex and computationally expensive than simpler GNNs (e.g., GCN, GAT, MPNNs). The paper must demonstrate that this added complexity translates to tangible performance benefits on downstream tasks, justifying the architectural choice.\\n    *   **Adaptation for Static Graphs:** If the GNS is used, are its \\\"simulation steps\\\" simply viewed as deeper message-passing layers, or is there a more nuanced interpretation (e.g., learning a relaxation process from noisy input)? The paper should clarify how the dynamic nature of GNS is leveraged or adapted for static inputs.\\n\\n**Verdict:** While an unconventional choice for static molecular property prediction, the GNS/GNS-TAT architecture can be technically sound and even advantageous if its iterative refinement and robust interaction modeling capabilities are properly leveraged. The paper should clearly articulate *why* this architecture is superior to standard, simpler GNNs for the *specific denoising task* and subsequent property prediction.\\n\\n### 3. Connection to Force Field Learning\\n\\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:**\\n    *   **Implicit Connection:** If the denoising task involves adding noise to atomic *coordinates* and requiring the model to predict the *original, stable coordinates* or *displacements* from the noisy ones, then the connection to force field learning is very strong and implicit. A force field aims to describe the energy and forces within a system based on atomic positions. By learning to \\\"correct\\\" perturbed positions, the model essentially learns the underlying forces that drive atoms back to their equilibrium positions. This would lead to representations that intrinsically encode physical stability and interactions.\\n    *   **Explicit Discussion:** The paper should explicitly draw this connection, highlighting how the denoising objective encourages the model to learn a \\\"force-field-aware\\\" latent space. This could be a major selling point.\\n\\n*   **Significance:**\\n    *   **Physically Informed Representations:** Learning representations that implicitly understand inter-atomic forces and molecular geometry is highly desirable for molecular tasks. Such representations are likely to be more robust, generalize better to new molecules, and capture crucial chemical information.\\n    *   **Foundation for Further Work:** If successful, this approach could bridge the gap between ML models and physical simulation, opening avenues for new inverse design tasks, stable conformation prediction, or even more accurate force field development.\\n\\n**Verdict:** This is potentially the most significant aspect of the paper. If the denoising involves coordinate manipulation, the model is essentially learning an implicit force field. This provides a strong, physically-motivated basis for the learned representations, making the approach highly sound and impactful. The paper should clearly elaborate on this connection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Justification for Weighted Assessment (Weak Accept / Borderline Accept)\\n\\nThe paper proposes an interesting and potentially impactful direction by combining self-supervised denoising with a physically-motivated GNN architecture (GNS/GNS-TAT) for molecular property prediction.\\n\\n*   **Strengths (leading to Accept):**\\n    *   **Synergistic Combination:** The core strength lies in the *combination* of denoising pre-training with a GNS-like architecture, especially if coordinate denoising is involved. This is a powerful idea for learning physically-aware representations of molecules.\\n    *   **Potential for Robust Representations:** Learning to recover original molecular states from noisy inputs (especially spatial ones) is likely to lead to highly robust and chemically meaningful representations, which is a major goal in molecular machine learning.\\n    *   **Promising Research Direction:** Bridging the gap between GNNs for static graph tasks and architectures designed for physical simulation is a valuable avenue.\\n    *   **Connection to Force Fields:** The implicit learning of force-field-like knowledge through coordinate denoising is a strong theoretical and practical advantage.\\n\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Clarification (leading to Borderline):**\\n    *   **True Novelty of Denoising:** While the *application* is novel, the *concept* of denoising pre-training itself is well-established. The paper must precisely define its unique contribution in the denoising *methodology* (type of noise, objective function) to justify its novelty claims.\\n    *   **Justification for GNS/GNS-TAT Complexity:** The paper *must convincingly demonstrate* why the GNS/GNS-TAT architecture is superior to simpler, less computationally intensive GNNs for this specific task. Ablation studies comparing GNS to standard MPNNs for the denoising task and downstream performance are essential. Is the iterative refinement truly beneficial, or is it an overkill for static graphs?\\n    *   **Empirical Performance:** The ultimate validation rests on strong empirical results against state-of-the-art baselines on diverse molecular property prediction benchmarks. If the performance gains are marginal for the increased complexity, the justification weakens.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This paper presents a promising approach with a strong conceptual foundation, particularly if it leverages coordinate denoising and the GNS's ability to model physical interactions. While the individual components are not entirely novel, their synergistic combination for molecular representation learning is. The final assessment depends heavily on the detailed technical implementation of the denoising task and the empirical evidence supporting the architectural choice. Given its potential impact and novel integration of concepts, it leans towards **Weak Accept / Borderline Accept**, provided the technical details and experimental validation are robust.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.214931\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"GNNSpecialist\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper 'Pre-training via Denoising for Molecular Property Prediction' for ICLR 2023.

Were they re-implemented from scratch using the paper's code infrastructure? Or were results taken directly from published papers? If re-implemented, were their hyperparameters tuned rigorously on the same splits? If results are from papers, were the experimental conditions (e.g., data splits, number of models, seeds) perfectly matched? A table in the appendix detailing the specific hyperparameter settings and data splits used for *each* baseline would significantly enhance trust.\\n    *   **Computational Resources:** No explicit mention of the computational resources (GPU type, number of GPUs, CPU, RAM) used for pre-training and fine-tuning. This information is vital for other researchers to estimate the feasibility and cost of reproducing the work. Training times for different stages would also be highly beneficial.\\n\\n**2. Hyperparameter Tuning:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   The paper states that hyperparameters for both pre-training and fine-tuning were tuned.\\n    *   For pre-training, it mentions tuning learning rate, batch size, and architectural parameters. For fine-tuning, it mentions tuning learning rate, weight decay, and the number of epochs.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Lack of Detail:** This is a major area for improvement. The paper lacks specific details about the hyperparameter tuning process:\\n        *   **Search Space:** What were the ranges for each hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate from $1e-5$ to $1e-3$)?\\n        *   **Search Strategy:** Was it a grid search, random search, or something more sophisticated?\\n        *   **Number of Trials:** How many different configurations were explored for pre-training and fine-tuning, respectively?\\n        *   **Validation Metric:** Which metric was used for selecting the best hyperparameters (e.g., validation RMSE, ROC-AUC)?\\n        *   **Specific Best Values:** A table, ideally in the appendix, listing the *exact* hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, embedding dimension, number of layers, dropout, etc.) for the best-performing models on each dataset would be invaluable. This is critical for exact reproduction.\\n    *   **Sensitivity Analysis (Optional but helpful):** While not strictly required, a discussion or small plot showing the sensitivity of performance to key hyperparameters (e.g., pre-training learning rate, masking ratio) would demonstrate robustness and understanding of the model.\\n\\n**3. Dataset Usage:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Standard Datasets:** Uses ZINC-250K for pre-training and standard MoleculeNet datasets for downstream tasks, which are publicly available and widely accepted.\\n    *   **Clear Splits:** The paper clearly states the use of standard 8:1:1 train/validation/test splits and employs both random and scaffold splits, which is crucial for molecular generalization assessment.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Data Preprocessing Details:** While likely standard, explicitly mentioning any specific preprocessing steps (e.g., sanitization, removal of duplicates, specific featurization method used before input to the GNN) would ensure full transparency.\\n    *   **Dataset Versions/Checksums (Minor):** For absolute rigor, specifying the exact version or checksum of the datasets used can prevent future discrepancies if datasets are updated.\\n\\n**4. Reproducibility Statement & Practical Reproducibility:**\\n*   **Strengths (Assuming an ICLR-compliant submission):**\\n    *   An ICLR submission *requires* a reproducibility statement. A good statement typically outlines random seeds, hardware, software environment, and links to code.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Code Availability:** The most critical aspect. For an ICLR paper, the code *must* be publicly available (e.g., GitHub repository) upon acceptance. The paper should explicitly state its availability and provide a link.\\n    *   **Code Quality and Documentation:** Beyond availability, the code needs to be well-structured, commented, and easy to run. A `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file is essential. Clear `README.md` instructions on how to set up the environment, download data, pre-train the model, fine-tune, and evaluate on all reported benchmarks are paramount.\\n    *   **Random Seeds:** The paper should explicitly state that fixed random seeds were used for all experiments and specify these seeds. This is fundamental for reproducibility.\\n    *   **Matching Reported Results:** The code, when run, should ideally produce results that are very close to (within reasonable variance) the reported numbers in the paper.

Denoising Pre-training Approach: Novelty & Technical Soundness\\n\\n*   **Novelty:**\\n    *   **Conceptual:** Denoising as a pre-training strategy is not new. Denoising autoencoders have existed for decades. Masked language modeling (BERT) and masked image modeling (MAE) are forms of denoising/reconstruction. In GNNs, masked node/edge prediction, attribute reconstruction, and more recently, denoising diffusion models on graphs have been explored.\\n    *   **Application to Molecules with Specific Noise:** The novelty here lies in the *type* of noise introduced (e.g., perturbing atom types, bond types, or crucially, *atomic coordinates*) and the subsequent denoising task within the context of learning representations for molecular property prediction. If the paper introduces noise to atomic coordinates and requires the model to reconstruct the original, stable geometry, this is a particularly novel and challenging denoising task for molecular graphs, directly leveraging their spatial nature. If it\\'s just masking atom/bond features, it\\'s less novel but still valid.\\n    *   **Integration with GNS/GNS-TAT:** The combination of a denoising objective with a GNS-like architecture specifically designed for physical interactions adds a layer of novelty, suggesting that the pre-training might implicitly learn physically consistent representations.\\n\\n*   **Technical Soundness:**\\n    *   **Noise Generation:** The soundness largely depends on how noise is generated. Random noise (e.g., uniformly flipping features) might be less effective than structured or physically-motivated noise (e.g., adding Gaussian noise to coordinates, simulating bond breaking/formation, or masking based on connectivity).\\n    *   **Denoising Objective:** The objective function must be well-defined and align with the desired learned representation. For feature denoising, cross-entropy or MSE is standard. For coordinate denoising, an L2 loss on positions or a force-based loss could be relevant. A robust denoising task forces the model to learn about local structure, atomic relationships, and potentially even implicit energy landscapes, leading to more robust and chemically-aware embeddings.\\n    *   **Scalability:** Denoising can be computationally intensive, especially for large molecules or extensive datasets. The paper should demonstrate the scalability of the pre-training process.\\n\\n**Verdict:** While the *concept* of denoising is not new, its specific application to molecules, particularly if it involves *positional denoising* or other physically-inspired perturbations, within a GNS framework, offers sufficient novelty. The technical soundness relies on carefully designed noise and objective functions that encourage learning meaningful chemical representations.\\n\\n### 2. GNS/GNS-TAT Architecture Choice\\n\\n*   **Choice Justification:**\\n    *   **Initial Apparent Mismatch:** GNS (Graph Network Simulators) and GNS-TAT (Transformer Attention Transformer) are primarily designed for *physical simulations* and *predicting dynamics* (e.g., particle trajectories, fluid flow, material deformation) by learning implicit force fields. Molecular *property prediction* is typically a *static* task. Why use an architecture built for dynamics?\\n    *   **Potential Benefits for Static Tasks:** This is the key argument the paper needs to make. A GNS-like architecture can be interpreted as a powerful, iterative message-passing mechanism that *refines* representations over several \"simulation\" steps. For molecules, this iterative refinement can be highly beneficial:\\n        *   **Learning Local Interactions:** The core message-passing of GNS is excellent at propagating information about local interactions across the graph.\\n        *   **Implicit Energy/Force Fields:** By iteratively updating node states (or even positions in a denoising context), the GNS can implicitly learn about stable configurations, steric hindrance, and attractive/repulsive forces, which are critical for molecular properties.\\n        *   **Robustness to Perturbations:** Its iterative nature might make it more robust to noisy input, as it can \"settle\" into a more stable representation.\\n        *   **Spatial Awareness:** GNS inherently handles spatial coordinates, which is crucial for molecules.\\n    *   **TAT Component:** The Transformer Attention Transformer (TAT) enhances the GNS by integrating powerful attention mechanisms. This can improve the aggregation of information from neighbors and across different interaction types, leading to more expressive representations.\\n\\n*   **Technical Soundness:**\\n    *   **Complexity vs. Benefit:** GNS architectures can be more complex and computationally expensive than simpler GNNs (e.g., GCN, GAT, MPNNs). The paper must demonstrate that this added complexity translates to tangible performance benefits on downstream tasks, justifying the architectural choice.\\n    *   **Adaptation for Static Graphs:** If the GNS is used, are its \"simulation steps\" simply viewed as deeper message-passing layers, or is there a more nuanced interpretation (e.g., learning a relaxation process from noisy input)? The paper should clarify how the dynamic nature of GNS is leveraged or adapted for static inputs.\\n\\n**Verdict:** While an unconventional choice for static molecular property prediction, the GNS/GNS-TAT architecture can be technically sound and even advantageous if its iterative refinement and robust interaction modeling capabilities are properly leveraged. The paper should clearly articulate *why* this architecture is superior to standard, simpler GNNs for the *specific denoising task* and subsequent property prediction.\\n\\n### 3. Connection to Force Field Learning\\n\\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:**\\n    *   **Implicit Connection:** If the denoising task involves adding noise to atomic *coordinates* and requiring the model to predict the *original, stable coordinates* or *displacements* from the noisy ones, then the connection to force field learning is very strong and implicit. A force field aims to describe the energy and forces within a system based on atomic positions. By learning to \"correct\" perturbed positions, the model essentially learns the underlying forces that drive atoms back to their equilibrium positions. This would lead to representations that intrinsically encode physical stability and interactions.\\n    *   **Explicit Discussion:** The paper should explicitly draw this connection, highlighting how the denoising objective encourages the model to learn a \"force-field-aware\" latent space. This could be a major selling point.\\n\\n*   **Significance:**\\n    *   **Physically Informed Representations:** Learning representations that implicitly understand inter-atomic forces and molecular geometry is highly desirable for molecular tasks. Such representations are likely to be more robust, generalize better to new molecules, and capture crucial chemical information.\\n    *   **Foundation for Further Work:** If successful, this approach could bridge the gap between ML models and physical simulation, opening avenues for new inverse design tasks, stable conformation prediction, or even more accurate force field development.\\n\\n**Verdict:** This is potentially the most significant aspect of the paper. If the denoising involves coordinate manipulation, the model is essentially learning an implicit force field. This provides a strong, physically-motivated basis for the learned representations, making the approach highly sound and impactful. The paper should clearly elaborate on this connection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Justification for Weighted Assessment (Weak Accept / Borderline Accept)\\n\\nThe paper proposes an interesting and potentially impactful direction by combining self-supervised denoising with a physically-motivated GNN architecture (GNS/GNS-TAT) for molecular property prediction.\\n\\n*   **Strengths (leading to Accept):**\\n    *   **Synergistic Combination:** The core strength lies in the *combination* of denoising pre-training with a GNS-like architecture, especially if coordinate denoising is involved. This is a powerful idea for learning physically-aware representations of molecules.\\n    *   **Potential for Robust Representations:** Learning to recover original molecular states from noisy inputs (especially spatial ones) is likely to lead to highly robust and chemically meaningful representations, which is a major goal in molecular machine learning.\\n    *   **Promising Research Direction:** Bridging the gap between GNNs for static graph tasks and architectures designed for physical simulation is a valuable avenue.\\n    *   **Connection to Force Fields:** The implicit learning of force-field-like knowledge through coordinate denoising is a strong theoretical and practical advantage.\\n\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Clarification (leading to Borderline):**\\n    *   **True Novelty of Denoising:** While the *application* is novel, the *concept* of denoising pre-training itself is well-established. The paper must precisely define its unique contribution in the denoising *methodology* (type of noise, objective function) to justify its novelty claims.\\n    *   **Justification for GNS/GNS-TAT Complexity:** The paper *must convincingly demonstrate* why the GNS/GNS-TAT architecture is superior to simpler, less computationally intensive GNNs for this specific task. Ablation studies comparing GNS to standard MPNNs for the denoising task and downstream performance are essential. Is the iterative refinement truly beneficial, or is it an overkill for static graphs?\\n    *   **Empirical Performance:** The ultimate validation rests on strong empirical results against state-of-the-art baselines on diverse molecular property prediction benchmarks. If the performance gains are marginal for the increased complexity, the justification weakens.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This paper presents a promising approach with a strong conceptual foundation, particularly if it leverages coordinate denoising and the GNS\\'s ability to model physical interactions. While the individual components are not entirely novel, their synergistic combination for molecular representation learning is. The final assessment depends heavily on the detailed technical implementation of the denoising task and the empirical evidence supporting the architectural choice. Given its potential impact and novel integration of concepts, it leans towards **Weak Accept / Borderline Accept**, provided the technical details and experimental validation are robust.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.214931}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': \"This review assesses the paper 'Pre-training via Denoising for Molecular Property Prediction' for ICLR 2023, focusing on reproducibility and benchmarking aspects.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment: Accept (Minor Revision)**\\n\\nThe paper proposes a novel and effective pre-training strategy for molecular property prediction, demonstrating strong empirical results across various MoleculeNet benchmarks. The core idea of denoising molecular graphs is sound and aligns with successful pre-training paradigms in other domains. However, for an ICLR paper, there are critical areas concerning reproducibility and detailed experimental setup that need stronger articulation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\n**1. Experimental Setup:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Clear Problem Definition:** The paper clearly defines the task (molecular property prediction) and the benefits of pre-training.\\n    *   **Standard Benchmarks:** The use of well-established MoleculeNet datasets (regression and classification tasks) is excellent, allowing for direct comparison with prior work.\\n    *   **Appropriate Metrics:** Standard metrics (RMSE for regression, ROC-AUC and PR-AUC for classification) are used correctly.\\n    *   **Strong Baselines:** The paper compares against relevant and strong baselines, including Graph-based (GIN, DMPNN), Language Model-based (ChemBERTa-2), and other advanced methods (Uni-Mol). This breadth strengthens the empirical evaluation.\\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** The paper includes valuable ablation studies on different masking strategies (atom, bond, feature masking) and the impact of pre-training data size, which helps understand the contribution of each component.\\n    *   **Fair Data Splits:** The usage of both random and scaffold splits is appropriate for molecular tasks, addressing the challenge of distribution shifts.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Baseline Implementation Details:** While strong baselines are chosen, it's crucial to clarify *how* these baselines were run. Were they re-implemented from scratch using the paper's code infrastructure? Or were results taken directly from published papers? If re-implemented, were their hyperparameters tuned rigorously on the same splits? If results are from papers, were the experimental conditions (e.g., data splits, number of models, seeds) perfectly matched? A table in the appendix detailing the specific hyperparameter settings and data splits used for *each* baseline would significantly enhance trust.\\n    *   **Computational Resources:** No explicit mention of the computational resources (GPU type, number of GPUs, CPU, RAM) used for pre-training and fine-tuning. This information is vital for other researchers to estimate the feasibility and cost of reproducing the work. Training times for different stages would also be highly beneficial.\\n\\n**2. Hyperparameter Tuning:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   The paper states that hyperparameters for both pre-training and fine-tuning were tuned.\\n    *   For pre-training, it mentions tuning learning rate, batch size, and architectural parameters. For fine-tuning, it mentions tuning learning rate, weight decay, and the number of epochs.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Lack of Detail:** This is a major area for improvement. The paper lacks specific details about the hyperparameter tuning process:\\n        *   **Search Space:** What were the ranges for each hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate from $1e-5$ to $1e-3$)?\\n        *   **Search Strategy:** Was it a grid search, random search, or something more sophisticated?\\n        *   **Number of Trials:** How many different configurations were explored for pre-training and fine-tuning, respectively?\\n        *   **Validation Metric:** Which metric was used for selecting the best hyperparameters (e.g., validation RMSE, ROC-AUC)?\\n        *   **Specific Best Values:** A table, ideally in the appendix, listing the *exact* hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, embedding dimension, number of layers, dropout, etc.) for the best-performing models on each dataset would be invaluable. This is critical for exact reproduction.\\n    *   **Sensitivity Analysis (Optional but helpful):** While not strictly required, a discussion or small plot showing the sensitivity of performance to key hyperparameters (e.g., pre-training learning rate, masking ratio) would demonstrate robustness and understanding of the model.\\n\\n**3. Dataset Usage:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Standard Datasets:** Uses ZINC-250K for pre-training and standard MoleculeNet datasets for downstream tasks, which are publicly available and widely accepted.\\n    *   **Clear Splits:** The paper clearly states the use of standard 8:1:1 train/validation/test splits and employs both random and scaffold splits, which is crucial for molecular generalization assessment.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Data Preprocessing Details:** While likely standard, explicitly mentioning any specific preprocessing steps (e.g., sanitization, removal of duplicates, specific featurization method used before input to the GNN) would ensure full transparency.\\n    *   **Dataset Versions/Checksums (Minor):** For absolute rigor, specifying the exact version or checksum of the datasets used can prevent future discrepancies if datasets are updated.\\n\\n**4. Reproducibility Statement & Practical Reproducibility:**\\n*   **Strengths (Assuming an ICLR-compliant submission):**\\n    *   An ICLR submission *requires* a reproducibility statement. A good statement typically outlines random seeds, hardware, software environment, and links to code.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Code Availability:** The most critical aspect. For an ICLR paper, the code *must* be publicly available (e.g., GitHub repository) upon acceptance. The paper should explicitly state its availability and provide a link.\\n    *   **Code Quality and Documentation:** Beyond availability, the code needs to be well-structured, commented, and easy to run. A `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file is essential. Clear `README.md` instructions on how to set up the environment, download data, pre-train the model, fine-tune, and evaluate on all reported benchmarks are paramount.\\n    *   **Random Seeds:** The paper should explicitly state that fixed random seeds were used for all experiments and specify these seeds. This is fundamental for reproducibility.\\n    *   **Matching Reported Results:** The code, when run, should ideally produce results that are very close to (within reasonable variance) the reported numbers in the paper. The statement should implicitly promise this.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe paper presents a valuable contribution to pre-training methods for molecular property prediction. The empirical results are compelling, and the ablation studies provide good insights. However, the paper falls short on the rigorous details expected for a top-tier ML conference like ICLR regarding *how* the experiments were conducted and how they can be fully reproduced. The lack of specific hyperparameter values used, detailed search strategies, and explicit computational resource information hinders complete reproducibility.\\n\\n**Recommendation for Minor Revision:**\\nThe authors should address the following:\\n1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Details:** Provide a comprehensive table in the appendix with the exact hyperparameter values for the best-performing models on each dataset and elaborate on the search space and strategy used.\\n2.  **Computational Details:** Specify the hardware used for pre-training and fine-tuning, along with approximate training times.\\n3.  **Code Access & Documentation:** Ensure the code is publicly available, well-documented, and includes clear instructions for reproduction, including fixed random seeds. Clarify how baselines were run for fair comparison.\\n\\nWith these revisions, the paper would meet the high standards for reproducibility at ICLR and significantly increase its impact and utility for the research community.\", 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.2142896}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have received the evaluations from the three reviewer agents.
