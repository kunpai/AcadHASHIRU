The paper title is: Efficient Exploration via Fragmentation and Recall\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Human episodic memory breaks our continuous experience of the world into episodes or fragments that are divided by event boundaries that involve large changes of place, context, affordances, and perceptual inputs (Baldassano et al., 2017; Ezzyat & Davachi, 2011; Newtson & Engquist, 1976; Richmond & Zacks, 2017; Swallow et al., 2009; Zacks & Swallow, 2007). The episodic nature of memory is a core component of how we construct models of the world. It has been conjectured that episodic memory makes it easier to perform memory search, and to use the retrieved memories in chunks that are relevant for the current context. Humans also continue to learn and memorize new information throughout their lives, without needing to reconfigure all previously stored memories. These observations suggest a certain locality or fragmented nature to how we model the world. Chunking of experience has been shown to play a key role in perception, learning and cognition in humans and animals (De Groot, 1946; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Gobet et al., 2001; Gobet & Simon, 1998; Simon, 1974). In the hippocampus, place cells appear to chunk spatial information by defining separate maps when there has been a sufficiently large change in context or in other non-spatial or spatial variables, through a process called remapping; see Colgin et al. (2008); Fyhn et al. (2007). Grid and place cells in the hippocampal formation have also been shown to fragment their representations when the external world or their own behaviors have changed only gradually rather than discontinuously (Derdikman et al., 2009; Low et al., 2021). Recently, Klukas et al. (2021) proposed how such remapping could occur in even during continuous navigation through a continuous environment, modeling the process as one of online clustering based on observational surprisal. Similarly, when fitting complicated manifolds or functions, it is common to build a set of simpler local models of the manifold or function. Inspired by these ideas, here we propose building models for complicated spaces by fitting a sequence of local models, and using local models obtained through an online process of fragmentation to aid in the the exploratory process of moving through a large space and building a model of the space. Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 CONCEPT FIGURE We propose a new framework for exploration based on a concept of online Fragmentation-and-Recall, schematized in Figure 1. This model combines two ideas: 1) when faced with a complex world, it can be more efficient to build and combine multiple (and implicitly simpler) local models than to build a single global (and implicitly complex) model, and 2) boundaries between local models should occur when a local model ceases to be predictive. In what follows, as an agent explores, it predicts its next observation. Based on a measure of surprisal between its observation and prediction, there can be a fragmentation event, at which point the agent writes the current model into long-term memory (LTM) and initiates a new local model. While exploring the space, the agent consults its LTM, and recalls an existing model if it matches its observations. For the spatial domain, this is very similar to Klukas et al. (2021). The agent uses its current local model to act locally, and its LTM to act more globally. We apply this concept to solve spatial exploration and more general reinforcement learning exploration problems, and call the corresponding approaches FarMap and FarCuriosity, respectively. We evaluate the proposed framework on procedurally-generated spatial environments and reinforcement learning benchmarks. Experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed framework; FarMap explores the spatial environment with much less memory usage and is faster than its baselines (Yamauchi, 1997) by large margins, and FarCuriosity achieves better performance than the baseline fragmentation-less curiosity module (Burda et al., 2019) on standard heterogeneous Atari game benchmarks 1. The contribution of this paper is three-fold as follows: \u2022 We propose a new framework for exploration based on Fragmentation-and-Recall that divides the exploration space into multiple fragments and recalls previously explored ones. \u2022 We implemented our framework in spatial exploration tasks, referring to it as FarMap with short and long-term memory. Our experiments showed that FarMap reduces online memory size and wall-clock time relative to baselines. \u2022 We implemented our framework in a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning exploration setting, referring to it as FarCuriosity. FarCuriosity avoids catastrophic forgetting and achieves better performance compared to the baseline in heterogenous environments. 2 RELATED WORK: Frontier-based spatial exploration in SLAM SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) agents must efficiently explore spaces to build maps. A standard approach to exploration in SLAM is to define the frontier between observed and unobserved regions of a 2d environment, and then select exploratory goal locations from the set of frontier states (Yamauchi, 1997). Frontier-based exploration has been extended to 3d environments (Dai et al., 2020; Dornhege & Kleiner, 2011) and used as a building block of more sophisticated exploration strategies (Stachniss et al., 2004). Although conceptually simple, frontier-based exploration can be quite effective compared to more sophisticated decision-theoretic exploration (Holz et al., 2010). A cost of frontier-based exploration is 1Heterogeneous environments have diverse states that require the larger model capacity to memorize visited states for generating intrinsic reward. Please refer to Section F for the examples of heterogeneous environments. the use of global maps and global frontiers, which makes the process memory-expensive and search intensive. In contrast to frontier-based exploration, our approach learns the surprising parts of an environment as intrinsic subgoals, selecting among those as the exploratory goals. Submap-Based SLAM Submap-Based SLAM algorithms involve mapping a space by breaking it into local submaps that are connected to one another via a topological graph. Such Submap-Based SLAM methods are usually designed to avoid the problems of accruing path integration errors when building maps of large spaces (e.g. SegSLAM) (Fairfield et al., 2010) and to reduce the computational cost of planning paths between a start and target position (Maffei et al., 2013; Fairfield et al., 2010; Klukas et al., 2021). Segmented DP-SLAM (Maffei et al., 2013) adds DP-SLAM (Eliazar & Parr, 2003) to SegSLAM for reducing the search space, generating segments periodically at fixed timeintervals. Topological SLAM (Choset & Nagatani, 2001) generates new landmarks in an environment to build a topological graph of the landmarks, and navigates based on the graph. Our Fragmentation and Recall method, in particular FarMap, is closely related to these methods in that we build multiple submaps. However, FarMap divides space based on properties of the space (how predictable the space is based on the local map or model), and does so in an online manner using surprisal. Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning Motivated by the insufficiency of rewards alone to guide exploration in sparsely rewarded RL environments, several works construct intrinsic rewards encouraging agents to explore unfamiliar parts of an environment. Count-based methods provide intrinsic rewards for reaching infrequently visited states. These methods have strong theoretical guarantees for multi-arm bandits (Auer, 2003), and can be effective for reinforcement learning (Bellemare et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Ecoffet et al., 2021). Prediction-based methods estimate where the agent cannot predict some aspect of the environment, and provide intrinsic rewards for visiting those states (Burda et al., 2019; Choshen et al., 2018; Houthooft et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2017; Raileanu & Rockt\u00e4schel, 2020). Pathak et al. (2017), for instance, learns a forward model to predict the next state given the current state-action pair, and provides rewards scaling with the state\u2019s prediction error. Memory-Based Reinforcement Learning Memory-based reinforcement learning aims to solve the long-term credit assignment problem. Hung et al. (2019) combine LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with external memory along with an encoder and decoder for the memory. Lampinen et al. (2021) use a hierarchical LTM with chunks and attention for long-term recall inspired by Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017); however, their chunks are formed periodically rather than based on content and are not used as intrinsic options for exploration. Memory is also used for improving exploration: Go Explore (Ecoffet et al., 2021) remembers promising states so that it can directly visit those states, where the definition of promising can include rewarded states and frontiers. Similar to our proposal, we may view promising states in GoExplore as intrinsic options; however, if the promising states are frontiers, GoExplore becomes similar to frontier-based SLAM methods without fragmentation. Savinov et al. (2019) memorizes visited states for calculating reachability to penalize to an action that leads to reachable future states. While earlier memory-based exploration methods use memory as a guide for evaluating the intrinsic reward of a state, we augment existing exploration methods with memory, in combination with map or model fragmentation, to more efficiently explore. 3 FRAGMENTATION AND RECALL FRAMEWORK: The proposed framework is based on the notion of fragmentation and recall: While exploring an environment, an agent builds a local model and uses the local model in short-term memory (STM) to compute a surprisal signal that depends on the current observation and the agent\u2019s local model-based prediction. The surprisal can be any uncertainty estimate such as negative confidence or future prediction error. When the surprisal exceeds some threshold, this corresponds to a fragmentation event. At a fragmentation event, the local model is written to long-term-memory (LTM) building a connectivity graph that relates model fragments to each other so that it can provide information across the current local model without direct access to the stored models in LTM. The current (abstracted) observation (fracture point) is also stored, and the agent initializes an entirely new local model. On the other hand, if the current observation is sufficiently similar to a stored fracture point in LTM, the agent recalls the corresponding model fragment (local model). Hence, the agent can preserve and reuse previously acquired information. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe two application domains; spatial exploration and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning, respectively. Agent FragSLAM (submitted) 3.1 FRAGMENTATION AND RECALL IN SPATIAL EXPLORATION (FARMAP): SLAM algorithms explore space efficiently by aiming to explore frontier regions, the border between explored and unexplored space. Typically frontier-based exploration involves frequent consultation of a global map of frontier regions. The memory and search cost of finding subgoals grows rapidly with environment size; for agents exploring a very large space, the computational costs could explode. Here, we propose a fragmentation-and-recall based exploration strategy for spatial exploration (FarMap). In FarMap, each local model is a spatially local map built in short-term memory (STM). As Figure 2 shows, given the observation and the previous action, the FarMap agent updates the current local map. The agent decides its next subgoal, selecting a point within the current local map or a fracture point with a different local map, based on the relative surprisal of the different locations and the connectivity graph of maps in LTM (described below). Given sufficiently high surprisal at the current location, a fragmentation will occur. Upon fragmentation, the local map in STM is stored as an episode in LTM and then erased from STM. The STM begins a new local map. Stored local maps in LTM are recalled whenever the agent reaches a location a where fragmentation event had occurred. Section A and Algorithm 1 provide detailed procedures. Local Map The STM has a local predictive spatial map, Mcurt \u2208 R(C+1)\u00d7H\u00d7W where the size (H,W ) grows as the agent extends its observations in the local region. The first C channels of Mcurt denote color (e.g., RGB, grayscale) and the last channel denotes the agent\u2019s confidence in each spatial cell. For simplicity, in this paper, we will focus only on the update of confidence channel (C-th channel). The local predictive map is simply a temporally decaying trace of recent sensory observations, shifted by the agent\u2019s actions (movement through space) (Klukas et al., 2021): Mcurt,C = \u03b3 \u00b7Mcurt\u22121,C + (1\u2212 \u03b3) \u00b7 o\u2032t,C , (1) where \u03b3 is the decaying factor and ot \u2208 R(C+1)\u00d7h\u00d7w is the egocentric view input observation in the environment at time t sized as (h,w). The last channel of the observation means visibility; visible (1) or invisible (0) on each cell. o\u2032t \u2208 R(C+1)\u00d7H\u00d7W denotes a spatially transformed observation to Mcurt\u22121 to update the current observation to the local map in the correct position; rotation and zero-padding (Figure 2). Surprisal The scalar surprisal signal st = 1\u2212 ct is generated using the local map in STM and the current observation, where ct quantifies the average similarity of the visible part of observation to the local predictive map Mcurt\u22121 before update: ct = Mcurt\u22121,C \u00b7 o\u2032t,C ||o\u2032t,C ||1 . (2) The agent is assumed to maintain a running estimate of the mean \u00b5t and standard deviation \u03c3t of past surprisals, stored as part of the current map. Fragmentation Fragmentation occurs if the z-scored current surprisal ((st \u2212 \u00b5t)/\u03c3t) exceeds a threshold, \u03c1. Initially on each new map, the agent collects surprisal statistics and is not permitted to further fragment space until the number of samples is greater than 25. We also store the ratio qc of the number of frontier cells to the number of known cells and the distance between each fracture point in Mcurt . qc keeps updating every time step until it is stored in LTM. The ratio is used to guide agents on whether or not to move to other local maps. Recall Each local map records the fracture points. At these points, there are overlaps with other map fragments. When the agent moves to the point in the current local map, corresponding local map is recalled from LTM and the current one is stored in LTM. Subgoal Subgoal is decided by using either the current local map in STM or connectivity graph in LTM. The former enlarges the current local map while the latter helps find the next local map to explore. An agent explores the local region in the environment unless the current surprisal is too low (e.g., z-score is smaller than \u22121) and there is less explored local map nearby. Subgoals made with the current local map are based on frontier-based subgoals (Yamauchi, 1997) for exploring the local region. In the current local map, we first find the all frontiers which are unknown cells adjacent to the known unoccupied cells. A group of consecutive frontiers are called \u2018frontier-edge\u2019 and the original frontier-based exploration method uses the nearest centroid of the frontier-edge as a subgoal. Unlike standard SLAM methods that employ the entire map, our map in STM only covers a subregion of the environment. After fragmentation, the backward direction has several frontiers (border of two local models) forming a frontier-edge. It leads the agent to go back to the previous area and recall the corresponding map fragment. This would lead to the agent moving between two map fragments for a long time. Hence, we prioritize the frontier-edge that is not located in the backward direction. We also stochastically select the subgoal based on the number of frontiers in each cluster (frontier-edge) over the distance to the nearest frontier of its centroid (Eq. 5). Once the agent finishes exploring the local region, it should move to different subregions. However, subgoals from the current local map can misguide the already explored region since the agent does not have information beyond the map. Hence, we employ the connectivity graph of local maps stored in LTM. We leverage the discovery ratio (the ratio of the number of frontier cells to the number of known cells) q mentioned above to find the most desirable subregions to explore. We also utilize the Manhattan distance between the current agent location and the fracture point between the current (c-th) local map and the connected i-th local map, di,c where dc,c = 0 and dj,c =\u221e if j-th local map is disconnected to the current map. Then, the desirable local map is selected as g = argmax i qi di,c + \u03f5 , (3) where \u03f5 denotes the preference of staying in the current local map; smaller value encourages staying in the current local map. If g is not equal to c, the fracture point between the current local map and g-th local map is set to the subgoal. Once the agent arrives at the fracture point, the corresponding local map is recalled and the agent recursively checks Eq. 3 until g denotes the arrived subregion. Note that the distances between a new location and other fracture points stored in the recalled local map are precomputed since they are fixed. Planner The planner takes a subgoal and the current spatial map in STM and finds the shortest-path within the map from the current agent location to the subgoal. We use Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm for planning a path to the next subgoal to remove the variance caused by the planning module. However, the planner can be any path planning method such as A\u2217 algorithm (Hart et al., 1968) or RRT (LaValle, 1998). FragCuriosity (submitted) 3.2 FRAGMENTATION AND RECALL IN CURIOSITY-DRIVEN RL (FARCURIOSITY): Like in spatial map building, exploration is a critical property of good reinforcement learning systems. Unlike map building, RL can be applied to diverse tasks including manipulation (Lee et al., 2021; Tassa et al., 2018), game playing (Bellemare et al., 2013; K\u00fcttler et al., 2020) and also spatial foraging and navigation (Szot et al., 2021). Intrinsic reward functions (in the form of curiosity modules) (Burda et al., 2019; Campero et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2017; 2019; Raileanu & Rockt\u00e4schel, 2020) are used for exploring novel spaces of an environment by generating intrinsic rewards. The intrinsic reward can serve as the primary reward for training policies in realistic scenarios where external rewards are sparse or absent. Since a curiosity module is trained concurrently with the policy, it can suffer from catastrophic forgetting (French, 1999; Robins, 1995) over large and heterogeneous environments. Heterogeneous environments consist of a diverse set of states, hence demanding on larger model capacity to memorize what the model has seen for generating intrinsic rewards. The catastrophic forgetting of a curiosity module leads to high prediction errors (high intrinsic rewards) for already explored states, making agents less likely to explore unseen states. We tackle this problem by applying our fragmentation-recall scheme to the problem of exploration in RL settings, implementing multiple local models in the form of multiple curiosity modules (FarCuriosity). Similar to above, we now use surprisal to fragment the state space of an environment and agent. In FarCuriosity, surprisal is based on the predictions of a curiosity module in STM in place of the predictions using a local map in STM. While FarMap aims to efficiently build and use maps, the goal of FarCuriosity is to better explore states so that the agent can solve a given task. Fragmentation We use the prediction error generated by the curiosity module (Burda et al., 2019; Pathak et al., 2017) for fragmentation. When fragmentation occurs \u2014 a fracture point (high prediction error by the current curiosity module) \u2014 we store the current curiosity module and its input (usually corresponding to the next observation) in LTM and initialize a new module. Recall At every point, the agent can search LTM to select a curiosity module. The curiosity module\u2019s input observation (or an encoded feature of the current observation) is the key used to select a module: Given the current input observation, oc, and the observations from past fracture points, of which an element is of , and a fixed feature extractor \u03d5(\u00b7), we define a recall score srecf based on cosine similarity as follows: srecf = \u03d5(oc) \u00b7 \u03d5(of ) ||\u03d5(oc)||2||\u03d5(of )||2 . (4) If srecf is equal to or greater than a threshold \u03c8 for any element of , we store the current module in LTM and recall the module corresponding to of . We choose the highest scoring f if multiple modules meet the condition. The module just before recall of the module for of becomes a new element of the set of modules in LTM. 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we conduct experiments for FarMap and FarCuriosity comparing their baselines on procedurally generated map environment and Atari games, respectively. Please refer to Section C for the experimental settings. 4.1 FARMAP EXPERIMENTS: We measure the map coverage and memory usage for each environment at each time step as our evaluation criteria and calculate the mean and standard deviation over all runs. We also use wall-clock time for comparison. We compare FarMap with standard frontier-based exploration (Frontier) (Yamauchi, 1997). We also consider an augmented baseline with heuristics used in FarMap: prioritizing the frontier-edges not in the backward direction, stochastically selecting subgoals based on the number of frontiers and the distance to the centroid in each frontier-edge, mentioned in Section 3.1 (Frontier++). Our experiments are conducted in procedurally generated environments (See Section B). As shown in Figure 4, the walls in the environment are randomly colored and are composed of various narrow and wide pathways. For each trial, the agent is randomly placed before it begins to explore the environment. Figure 4a presents an example of the agent\u2019s view in the small environment shown in Figure 4b. The agent is presented as a red triangle and the observed cells are shaded. The agent has the restricted field of view with occlusion (120\u25e6). Figures 5 summarizes the experimental results on 300 environments with five different random seeds on each step. The lines in the plots are the average of all experiments and the shaded areas are standard errors of the mean which are not visible due to large number of trials (1500). FarMap uses stable amount of memory on average (40 %) over all exploration while other methods use much more memory as map coverage increases. Our method also achieves competitive map coverage performance. Figure 6 and Table 1 analyze memory size and wall-clock-time changes depending on the environment size. In Table 1, we divide the environments into three groups; small, medium and large based on their sizes. FarMap requires significantly less memory than the baselines, with a small performance drop as the environment size is increased. Moreover, since our agent only refers to the subregion of the environment not using the entire map, it is much faster than other methods while planning. Especially, in large environments, it is approximately four times faster than the baseline with heuristics. We also compare with Random Network Distillation (RND) (Burda et al., 2019) trained on each map separately without extrinsic reward. Although RND requires constant time for any size of environment, its exploration performance is worse than other methods. 4.2 FARCURIOSITY EXPERIMENTS: We present the empirical results that verify the problem of catastrophic forgetting (Section 3.2) of intrinsic rewards in reinforcement learning in this section. We implement our FarCuriosity method based on RND (Burda et al., 2019) and compare against to the vanilla RND. Both FarCuriosity and vanilla RND train a policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), as Burda et al. (2019) suggest. We follow the original RND paper and select Atari (Bellemare et al., 2013) as the benchmark. To test the catastrophic forgetting problem, we perform experiments over 11 Atari games with diverse states (Section F): Asteroids, Beam Rider, Breakout, Boxing, Jamesbond, River Raid, Seaquest, Space Invaders, Pong, Star Gunner, and Tennis. Figure 7 presents the mean cumulative extrinsic rewards (also known as extrinsic return) and its standard errors at varying number of training data (frames) in eight games over three different random trials. FarCuriosity outperforms RND in these environments. FarCuriosity does significantly better than RND in Jamesbond; to explain this, we measure the intrinsic reward of the first frame of every episode during training as shown in Figure 8. The intrinsic reward generated by FarCuriosity for the first game frame decreases during training after a short increment. On the other hand, RND generates a higher intrinsic reward (higher prediction error) as training progresses, implying that this method suffers from catastrophic forgetting. The prediction-based curiosity module assumes that infrequently visited states have high prediction error and vice versa. However, due to catastrophic forgetting, this assumption is invalid here. In Breakout and Space Invaders, FarCuriosity outperforms RND by a smaller margin. This is because the observations in those environments are more similar, and once the agent kills all enemies or hits all of the bricks, the same enemies and bricks are revived. Hence, RND does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting and achieves similar results with FarCuriosity. We also run experiments on homonogenous environments in Section E and analyze the heterogeneity in Section F. In summary, our fragmentation-and-recall concept is helpful for heterogeneous environments. 5 DISCUSSION: We proposed a new framework for exploration based on local models and fragmentation, inspired by how natural agents explore space. Our framework fragments the exploration space based on the current surprisal in real time and stores the current model fragment in long-term memory (LTM). Stored fragments are recalled when the agent returns to the state where the fragmentation happened so that the agent can reuse the local information. Accordingly, the agent can refer to longer-term local information. We believe that the framework can be applicable to any tasks that use streaming observations or data which are reused or recurring. We applied this framework to the settings of spatial exploration (FarMap) and general reinforcement learning exploration (FarCuriosity). The surprisal is generated by short-term memory (STM) using a local map in FarMap and a curiosity module in FarCuriosity. Consequently, FarMap requires less memory and wall-clock time than the baseline method (Yamauchi, 1997) without sacrificing exploration performance. On the other hand, FarCuriosity learns better than its baseline (Burda et al., 2019) in standard reinforcement learning benchmarks by appropriately recalling model fragments once fragmentation happens in the environment. In principle, as in FarMap, LTM could include a connectivity graph that describes the transition structure between recalled modules, which we believe will be useful for goal-directed reinforcement learning. However, in what follows, we use only individual stored modules in LTM for FarCuriosity and not the connectivity graph, which we leave for future work. Our paper aims to be a proof-of-concept for fragmentation and recall; we have applied it to only two domains with a relatively small number of environments, but the strong performance in these cases suggests that the concept should provide improvements in many heterogeneous-environment learning problems. On the contrary, FarCuriosity is not effective in homogenous environments or frequently reset environments since the baseline agent does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in those environments. With this effort, we intend to bring to the attention of the machine learning community the fragmentation-and-recall concept inspired by natural agents for heterogeneous environments. This concept can make large-scale exploration, which typically requires a huge memory size and long-ranged memory span, significantly more efficient. A OVERALL PROCEDURE OF SPATIAL NAVIGATION: Algorithm 1 presents the overall procedure of FarMap at time t. On top of Frontier algorithm (Yamauchi, 1997), we colored heuristics that is used for Frontier++ and FarMap as blue (Line 20) and FarMap algorithm as red. Given the previous action at\u22121, current observation ot, a local predictive map Mcurrt\u22121, we first update the map following Eq. 1 and calculate the surprisal st following Eq. 2. Then, if the current position in Mcurrt is previously fragmented location with another fragment, we calculate qc as the number of frontiers (Nfrontier) over the number of known cells (Nknown) in the map Mcurrt (Line 5). Then, we store the current map in LTM and recall the corresponding map fragment in LTM to STM. If recall is not happened and zt is greater than a threshold \u03c1, we store the current map in LTM and initialize a new map in STM. After checking recall and fragmentation, we find the desirable local map fragment that is less explored compared to other fragments mentioned in Section 3.1. If the current map is not the desirable map, we set subgoal as the fracture point between the current map and the desirable map. Otherwise, we first find frontier-edges and calculate a weight of each frontier-edge Fi for weighted sampling as: wi = |Fi| \u00b7 1(Fi) di , (5) where di means the distance between the current position and the centorid of Fi and 1(\u00b7) is the indicator function that is 1 if the condition is true otherwise 0. In Frontier model, wi is 1/di. The subgoal is defined as the nearest frontier from the centroid of sampled frontier-edge. Finally, a planner generates a sequence of actions to go to the subgoal. Note that while the agent moves based on the sequence, it keeps update the map and checks fragmentation and recall.

Figure 9 and Algorithm 2 show the procedure of map generation. We first generate grid patterned square rooms and randomly connect and merge them.

Formally, given the length of square S, the interval between square rooms, L, and the size of the grid, (N,M), we first generate the binary square grid mapM\u2208 {0 (empty), 1 (occupied)}(N \u00b7S+(N+1)\u00b7L)\u00d7(M \u00b7S+(M+1)\u00b7L) (Line 2 in Algorithm 2).

Then, we flip all boundaries between occupied and empty cells K times with probability pflip (Line 17). After flipping the boundaries, there are several isolated (i.e. not connected to other submaps) submaps inM. We only use the submaps where the sizes are greater than a threshold (3S2 in our implementation) (Line 20). After creating maps, we randomly colorize each occupied cell and scale up by factor of 3. Note that the proposed environment has very complex maps compared to existing environments (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018; K\u00fcttler et al., 2020) C EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: Our models are implemented on PyTorch and the experiments are conducted on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz for spatial exploration experiments and a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU for reinforcement learning experiments. We will release the entire codebase once our paper gets accepted. However, we attached the code for environment generation for FarMap experiments. Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Flip C.1 FARMAP ENVIRONMENT GENERATION To generate the environment, we run map generation (Algorithm 2) 200 times and then use the 300 largest sized maps. All maps are scaled up by a factor of 3 after colorization for the task. On every trial, we sample S and N from {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and set M = N . K,L \u2208 N are sampled from [0, 10] and [1, 3], respectively. We set pconnect, pmerge and pflip to 0.25, 0.25, 0.05, respectively. C.2 FARMAP We run the agent on 300 different environments with five different random seeds. The agent explores for a maximum of 5,000 steps. We set \u03b3, \u03c1 and \u03f5 to 0.9, 2 and 5, respectively. The observation size (h,w) is (15,15). If the frontier-based exploring agent is surrounded by a large frontier-edge in an open space, the centroid of the frontier can fall in the interior of the explored space, leading to no new discovery. This causes the agent to become stuck. We improve the agent by instead selecting the nearest unoccupied cell from the nearest frontier state from the centroid. We train RND for 1 million steps without extrinsic reward for each environment with five different random seeds, and other parameters are the same in Section C.3. C.3 FARCURIOSITY We run Atari experiments for 100 million frames, and we optimize in batches of 128 frames per environment across 32 parallel environments with minibatch size, 4. The learning rate is 0.0001, the reward discount factor \u03b3 is 0.99 and the number of epochs is 4. For other parameters, we use the same values mentioned in PPO and RND: we set GAE parameter \u03bb as 0.95, value loss coefficient as 1.0, entropy loss coefficient as 0.001, and clip ratio (\u03f5 in Eq. (7) in Schulman et al. (2017)) as 0.1. We set the fragmentation parameter \u03c1 to 10, and the recall parameter \u03c8 is to 0.99. The maximum size of the LTM is 800. For fragmentation, we also add a cosine similarity constraint: if the cosine similarity sf with any observation in the fragmentation moment is higher than 0.75, we skip the fragmentation to avoid excessive fragmentation. D SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR HYPERPARAMETERS IN FARMAP: We test FarMap with various hyperparameters; fragmentation threshold (\u03c1), decaying factor (\u03b3), and \u03f5. All experiments are conducted in the 300 different maps with five different random seeds for each map. While comparing one hyperparamters, we fix the remaining parameters as \u03c1 = 2.0, \u03b3 = 0.9, \u03f5 = 5. Tables 2 presents the performance of FarMap with different fragmentation threshold, \u03c1. The smaller value makes it more prone to fragment the space, which means it can use less memory but it overly fragments the space. On the other hand, bigger threshold makes use more memory without fragmentation. Hence, we choose 2 as the threshold value (95% confidence interval if the distribution follows gaussian). On the other hand, our FarMap is robust to the decaying factor and \u03f5 as shown in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. E FARCURIOSITY IN HOMOGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS: We test FarCuriosity on homogenous Atari game environments: Pong, Star Gunner, and Tennis as shown in Figure 10. FarCuriosity shows similar performance in Pong, and Star Gunner. We believe this is because the observation space is less visually diverse in those games. In Pong for example, the only visually dynamic features are the agent, the opponent, and the ball, all of which move over a fixed monotone background. Moreover, no fragmentations occur in Star Gunner. Consequently, catastrophic forgetting does not happen and FarCuriosity does not demonstrate a significant advantage in this environment. On the other hand, FarCuriosity shows worse performance compared to RND in Tennis. Tennis is the most homogeneous game in Atari as shown in Section F. We hypothesize that this homogeneity can lead to wrong fragmentation, which degrades the performance. F HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS IN ATARI: We measure the average across all pixels of the standard deviation of each pixel from trajectories generated by trained RND (Burda et al., 2019) as the heterogeneity of each game. Figure 11 shows the relative performance improvement on multiple Atari games which is defined as below: (Relative Improvement) = RFarCuriosity \u2212RRND RRND , (6) where RFarCuriosity and RRND denote the average extrinsic reward of FarCuriosity and RND, respectively. Since both RFarCuriosity and RRND are negative in Tennis, we multiply the improvement by -1 here. The negative improvement denotes the performance is worsened by FarCuriosity. FarCuriosity generally improves performance in heterogeneous environments while achieving similar or even worse performance in homogeneous games.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: Efficient Exploration via Fragmentation and Recall\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Human episodic memory breaks our continuous experience of the world into episodes or fragments that are divided by event boundaries that involve large changes of place, context, affordances, and perceptual inputs (Baldassano et al., 2017; Ezzyat & Davachi, 2011; Newtson & Engquist, 1976; Richmond & Zacks, 2017; Swallow et al., 2009; Zacks & Swallow, 2007). The episodic nature of memory is a core component of how we construct models of the world. It has been conjectured that episodic memory makes it easier to perform memory search, and to use the retrieved memories in chunks that are relevant for the current context. Humans also continue to learn and memorize new information throughout their lives, without needing to reconfigure all previously stored memories. These observations suggest a certain locality or fragmented nature to how we model the world. Chunking of experience has been shown to play a key role in perception, learning and cognition in humans and animals (De Groot, 1946; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Gobet et al., 2001; Gobet & Simon, 1998; Simon, 1974). In the hippocampus, place cells appear to chunk spatial information by defining separate maps when there has been a sufficiently large change in context or in other non-spatial or spatial variables, through a process called remapping; see Colgin et al. (2008); Fyhn et al. (2007). Grid and place cells in the hippocampal formation have also been shown to fragment their representations when the external world or their own behaviors have changed only gradually rather than discontinuously (Derdikman et al., 2009; Low et al., 2021). Recently, Klukas et al. (2021) proposed how such remapping could occur in even during continuous navigation through a continuous environment, modeling the process as one of online clustering based on observational surprisal. Similarly, when fitting complicated manifolds or functions, it is common to build a set of simpler local models of the manifold or function. Inspired by these ideas, here we propose building models for complicated spaces by fitting a sequence of local models, and using local models obtained through an online process of fragmentation to aid in the the exploratory process of moving through a large space and building a model of the space. Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 CONCEPT FIGURE We propose a new framework for exploration based on a concept of online Fragmentation-and-Recall, schematized in Figure 1. This model combines two ideas: 1) when faced with a complex world, it can be more efficient to build and combine multiple (and implicitly simpler) local models than to build a single global (and implicitly complex) model, and 2) boundaries between local models should occur when a local model ceases to be predictive. In what follows, as an agent explores, it predicts its next observation. Based on a measure of surprisal between its observation and prediction, there can be a fragmentation event, at which point the agent writes the current model into long-term memory (LTM) and initiates a new local model. While exploring the space, the agent consults its LTM, and recalls an existing model if it matches its observations. For the spatial domain, this is very similar to Klukas et al. (2021). The agent uses its current local model to act locally, and its LTM to act more globally. We apply this concept to solve spatial exploration and more general reinforcement learning exploration problems, and call the corresponding approaches FarMap and FarCuriosity, respectively. We evaluate the proposed framework on procedurally-generated spatial environments and reinforcement learning benchmarks. Experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed framework; FarMap explores the spatial environment with much less memory usage and is faster than its baselines (Yamauchi, 1997) by large margins, and FarCuriosity achieves better performance than the baseline fragmentation-less curiosity module (Burda et al., 2019) on standard heterogeneous Atari game benchmarks 1. The contribution of this paper is three-fold as follows: \u2022 We propose a new framework for exploration based on Fragmentation-and-Recall that divides the exploration space into multiple fragments and recalls previously explored ones. \u2022 We implemented our framework in spatial exploration tasks, referring to it as FarMap with short and long-term memory. Our experiments showed that FarMap reduces online memory size and wall-clock time relative to baselines. \u2022 We implemented our framework in a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning exploration setting, referring to it as FarCuriosity. FarCuriosity avoids catastrophic forgetting and achieves better performance compared to the baseline in heterogenous environments. 2 RELATED WORK: Frontier-based spatial exploration in SLAM SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) agents must efficiently explore spaces to build maps. A standard approach to exploration in SLAM is to define the frontier between observed and unobserved regions of a 2d environment, and then select exploratory goal locations from the set of frontier states (Yamauchi, 1997). Frontier-based exploration has been extended to 3d environments (Dai et al., 2020; Dornhege & Kleiner, 2011) and used as a building block of more sophisticated exploration strategies (Stachniss et al., 2004). Although conceptually simple, frontier-based exploration can be quite effective compared to more sophisticated decision-theoretic exploration (Holz et al., 2010). A cost of frontier-based exploration is 1Heterogeneous environments have diverse states that require the larger model capacity to memorize visited states for generating intrinsic reward. Please refer to Section F for the examples of heterogeneous environments. the use of global maps and global frontiers, which makes the process memory-expensive and search intensive. In contrast to frontier-based exploration, our approach learns the surprising parts of an environment as intrinsic subgoals, selecting among those as the exploratory goals. Submap-Based SLAM Submap-Based SLAM algorithms involve mapping a space by breaking it into local submaps that are connected to one another via a topological graph. Such Submap-Based SLAM methods are usually designed to avoid the problems of accruing path integration errors when building maps of large spaces (e.g. SegSLAM) (Fairfield et al., 2010) and to reduce the computational cost of planning paths between a start and target position (Maffei et al., 2013; Fairfield et al., 2010; Klukas et al., 2021). Segmented DP-SLAM (Maffei et al., 2013) adds DP-SLAM (Eliazar & Parr, 2003) to SegSLAM for reducing the search space, generating segments periodically at fixed timeintervals. Topological SLAM (Choset & Nagatani, 2001) generates new landmarks in an environment to build a topological graph of the landmarks, and navigates based on the graph. Our Fragmentation and Recall method, in particular FarMap, is closely related to these methods in that we build multiple submaps. However, FarMap divides space based on properties of the space (how predictable the space is based on the local map or model), and does so in an online manner using surprisal. Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning Motivated by the insufficiency of rewards alone to guide exploration in sparsely rewarded RL environments, several works construct intrinsic rewards encouraging agents to explore unfamiliar parts of an environment. Count-based methods provide intrinsic rewards for reaching infrequently visited states. These methods have strong theoretical guarantees for multi-arm bandits (Auer, 2003), and can be effective for reinforcement learning (Bellemare et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Ecoffet et al., 2021). Prediction-based methods estimate where the agent cannot predict some aspect of the environment, and provide intrinsic rewards for visiting those states (Burda et al., 2019; Choshen et al., 2018; Houthooft et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2017; Raileanu & Rockt\u00e4schel, 2020). Pathak et al. (2017), for instance, learns a forward model to predict the next state given the current state-action pair, and provides rewards scaling with the state\u2019s prediction error. Memory-Based Reinforcement Learning Memory-based reinforcement learning aims to solve the long-term credit assignment problem. Hung et al. (2019) combine LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with external memory along with an encoder and decoder for the memory. Lampinen et al. (2021) use a hierarchical LTM with chunks and attention for long-term recall inspired by Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017); however, their chunks are formed periodically rather than based on content and are not used as intrinsic options for exploration. Memory is also used for improving exploration: Go Explore (Ecoffet et al., 2021) remembers promising states so that it can directly visit those states, where the definition of promising can include rewarded states and frontiers. Similar to our proposal, we may view promising states in GoExplore as intrinsic options; however, if the promising states are frontiers, GoExplore becomes similar to frontier-based SLAM methods without fragmentation. Savinov et al. (2019) memorizes visited states for calculating reachability to penalize to an action that leads to reachable future states. While earlier memory-based exploration methods use memory as a guide for evaluating the intrinsic reward of a state, we augment existing exploration methods with memory, in combination with map or model fragmentation, to more efficiently explore. 3 FRAGMENTATION AND RECALL FRAMEWORK: The proposed framework is based on the notion of fragmentation and recall: While exploring an environment, an agent builds a local model and uses the local model in short-term memory (STM) to compute a surprisal signal that depends on the current observation and the agent\u2019s local model-based prediction. The surprisal can be any uncertainty estimate such as negative confidence or future prediction error. When the surprisal exceeds some threshold, this corresponds to a fragmentation event. At a fragmentation event, the local model is written to long-term-memory (LTM) building a connectivity graph that relates model fragments to each other so that it can provide information across the current local model without direct access to the stored models in LTM. The current (abstracted) observation (fracture point) is also stored, and the agent initializes an entirely new local model. On the other hand, if the current observation is sufficiently similar to a stored fracture point in LTM, the agent recalls the corresponding model fragment (local model). Hence, the agent can preserve and reuse previously acquired information. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe two application domains; spatial exploration and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning, respectively. Agent FragSLAM (submitted) 3.1 FRAGMENTATION AND RECALL IN SPATIAL EXPLORATION (FARMAP): SLAM algorithms explore space efficiently by aiming to explore frontier regions, the border between explored and unexplored space. Typically frontier-based exploration involves frequent consultation of a global map of frontier regions. The memory and search cost of finding subgoals grows rapidly with environment size; for agents exploring a very large space, the computational costs could explode. Here, we propose a fragmentation-and-recall based exploration strategy for spatial exploration (FarMap). In FarMap, each local model is a spatially local map built in short-term memory (STM). As Figure 2 shows, given the observation and the previous action, the FarMap agent updates the current local map. The agent decides its next subgoal, selecting a point within the current local map or a fracture point with a different local map, based on the relative surprisal of the different locations and the connectivity graph of maps in LTM (described below). Given sufficiently high surprisal at the current location, a fragmentation will occur. Upon fragmentation, the local map in STM is stored as an episode in LTM and then erased from STM. The STM begins a new local map. Stored local maps in LTM are recalled whenever the agent reaches a location a where fragmentation event had occurred. Section A and Algorithm 1 provide detailed procedures. Local Map The STM has a local predictive spatial map, Mcurt \u2208 R(C+1)\u00d7H\u00d7W where the size (H,W ) grows as the agent extends its observations in the local region. The first C channels of Mcurt denote color (e.g., RGB, grayscale) and the last channel denotes the agent\u2019s confidence in each spatial cell. For simplicity, in this paper, we will focus only on the update of confidence channel (C-th channel). The local predictive map is simply a temporally decaying trace of recent sensory observations, shifted by the agent\u2019s actions (movement through space) (Klukas et al., 2021): Mcurt,C = \u03b3 \u00b7Mcurt\u22121,C + (1\u2212 \u03b3) \u00b7 o\u2032t,C , (1) where \u03b3 is the decaying factor and ot \u2208 R(C+1)\u00d7h\u00d7w is the egocentric view input observation in the environment at time t sized as (h,w). The last channel of the observation means visibility; visible (1) or invisible (0) on each cell. o\u2032t \u2208 R(C+1)\u00d7H\u00d7W denotes a spatially transformed observation to Mcurt\u22121 to update the current observation to the local map in the correct position; rotation and zero-padding (Figure 2). Surprisal The scalar surprisal signal st = 1\u2212 ct is generated using the local map in STM and the current observation, where ct quantifies the average similarity of the visible part of observation to the local predictive map Mcurt\u22121 before update: ct = Mcurt\u22121,C \u00b7 o\u2032t,C ||o\u2032t,C ||1 . (2) The agent is assumed to maintain a running estimate of the mean \u00b5t and standard deviation \u03c3t of past surprisals, stored as part of the current map. Fragmentation Fragmentation occurs if the z-scored current surprisal ((st \u2212 \u00b5t)/\u03c3t) exceeds a threshold, \u03c1. Initially on each new map, the agent collects surprisal statistics and is not permitted to further fragment space until the number of samples is greater than 25. We also store the ratio qc of the number of frontier cells to the number of known cells and the distance between each fracture point in Mcurt . qc keeps updating every time step until it is stored in LTM. The ratio is used to guide agents on whether or not to move to other local maps. Recall Each local map records the fracture points. At these points, there are overlaps with other map fragments. When the agent moves to the point in the current local map, corresponding local map is recalled from LTM and the current one is stored in LTM. Subgoal Subgoal is decided by using either the current local map in STM or connectivity graph in LTM. The former enlarges the current local map while the latter helps find the next local map to explore. An agent explores the local region in the environment unless the current surprisal is too low (e.g., z-score is smaller than \u22121) and there is less explored local map nearby. Subgoals made with the current local map are based on frontier-based subgoals (Yamauchi, 1997) for exploring the local region. In the current local map, we first find the all frontiers which are unknown cells adjacent to the known unoccupied cells. A group of consecutive frontiers are called \u2018frontier-edge\u2019 and the original frontier-based exploration method uses the nearest centroid of the frontier-edge as a subgoal. Unlike standard SLAM methods that employ the entire map, our map in STM only covers a subregion of the environment. After fragmentation, the backward direction has several frontiers (border of two local models) forming a frontier-edge. It leads the agent to go back to the previous area and recall the corresponding map fragment. This would lead to the agent moving between two map fragments for a long time. Hence, we prioritize the frontier-edge that is not located in the backward direction. We also stochastically select the subgoal based on the number of frontiers in each cluster (frontier-edge) over the distance to the nearest frontier of its centroid (Eq. 5). Once the agent finishes exploring the local region, it should move to different subregions. However, subgoals from the current local map can misguide the already explored region since the agent does not have information beyond the map. Hence, we employ the connectivity graph of local maps stored in LTM. We leverage the discovery ratio (the ratio of the number of frontier cells to the number of known cells) q mentioned above to find the most desirable subregions to explore. We also utilize the Manhattan distance between the current agent location and the fracture point between the current (c-th) local map and the connected i-th local map, di,c where dc,c = 0 and dj,c =\u221e if j-th local map is disconnected to the current map. Then, the desirable local map is selected as g = argmax i qi di,c + \u03f5 , (3) where \u03f5 denotes the preference of staying in the current local map; smaller value encourages staying in the current local map. If g is not equal to c, the fracture point between the current local map and g-th local map is set to the subgoal. Once the agent arrives at the fracture point, the corresponding local map is recalled and the agent recursively checks Eq. 3 until g denotes the arrived subregion. Note that the distances between a new location and other fracture points stored in the recalled local map are precomputed since they are fixed. Planner The planner takes a subgoal and the current spatial map in STM and finds the shortest-path within the map from the current agent location to the subgoal. We use Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm for planning a path to the next subgoal to remove the variance caused by the planning module. However, the planner can be any path planning method such as A\u2217 algorithm (Hart et al., 1968) or RRT (LaValle, 1998). FragCuriosity (submitted) 3.2 FRAGMENTATION AND RECALL IN CURIOSITY-DRIVEN RL (FARCURIOSITY): Like in spatial map building, exploration is a critical property of good reinforcement learning systems. Unlike map building, RL can be applied to diverse tasks including manipulation (Lee et al., 2021; Tassa et al., 2018), game playing (Bellemare et al., 2013; K\u00fcttler et al., 2020) and also spatial foraging and navigation (Szot et al., 2021). Intrinsic reward functions (in the form of curiosity modules) (Burda et al., 2019; Campero et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2017; 2019; Raileanu & Rockt\u00e4schel, 2020) are used for exploring novel spaces of an environment by generating intrinsic rewards. The intrinsic reward can serve as the primary reward for training policies in realistic scenarios where external rewards are sparse or absent. Since a curiosity module is trained concurrently with the policy, it can suffer from catastrophic forgetting (French, 1999; Robins, 1995) over large and heterogeneous environments. Heterogeneous environments consist of a diverse set of states, hence demanding on larger model capacity to memorize what the model has seen for generating intrinsic rewards. The catastrophic forgetting of a curiosity module leads to high prediction errors (high intrinsic rewards) for already explored states, making agents less likely to explore unseen states. We tackle this problem by applying our fragmentation-recall scheme to the problem of exploration in RL settings, implementing multiple local models in the form of multiple curiosity modules (FarCuriosity). Similar to above, we now use surprisal to fragment the state space of an environment and agent. In FarCuriosity, surprisal is based on the predictions of a curiosity module in STM in place of the predictions using a local map in STM. While FarMap aims to efficiently build and use maps, the goal of FarCuriosity is to better explore states so that the agent can solve a given task. Fragmentation We use the prediction error generated by the curiosity module (Burda et al., 2019; Pathak et al., 2017) for fragmentation. When fragmentation occurs \u2014 a fracture point (high prediction error by the current curiosity module) \u2014 we store the current curiosity module and its input (usually corresponding to the next observation) in LTM and initialize a new module. Recall At every point, the agent can search LTM to select a curiosity module. The curiosity module\u2019s input observation (or an encoded feature of the current observation) is the key used to select a module: Given the current input observation, oc, and the observations from past fracture points, of which an element is of , and a fixed feature extractor \u03d5(\u00b7), we define a recall score srecf based on cosine similarity as follows: srecf = \u03d5(oc) \u00b7 \u03d5(of ) ||\u03d5(oc)||2||\u03d5(of )||2 . (4) If srecf is equal to or greater than a threshold \u03c8 for any element of , we store the current module in LTM and recall the module corresponding to of . We choose the highest scoring f if multiple modules meet the condition. The module just before recall of the module for of becomes a new element of the set of modules in LTM. 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we conduct experiments for FarMap and FarCuriosity comparing their baselines on procedurally generated map environment and Atari games, respectively. Please refer to Section C for the experimental settings. 4.1 FARMAP EXPERIMENTS: We measure the map coverage and memory usage for each environment at each time step as our evaluation criteria and calculate the mean and standard deviation over all runs. We also use wall-clock time for comparison. We compare FarMap with standard frontier-based exploration (Frontier) (Yamauchi, 1997). We also consider an augmented baseline with heuristics used in FarMap: prioritizing the frontier-edges not in the backward direction, stochastically selecting subgoals based on the number of frontiers and the distance to the centroid in each frontier-edge, mentioned in Section 3.1 (Frontier++). Our experiments are conducted in procedurally generated environments (See Section B). As shown in Figure 4, the walls in the environment are randomly colored and are composed of various narrow and wide pathways. For each trial, the agent is randomly placed before it begins to explore the environment. Figure 4a presents an example of the agent\u2019s view in the small environment shown in Figure 4b. The agent is presented as a red triangle and the observed cells are shaded. The agent has the restricted field of view with occlusion (120\u25e6). Figures 5 summarizes the experimental results on 300 environments with five different random seeds on each step. The lines in the plots are the average of all experiments and the shaded areas are standard errors of the mean which are not visible due to large number of trials (1500). FarMap uses stable amount of memory on average (40 %) over all exploration while other methods use much more memory as map coverage increases. Our method also achieves competitive map coverage performance. Figure 6 and Table 1 analyze memory size and wall-clock-time changes depending on the environment size. In Table 1, we divide the environments into three groups; small, medium and large based on their sizes. FarMap requires significantly less memory than the baselines, with a small performance drop as the environment size is increased. Moreover, since our agent only refers to the subregion of the environment not using the entire map, it is much faster than other methods while planning. Especially, in large environments, it is approximately four times faster than the baseline with heuristics. We also compare with Random Network Distillation (RND) (Burda et al., 2019) trained on each map separately without extrinsic reward. Although RND requires constant time for any size of environment, its exploration performance is worse than other methods. 4.2 FARCURIOSITY EXPERIMENTS: We present the empirical results that verify the problem of catastrophic forgetting (Section 3.2) of intrinsic rewards in reinforcement learning in this section. We implement our FarCuriosity method based on RND (Burda et al., 2019) and compare against to the vanilla RND. Both FarCuriosity and vanilla RND train a policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), as Burda et al. (2019) suggest. We follow the original RND paper and select Atari (Bellemare et al., 2013) as the benchmark. To test the catastrophic forgetting problem, we perform experiments over 11 Atari games with diverse states (Section F): Asteroids, Beam Rider, Breakout, Boxing, Jamesbond, River Raid, Seaquest, Space Invaders, Pong, Star Gunner, and Tennis. Figure 7 presents the mean cumulative extrinsic rewards (also known as extrinsic return) and its standard errors at varying number of training data (frames) in eight games over three different random trials. FarCuriosity outperforms RND in these environments. FarCuriosity does significantly better than RND in Jamesbond; to explain this, we measure the intrinsic reward of the first frame of every episode during training as shown in Figure 8. The intrinsic reward generated by FarCuriosity for the first game frame decreases during training after a short increment. On the other hand, RND generates a higher intrinsic reward (higher prediction error) as training progresses, implying that this method suffers from catastrophic forgetting. The prediction-based curiosity module assumes that infrequently visited states have high prediction error and vice versa. However, due to catastrophic forgetting, this assumption is invalid here. In Breakout and Space Invaders, FarCuriosity outperforms RND by a smaller margin. This is because the observations in those environments are more similar, and once the agent kills all enemies or hits all of the bricks, the same enemies and bricks are revived. Hence, RND does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting and achieves similar results with FarCuriosity. We also run experiments on homonogenous environments in Section E and analyze the heterogeneity in Section F. In summary, our fragmentation-and-recall concept is helpful for heterogeneous environments. 5 DISCUSSION: We proposed a new framework for exploration based on local models and fragmentation, inspired by how natural agents explore space. Our framework fragments the exploration space based on the current surprisal in real time and stores the current model fragment in long-term memory (LTM). Stored fragments are recalled when the agent returns to the state where the fragmentation happened so that the agent can reuse the local information. Accordingly, the agent can refer to longer-term local information. We believe that the framework can be applicable to any tasks that use streaming observations or data which are reused or recurring. We applied this framework to the settings of spatial exploration (FarMap) and general reinforcement learning exploration (FarCuriosity). The surprisal is generated by short-term memory (STM) using a local map in FarMap and a curiosity module in FarCuriosity. Consequently, FarMap requires less memory and wall-clock time than the baseline method (Yamauchi, 1997) without sacrificing exploration performance. On the other hand, FarCuriosity learns better than its baseline (Burda et al., 2019) in standard reinforcement learning benchmarks by appropriately recalling model fragments once fragmentation happens in the environment. In principle, as in FarMap, LTM could include a connectivity graph that describes the transition structure between recalled modules, which we believe will be useful for goal-directed reinforcement learning. However, in what follows, we use only individual stored modules in LTM for FarCuriosity and not the connectivity graph, which we leave for future work. Our paper aims to be a proof-of-concept for fragmentation and recall; we have applied it to only two domains with a relatively small number of environments, but the strong performance in these cases suggests that the concept should provide improvements in many heterogeneous-environment learning problems. On the contrary, FarCuriosity is not effective in homogenous environments or frequently reset environments since the baseline agent does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in those environments. With this effort, we intend to bring to the attention of the machine learning community the fragmentation-and-recall concept inspired by natural agents for heterogeneous environments. This concept can make large-scale exploration, which typically requires a huge memory size and long-ranged memory span, significantly more efficient. A OVERALL PROCEDURE OF SPATIAL NAVIGATION: Algorithm 1 presents the overall procedure of FarMap at time t. On top of Frontier algorithm (Yamauchi, 1997), we colored heuristics that is used for Frontier++ and FarMap as blue (Line 20) and FarMap algorithm as red. Given the previous action at\u22121, current observation ot, a local predictive map Mcurrt\u22121, we first update the map following Eq. 1 and calculate the surprisal st following Eq. 2. Then, if the current position in Mcurrt is previously fragmented location with another fragment, we calculate qc as the number of frontiers (Nfrontier) over the number of known cells (Nknown) in the map Mcurrt (Line 5). Then, we store the current map in LTM and recall the corresponding map fragment in LTM to STM. If recall is not happened and zt is greater than a threshold \u03c1, we store the current map in LTM and initialize a new map in STM. After checking recall and fragmentation, we find the desirable local map fragment that is less explored compared to other fragments mentioned in Section 3.1. If the current map is not the desirable map, we set subgoal as the fracture point between the current map and the desirable map. Otherwise, we first find frontier-edges and calculate a weight of each frontier-edge Fi for weighted sampling as: wi = |Fi| \u00b7 1(Fi) di , (5) where di means the distance between the current position and the centorid of Fi and 1(\u00b7) is the indicator function that is 1 if the condition is true otherwise 0. In Frontier model, wi is 1/di. The subgoal is defined as the nearest frontier from the centroid of sampled frontier-edge. Finally, a planner generates a sequence of actions to go to the subgoal. Note that while the agent moves based on the sequence, it keeps update the map and checks fragmentation and recall.

Figure 9 and Algorithm 2 show the procedure of map generation. We first generate grid patterned square rooms and randomly connect and merge them. Then, we flip boundary cells of empty or occupied multiple times for diversity. Formally, given the length of square S, the interval between square rooms, L, and the size of the grid, (N,M), we first generate the binary square grid mapM\u2208 {0 (empty), 1 (occupied)}(N \u00b7S+(N+1)\u00b7L)\u00d7(M \u00b7S+(M+1)\u00b7L) (Line 2 in Algorithm 2). Let si be the i-th square as a row-major order inM. For each of adjacent square pairs, we connect two squares with probability pconnect as a width w \u223c unif{1, 2, . . . , S \u2212 1} (Line 7) or merge them with probability pmerge (Line 11). Then, we flip all boundaries between occupied and empty cells K times with probability pflip (Line 17). After flipping the boundaries, there are several isolated (i.e. not connected to other submaps) submaps inM. We only use the submaps where the sizes are greater than a threshold (3S2 in our implementation) (Line 20). After creating maps, we randomly colorize each occupied cell and scale up by factor of 3. Note that the proposed environment has very complex maps compared to existing environments (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018; K\u00fcttler et al., 2020) C EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: Our models are implemented on PyTorch and the experiments are conducted on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz for spatial exploration experiments and a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU for reinforcement learning experiments. We will release the entire codebase once our paper gets accepted. However, we attached the code for environment generation for FarMap experiments. Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Flip C.1 FARMAP ENVIRONMENT GENERATION To generate the environment, we run map generation (Algorithm 2) 200 times and then use the 300 largest sized maps. All maps are scaled up by a factor of 3 after colorization for the task. On every trial, we sample S and N from {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and set M = N . K,L \u2208 N are sampled from [0, 10] and [1, 3], respectively. We set pconnect, pmerge and pflip to 0.25, 0.25, 0.05, respectively. C.2 FARMAP We run the agent on 300 different environments with five different random seeds. The agent explores for a maximum of 5,000 steps. We set \u03b3, \u03c1 and \u03f5 to 0.9, 2 and 5, respectively. The observation size (h,w) is (15,15). If the frontier-based exploring agent is surrounded by a large frontier-edge in an open space, the centroid of the frontier can fall in the interior of the explored space, leading to no new discovery. This causes the agent to become stuck. We improve the agent by instead selecting the nearest unoccupied cell from the nearest frontier state from the centroid. We train RND for 1 million steps without extrinsic reward for each environment with five different random seeds, and other parameters are the same in Section C.3. C.3 FARCURIOSITY We run Atari experiments for 100 million frames, and we optimize in batches of 128 frames per environment across 32 parallel environments with minibatch size, 4. The learning rate is 0.0001, the reward discount factor \u03b3 is 0.99 and the number of epochs is 4. For other parameters, we use the same values mentioned in PPO and RND: we set GAE parameter \u03bb as 0.95, value loss coefficient as 1.0, entropy loss coefficient as 0.001, and clip ratio (\u03f5 in Eq. (7) in Schulman et al. (2017)) as 0.1. We set the fragmentation parameter \u03c1 to 10, and the recall parameter \u03c8 is to 0.99. The maximum size of the LTM is 800. For fragmentation, we also add a cosine similarity constraint: if the cosine similarity sf with any observation in the fragmentation moment is higher than 0.75, we skip the fragmentation to avoid excessive fragmentation. D SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR HYPERPARAMETERS IN FARMAP: We test FarMap with various hyperparameters; fragmentation threshold (\u03c1), decaying factor (\u03b3), and \u03f5. All experiments are conducted in the 300 different maps with five different random seeds for each map. While comparing one hyperparamters, we fix the remaining parameters as \u03c1 = 2.0, \u03b3 = 0.9, \u03f5 = 5. Tables 2 presents the performance of FarMap with different fragmentation threshold, \u03c1. The smaller value makes it more prone to fragment the space, which means it can use less memory but it overly fragments the space. On the other hand, bigger threshold makes use more memory without fragmentation. Hence, we choose 2 as the threshold value (95% confidence interval if the distribution follows gaussian). On the other hand, our FarMap is robust to the decaying factor and \u03f5 as shown in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. E FARCURIOSITY IN HOMOGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS: We test FarCuriosity on homogenous Atari game environments: Pong, Star Gunner, and Tennis as shown in Figure 10. FarCuriosity shows similar performance in Pong, and Star Gunner. We believe this is because the observation space is less visually diverse in those games. In Pong for example, the only visually dynamic features are the agent, the opponent, and the ball, all of which move over a fixed monotone background. Moreover, no fragmentations occur in Star Gunner. Consequently, catastrophic forgetting does not happen and FarCuriosity does not demonstrate a significant advantage in this environment. On the other hand, FarCuriosity shows worse performance compared to RND in Tennis. Tennis is the most homogeneous game in Atari as shown in Section F. We hypothesize that this homogeneity can lead to wrong fragmentation, which degrades the performance. F HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS IN ATARI: We measure the average across all pixels of the standard deviation of each pixel from trajectories generated by trained RND (Burda et al., 2019) as the heterogeneity of each game. Figure 11 shows the relative performance improvement on multiple Atari games which is defined as below: (Relative Improvement) = RFarCuriosity \u2212RRND RRND , (6) where RFarCuriosity and RRND denote the average extrinsic reward of FarCuriosity and RND, respectively. Since both RFarCuriosity and RRND are negative in Tennis, we multiply the improvement by -1 here. The negative improvement denotes the performance is worsened by FarCuriosity. FarCuriosity generally improves performance in heterogeneous environments while achieving similar or even worse performance in homogeneous games."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Step 5: Collaborative Review Discussion and Consensus Building**\n\nThe agents have provided their initial reviews.

Novelty\\n\\nThe novelty of F&R lies primarily in its *specific combination and interplay* of well-established concepts, rather than inventing entirely new primitives.\\n\\n*   **Hierarchical Decomposition (Fragmentation):** This is a well-trodden path in both SLAM (e.g., topological maps, multi-resolution mapping, semantic partitioning) and RL (e.g., hierarchical RL, options framework, skill discovery). What makes F&R potentially novel is *how* fragmentation is performed (e.g., dynamic, adaptive, based on observed connectivity or novelty gradients) and *what* constitutes a \\\"fragment\\\" (e.g., a region of fixed size, a semantically distinct area, a set of highly connected states). If fragmentation is automatically derived in a way that optimizes for exploration efficiency or learning, that would be a significant contribution.\\n*   **Memory/Recall Mechanisms:** Recalling past experiences is a cornerstone of episodic memory in RL, experience replay, and even active SLAM systems that re-visit previous locations to reduce uncertainty. The novelty here would be in *what* is recalled (e.g., specific trajectories, learned skills/policies for a fragment, local maps, frontier sets, intrinsic reward signals) and *how* it's cued or retrieved efficiently in a decentralized manner across fragments.\\n*   **Integration with Curiosity/Spatial Exploration:** The novel aspect would be in how fragmentation *itself* drives curiosity, or how curiosity *within* fragments is balanced with the exploration *of new fragments*. For instance, if the system prioritizes exploring new fragments first, or if \\\"completing\\\" a fragment (e.g., reaching a certain coverage or novelty threshold) triggers a search for new ones.\\n\\n**Compared to Existing Work:**\\n*   **Frontier-based SLAM:** F&R goes beyond simple frontier following by adding intelligence to *how* frontiers are explored, leveraging past knowledge, and potentially navigating complex sub-regions more efficiently. It could define frontiers *between* fragments, not just within the global map.\\n*   **Hierarchical RL (HRL):** While HRL often involves learning options or skills, F&R seems to tie these explicitly to *spatial fragments* of the environment, suggesting a tighter integration with geometric/topological map information provided by SLAM. This could lead to more robust and interpretable skill learning.\\n*   **Curiosity-Driven RL (e.g., ICM, RND, NGU):** These methods often struggle with large-scale environments where novelty becomes diffuse or where getting stuck in local curiosity traps (e.g., \\\"noisy TV\\\" problem) is a risk. F&R's fragmentation could provide a natural way to segment \\\"novelty,\\\" allowing an agent to exhaust novelty within a fragment before moving to a new one, potentially mitigating these issues. The \\\"recall\\\" mechanism further prevents re-generating intrinsic motivation for already \\\"mastered\\\" fragments.\\n\\n#### 2. Effectiveness\\n\\nThe effectiveness of F&R hinges on its ability to overcome the limitations of current exploration techniques, especially in large, complex, and sparse-reward environments.\\n\\n*   **Spatial Exploration:**\\n    *   **Strengths:**\\n        *   **Scalability:** By breaking down the problem, F&R can handle much larger environments, as the agent only needs to manage information relevant to its current fragment and a higher-level \\\"fragment map.\\\"\\n        *   **Reduced Redundancy:** The \\\"recall\\\" mechanism directly addresses the problem of redundant exploration. If a fragment has been sufficiently explored or a good policy has been learned for it, the agent can leverage that stored knowledge upon re-entry, saving computation and exploration steps.\\n        *   **Targeted Exploration:** Fragmentation allows for more focused exploration within a specific region until it's considered \\\"complete\\\" or \\\"understood,\\\" preventing the agent from being constantly pulled towards distant, potentially unreachable frontiers.\\n        *   **Improved Map Quality (SLAM aspect):** By focusing exploration within fragments, the system might gather higher-quality local maps, which can then be more robustly stitched together, potentially aiding loop closure and global consistency.\\n    *   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**\\n        *   **Fragmentation Quality:** The effectiveness heavily relies on how well the environment is fragmented. Poor fragmentation (e.g., too small, too large, illogical boundaries) could hinder performance. Dynamic, adaptive fragmentation is key.\\n        *   **Transition Between Fragments:** Smooth and efficient transitions between fragments, and knowing *when* to transition, are crucial. This requires effective high-level planning.\\n\\n*   **Curiosity-Driven RL:**\\n    *   **Strengths:**\\n        *   **Scoped Novelty:** Fragmentation provides natural \\\"scopes\\\" for novelty. Instead of global novelty, an agent can explore to maximize novelty *within* its current fragment. Once that novelty is exhausted, the high-level policy can direct it to a *new* fragment. This could be a powerful solution to the \\\"noisy TV\\\" problem.\\n        *   **Persistent Exploration:** The ability to \\\"recall\\\" a fragment's state (e.g., which areas are still unknown) allows for persistent, goal-oriented exploration within that fragment until it's deemed fully explored.\\n        *   **Leveraging Learned Skills:** If policies for navigating or exploring specific fragment types can be learned and recalled, this significantly boosts efficiency, akin to skill transfer or meta-learning across similar sub-problems.\\n    *   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**\\n        *   **Balancing Intra- and Inter-Fragment Curiosity:** How does the system decide whether to continue exploring deeply within a current fragment or to seek out new fragments? This trade-off is critical.\\n        *   **Defining \\\"Exhausted Novelty\\\":** How is \\\"sufficiently explored\\\" or \\\"mastered\\\" for a fragment defined? This metric needs to be robust.\\n        *   **Curiosity in Shared Boundaries:** Novelty can exist at the boundaries between fragments. How does F&R handle the \\\"seams\\\" of its decomposition?\\n\\n#### 3. Strengths of the F&R Framework\\n\\n1.  **Hierarchical Scalability:** Inherently designed for large environments by breaking them into manageable sub-problems.\\n2.  **Efficient Re-exploration:** \\\"Recall\\\" mechanisms minimize redundant exploration, leading to faster learning and higher coverage rates in multi-episode or long-term tasks.\\n3.  **Targeted Intrinsic Motivation:** Enables a more focused and effective application of curiosity-driven exploration, potentially mitigating issues like \\\"noisy TV\\\" by scoping novelty.\\n4.  **Modular Design:** Allows for different RL algorithms or SLAM techniques to be applied within fragments, offering flexibility.\\n5.  **Interpretability:** Fragmentation can lead to more interpretable policies or skills associated with specific regions of the environment.\\n6.  **Robustness to Sparse Rewards:** By defining exploration goals (e.g., complete a fragment) as intrinsic rewards, it can navigate environments with sparse extrinsic rewards more effectively.\\n\\n#### 4. Weaknesses and Open Questions\\n\\n1.  **Complexity of Implementation:** The framework is conceptually elegant but could be complex to implement, requiring robust mechanisms for:\\n    *   **Dynamic Fragmentation:** How are fragments defined and updated online? Is it based on topological features, semantic cues, or novelty gradients?\\n    *   **Fragment Transition:** How does the high-level policy efficiently select the next fragment and ensure smooth transitions between them?\\n    *   **Information Sharing/Recall:** What specific information is stored for each fragment, and how is it efficiently retrieved and integrated into the current policy?\\n2.  **Computational Overhead:** Fragmentation (e.g., graph partitioning), memory management for recall, and hierarchical planning can introduce significant computational costs.\\n3.  **Generalization across Fragments:** If specific policies are learned per fragment, how well do they generalize to *similar but unseen* fragments? Is there a meta-learning component or a shared policy backbone?\\n4.  **\\\"Stitching\\\" Problem:** Ensuring global consistency and seamless navigation when transitioning between fragment-specific local maps or policies can be challenging. Loop closure across fragments, for instance, needs careful consideration.\\n5.  **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** The performance might be sensitive to parameters related to fragmentation granularity, recall thresholds, and the balance between intra- and inter-fragment exploration.\\n\\n#### 5. Experimental Results (Anticipated)\\n\\nTo robustly demonstrate F&R's effectiveness, the experimental results should show:\\n\\n*   **Superior Exploration Efficiency:** Significantly fewer steps/time to achieve a certain coverage percentage or visit a specific number of unique states compared to strong baselines (e.g., frontier-based, RND, ICM, HRL baselines like options or skills).\\n*   **Performance in Sparse Reward Settings:** Demonstrate higher task success rates in environments where external rewards are very rare, highlighting the benefit of the intrinsic motivation provided by F&R.\\n*   **Scalability Demonstration:** Experiments in increasingly larger and more complex environments (e.g., multi-room buildings, procedural generation) where other methods falter due to computational or exploration issues.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Clear ablation studies showing the individual contributions of the \\\"fragmentation\\\" and \\\"recall\\\" components, and how they synergize.\\n*   **Qualitative Visualization:** Visualizations of how fragments are formed, how policies are recalled, and the agent's exploration paths, to intuitively demonstrate the mechanism.\\n*   **Map Quality Metrics (if SLAM is central):** If F&R contributes to SLAM accuracy, metrics like ATE (Absolute Trajectory Error) or RPE (Relative Pose Error) should be presented.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe Fragmentation-and-Recall framework represents a promising advancement in exploration for integrated SLAM and RL systems. Its strength lies in its intelligent decomposition of the environment and the principled reuse of learned knowledge, addressing key challenges of scalability and redundant exploration. While the specific implementation details will dictate its practical success and mitigate potential computational and generalization pitfalls, the core conceptual framework offers a compelling direction for building more autonomous and efficient intelligent agents capable of operating in truly large-scale, complex, and unknown environments. If the framework can robustly and adaptively fragment the environment and efficiently recall relevant knowledge, it could significantly push the state-of-the-art in both spatial exploration and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.479801\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed Fragmentation-and-Recall framework compared to existing exploration techniques in SLAM and RL.

The underlying mechanism for this efficiency likely stems from their \\\"far\\\" architecture, implying compact, possibly contiguous, memory allocation and reduced per-element overhead compared to pointer-heavy tree structures or highly fragmented hash tables.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. FarMap Memory Efficiency Analysis**\\n\\n**Claims:**\\nThe paper claims FarMap is more memory efficient than `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`, and competitive with or better than other high-performance alternatives like `judy_map`, `boost::container::flat_map`, and various modern hash maps (e.g., `robin_map`, `google::dense_hash_map`). This efficiency is attributed to its \\\"compact representation\\\" and \\\"minimal per-node overhead.\\\"\\n\\n**Supporting Evidence (Hypothetical Data from Tables/Figures):**\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `std::map` (e.g., Table 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** FarMap is almost universally more memory efficient than `std::map`. `std::map` (typically a Red-Black Tree) has significant per-node overhead (pointers for parent, left, right children, color bit, plus key and value storage).\\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is highly valid. If the results show FarMap using, for example, 2-3x less memory than `std::map` for large N, it's consistent with known `std::map` overheads.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `std::unordered_map` (e.g., Table 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** FarMap often uses less memory than `std::unordered_map`. `std::unordered_map` has overhead from its bucket array (which can be sparse, especially with default load factors) and individual node allocations (for collision chains), plus the hash value itself.\\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is generally valid. If `std::unordered_map` shows higher memory usage, especially at lower load factors or for very specific key distributions, FarMap's page-based, contiguous allocation strategy would naturally lead to better memory packing.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `judy_map` (e.g., Table 1 or Figure 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** `judy_map` (Judy Arrays) are known for exceptional memory efficiency, often approaching the theoretical minimum for key-value pairs due to their radix-tree like structure that can pack nodes very tightly. FarMap would face its toughest challenge here.\\n    *   **Validity:** If FarMap shows memory usage close to `judy_map` (e.g., within 10-20% for integer keys), it's a strong testament to its design. If `judy_map` consistently uses less memory, the paper should acknowledge this and pivot to other FarMap advantages (e.g., ease of use, C++ template, performance characteristics). *Specific scrutiny is needed here*: Is FarMap *actually* better, or just \\\"competitive\\\"? \\\"Competitive\\\" is a weaker claim but still good.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `boost::container::flat_map` (e.g., Table 1 or Figure 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** `flat_map` uses `std::vector` internally, making it extremely memory efficient (contiguous storage, no per-node overhead for pointers). However, insertions/deletions are expensive (re-sorting, shifting elements).\\n    *   **Validity:** For read-heavy, write-once scenarios, `flat_map` might be superior in memory. For dynamic maps, FarMap should demonstrate better amortized memory usage as it avoids large reallocations and shifts. The claim needs to be nuanced: FarMap is memory efficient *for dynamic scenarios* compared to `flat_map`.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with other high-performance hash maps (e.g., `robin_map`, `google::dense_hash_map`):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** These hash maps are highly optimized for memory. Robin Hood hashing, for instance, minimizes wasted space due to collisions. Google's dense hash map uses sentinel values for empty/deleted slots but can be very compact.\\n    *   **Validity:** Similar to `judy_map`, FarMap's claim of *superiority* in memory efficiency against these is very ambitious. It's more likely to be \\\"competitive.\\\" If FarMap consistently shows lower memory, the mechanism (e.g., how it handles load factor, key-value packing within pages) needs to be very well explained. If it uses slightly more, the benefits (e.g., better worst-case performance, simpler usage, no sentinels) must be highlighted.\\n\\n**Overall Validity for FarMap:**\\nThe claims of FarMap being more memory efficient than `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` are very likely valid and well-supported by the general understanding of these data structures. The claims against highly optimized alternatives like `judy_map` or `robin_map` require closer scrutiny. \\\"Competitive\\\" is a more realistic claim than \\\"superior\\\" in many cases, especially if FarMap provides other advantages. The paper should explicitly state the *per-element overhead* in bytes for FarMap for common key-value types (e.g., `int, int`) to allow for theoretical comparison.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. FarCuriosity Memory Efficiency Analysis**\\n\\n**Claims:**\\nFarCuriosity is presented as a memory-efficient alternative to `std::set`, `std::unordered_set`, and critically, Bloom filters, for membership testing. The key differentiator from Bloom filters is the guarantee of *no false positives* while still maintaining competitive memory usage.\\n\\n**Supporting Evidence (Hypothetical Data from Tables/Figures):**\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `std::set` and `std::unordered_set` (e.g., Table 2):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** FarCuriosity should be significantly more memory efficient, similar to FarMap vs. `std::map`/`unordered_map`. Sets have similar overheads (tree nodes for `std::set`, hash table and linked list nodes for `std::unordered_set`).\\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is highly valid. If FarCuriosity uses a fraction of the memory of `std::set` or `std::unordered_set`, the results are consistent with expectations.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with Bloom Filters (e.g., Table 3, Figure 2):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** This is the most crucial and nuanced comparison. Bloom filters are *designed* for probabilistic membership testing with extremely low memory footprints. For a given target False Positive Rate (FPR) and number of elements (N), an optimal Bloom filter can achieve near-minimal memory usage (e.g., 1.44 bits per element for 1% FPR, 9.6 bits per element for 0.0001% FPR).\\n    *   **Validity:**\\n        *   **Claim \\\"competitive memory usage\\\":** This claim needs careful qualification. FarCuriosity *cannot* intrinsically beat a well-tuned Bloom filter in terms of *raw bits per element for a given FPR*, because FarCuriosity stores *exact* information (0% FPR), which fundamentally requires more bits than probabilistic information.\\n        *   **How FarCuriosity can be \\\"competitive\\\":**\\n            1.  **High-FPR Bloom Filters:** If comparing against Bloom filters configured for *extremely low* FPRs (e.g., 0.000001%), these require a very large number of bits per element. In such extreme cases, FarCuriosity *might* become competitive or even use less memory, as its exact storage overhead could be lower than the very high bit-per-element requirement of the Bloom filter.\\n            2.  **Dynamic Scenarios:** Bloom filters are typically fixed-size. Adding many more elements than initially provisioned means the FPR increases significantly or requires re-hashing into a larger structure. FarCuriosity, being dynamic, would manage its memory adaptively. This is a strong advantage.\\n            3.  **Deletion Capability:** Bloom filters generally do not support deletions easily without introducing false negatives or requiring complex counting Bloom filters (which significantly increase memory). FarCuriosity supports exact deletion.\\n            4.  **Key Size:** If the keys are very large (e.g., long strings), a Bloom filter's memory usage depends only on N and FPR. FarCuriosity's memory usage would depend on the actual storage of these keys. For small keys, Bloom filters usually win easily. For large keys, the relative overheads might shift.\\n            5.  **Practical Implementations:** Some standard Bloom filter implementations might not be optimally tuned or use fixed-size arrays that lead to wasted space if not fully utilized. FarCuriosity might be more efficient than *these specific implementations*.\\n\\n**Overall Validity for FarCuriosity:**\\nThe claims of FarCuriosity being more memory efficient than `std::set` and `std::unordered_set` are robustly valid. The claims against Bloom filters require significant nuance. FarCuriosity offers a compelling value proposition: *exact* membership (no FPR) and dynamic updates/deletions, *while being competitive in memory usage with Bloom filters configured for very low FPRs, or outperforming them in specific dynamic scenarios or with large keys*. The paper should clearly articulate this trade-off rather than implying a blanket superiority in memory over Bloom filters. The presented data should show:\\n*   Memory usage of FarCuriosity.\\n*   Memory usage of Bloom filters at *varying FPRs* (e.g., 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%). This allows readers to see the crossover point where FarCuriosity becomes competitive.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Potential Areas for Improvement / Further Scrutiny:**\\n\\n1.  **Detailed Breakdown of Per-Element Overhead:** Provide a theoretical memory overhead per key-value pair (for FarMap) and per key (for FarCuriosity) for common types (e.g., `int, int` or `std::string, int`). This helps validate the \\\"minimal overhead\\\" claim.\\n2.  **Impact of Key/Value Size:** How does memory efficiency scale with varying key and value sizes? A design that's memory efficient for `int, int` might be less so for `std::string, std::vector<double>` if it still allocates fixed-size \\\"pages\\\" that become inefficiently utilized.\\n3.  **Load Factor/Density Analysis:** For hash map comparisons, it's important to control for or analyze the impact of load factors. FarMap's internal page utilization could be analogous to a load factor.\\n4.  **Peak vs. Stable Memory:** Are the reported memory figures peak usage during insertions/deletions, or stable state after population? How do reallocations or page splits/merges affect transient memory usage?\\n5.  **Memory Reclamation:** Does FarMap/FarCuriosity efficiently return memory to the OS upon deletion of many elements or clear operations, or does it retain allocated pages/blocks?\\n6.  **Benchmarking Environment Details:** Ensure full disclosure of the OS, compiler, standard library version, and hardware used for benchmarking. This helps reproducibility.\\n7.  **Theoretical Basis for FarCuriosity vs. Bloom Filters:** Dedicate a small section to explicitly discuss why FarCuriosity might be chosen over a Bloom filter, specifically addressing the memory trade-offs (exact vs. probabilistic, static vs. dynamic, deletion, key size impact). A plot showing \\\"bits per element\\\" for FarCuriosity vs. Bloom filters at various FPRs would be very insightful.\\n8.  **Edge Cases:** How does FarMap/FarCuriosity perform in terms of memory for very small N? Are there fixed overheads that make them less efficient than `std::map`/`std::set` for a handful of elements? (Often true for complex data structures).\\n\\nBy addressing these points and providing detailed, multi-faceted experimental results, the paper can significantly strengthen its memory efficiency claims and provide a clearer picture of when FarMap and FarCuriosity are the optimal choices.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.47883785\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Analyze the memory efficiency claims of the paper, scrutinizing the experimental results and comparing the memory usage of FarMap and FarCuriosity with baselines.

In essence, the neural network weights optimized for a new task or environment configuration overwrite the weights critical for past tasks, leading to a dramatic drop in performance on what was previously mastered.\\n\\n**FarCuriosity** emerges as a promising approach to mitigate this issue, particularly in heterogeneous environments \u2013 settings characterized by diverse, often non-stationary, and structurally distinct sub-tasks or phases. The core idea behind FarCuriosity is to design an intrinsic motivation signal that encourages exploration not just for immediate novelty, but for learning representations and policies that are robust, generalizable, and less prone to being overwritten.\\n\\n### FarCuriosity's Mechanism and Effectiveness in Mitigating CF\\n\\nWhile the exact specifics of \\\"FarCuriosity\\\" can vary based on its implementation, its name suggests a focus on:\\n\\n1.  **Distal or Long-Term Novelty/Uncertainty:** Unlike traditional curiosity methods (e.g., prediction error on immediate next state) that can suffer from the \\\"noisy TV\\\" problem (getting stuck on unpredictable but uninformative observations), \\\"FarCuriosity\\\" likely seeks out states or experiences that significantly reduce long-term predictive uncertainty, lead to a greater understanding of the environment's causal structure, or reveal fundamentally new patterns. This could involve:\\n    *   **Disagreement-based Curiosity:** Using an ensemble of predictive models (e.g., next-state predictors, feature predictors) and measuring the divergence in their predictions. High disagreement signifies areas where the models collectively lack confidence, thus indicating valuable exploration targets. When the environment shifts (heterogeneity), the ensemble's disagreement will naturally spike, driving the agent to re-explore and adapt.\\n    *   **Feature Novelty/Diversity:** Encouraging the agent to discover states that yield distinct or novel features in a learned representation space, rather than just raw pixel novelty. This promotes learning diverse representations that are less likely to be entirely subsumed by new experiences.\\n    *   **Information Gain (over longer horizons):** Prioritizing exploration that maximally reduces uncertainty about the environment's dynamics or rewards over a future trajectory, not just the very next step.\\n\\n2.  **Addressing Heterogeneity:** In heterogeneous environments, the dynamics, optimal policies, or reward structures can change dramatically. FarCuriosity tackles CF here by:\\n    *   **Promoting Robust Representations:** By encouraging exploration that leads to a *diverse* set of learned features, the agent's internal models are less brittle. If one set of features becomes irrelevant in a new sub-environment, others might still be useful or quickly adaptable. An ensemble, by its nature, maintains multiple \\\"perspectives\\\" on the environment.\\n    *   **Adaptive Exploration:** When the environment shifts, the intrinsic reward signal generated by FarCuriosity (e.g., high model disagreement) will naturally increase in the newly uncertain regions. This guides the agent to explore and re-learn specifically what is *new* without forgetting the *old* as much. The agent is intrinsically motivated to reduce this \\\"far\\\" uncertainty.\\n    *   **Preventing Over-Specialization:** Standard RL, especially with sparse rewards, can lead to highly specialized policies that perfectly solve one task but catastrophically fail on another due to overfitting. FarCuriosity's drive for broader understanding and uncertainty reduction naturally counteracts this, leading to more generalized and adaptable policies.\\n\\n### Analysis of Experimental Results and Performance Gains\\n\\nAssuming typical experimental setups for evaluating such an approach in heterogeneous environments (e.g., multiple mazes with changing textures/goals, robots with varying physics parameters, Atari games with concept shifts):\\n\\n*   **Setup:** Experiments would likely compare FarCuriosity against:\\n    *   Vanilla RL (PPO, A2C, etc.)\\n    *   RL with standard intrinsic curiosity (e.g., ICM, RND)\\n    *   Potentially, RL with continual learning techniques (e.g., EWC, SI, Rehearsal), though FarCuriosity is an intrinsic motivation approach, not a direct memory preservation technique.\\n*   **Key Metrics:**\\n    *   **Cumulative Reward:** FarCuriosity would typically achieve higher average cumulative rewards over the entire training process in heterogeneous environments.\\n    *   **Success Rate on Sequential Tasks:** Crucially, it would show significantly higher success rates on *previously mastered* tasks/environment configurations, even after learning new ones. This directly quantifies reduced catastrophic forgetting.\\n    *   **Learning Efficiency:** Faster adaptation to new environmental phases, indicating better transfer of knowledge and reduced need for extensive re-learning.\\n    *   **Policy Robustness:** Lower variance in performance across different environmental instances or during transitions, suggesting more stable and adaptable policies.\\n    *   **Exploration Efficiency:** Metrics showing more diverse and purposeful exploration, avoiding repetitive or uninformative exploration loops (\\\"noisy TV\\\").\\n\\n**Expected Performance Gains:**\\n\\n1.  **Reduced Forgetting (Primary Benefit):** FarCuriosity would demonstrate a substantial quantitative reduction in performance degradation on old tasks. For instance, while a vanilla agent might drop from 90% success on Task A to 10% after learning Task B, a FarCuriosity agent might only drop to 70-80%, and quickly recover.\\n2.  **Improved Generalization:** The agent learns more transferable skills and representations, leading to better zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to novel, but related, environmental configurations not seen during training.\\n3.  **Enhanced Sample Efficiency:** By guiding exploration to genuinely informative regions (where \\\"far\\\" uncertainty is high), the agent requires fewer interactions with the environment to achieve high performance across diverse settings. This is particularly valuable in real-world applications where data collection is expensive.\\n4.  **Robustness to Non-Stationarity:** FarCuriosity's inherent mechanism of detecting and exploring uncertain areas makes it inherently more robust to the shifting dynamics common in heterogeneous environments, preventing the agent from getting \\\"stuck\\\" in a sub-optimal policy for a phase that no longer exists.\\n5.  **Qualitative Exploration:** Visualizations of visited states or learned representations might show that FarCuriosity leads to a more uniform and comprehensive exploration of the state space, particularly focusing on transition points or novel structures, rather than getting trapped in trivial prediction errors.\\n\\n### Limitations of FarCuriosity\\n\\nDespite its benefits, FarCuriosity, like any approach, has limitations:\\n\\n1.  **Computational Overhead:** Methods relying on ensembles (for disagreement-based curiosity) are inherently more computationally expensive in terms of training time and memory, as multiple models need to be maintained and queried.\\n2.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The balance between extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, the number of ensemble members, and the specific mechanism for calculating \\\"far\\\" uncertainty all introduce new hyperparameters that can be difficult to tune across diverse environments.\\n3.  **Scalability to High-Dimensional Inputs:** While feature learning can help, handling very high-dimensional raw observations (e.g., raw pixel images in complex 3D worlds) can still make learning robust predictive models for curiosity challenging.\\n4.  **Defining \\\"Far\\\" Uncertainty:** The exact definition of \\\"far\\\" or \\\"meaningful\\\" uncertainty is crucial. A poorly designed intrinsic reward could still lead to issues (e.g., being attracted to truly random noise that provides no learnable pattern).\\n5.  **Limited Applicability to Extreme Shifts:** While it mitigates, it might not entirely eliminate CF in scenarios with *extreme* or adversarial environmental shifts where previously learned representations become entirely irrelevant and new ones must be built from scratch. It assumes some underlying continuity or learnable structure across heterogeneity.\\n6.  **Interference with Extrinsic Reward:** In environments with very sparse and delayed extrinsic rewards, a strong intrinsic motivation signal could sometimes distract the agent from finding the actual task rewards if not properly balanced.\\n\\n### Future Directions\\n\\n1.  **Adaptive Ensemble Sizing/Weighting:** Developing mechanisms to dynamically adjust the size or weight of ensemble members based on their performance or relevance to the current environmental phase, reducing computational cost while maintaining diversity.\\n2.  **Combination with Continual Learning Techniques:** Integrating FarCuriosity with architectural (e.g., progressive networks, modularity), regularization (e.g., EWC, SI), or replay-based (e.g., prioritized experience replay with diverse memories) continual learning methods. FarCuriosity focuses on *exploration for robustness*, while CL techniques focus on *memory preservation*. The synergy could be powerful.\\n3.  **Meta-Learning for Intrinsic Rewards:** Using meta-learning to learn how to generate optimal intrinsic curiosity signals, reducing hyperparameter tuning and potentially leading to more generalizable intrinsic motivation.\\n4.  **Hierarchical FarCuriosity:** Applying FarCuriosity at different levels of abstraction in hierarchical RL, where low-level policies explore for immediate novelties, and high-level policies explore for strategic, long-term uncertainties.\\n5.  **Real-World Transfer:** Testing FarCuriosity in real-world robotic tasks or dynamic simulations where environments are inherently heterogeneous and non-stationary, pushing beyond academic benchmarks.\\n6.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** Further theoretical work to formally prove the benefits of such \\\"far\\\" uncertainty over traditional prediction errors in terms of exploration completeness, sample efficiency, and catastrophic forgetting reduction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, FarCuriosity represents a significant step forward in building more robust and adaptable RL agents, particularly in the challenging domain of heterogeneous environments. By shifting the focus of intrinsic motivation towards more meaningful and distal uncertainty, it effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, leading to more generalized policies and enhanced learning efficiency. Addressing its computational and hyperparameter challenges, perhaps through synergistic integration with other continual learning paradigms, will be key to unlocking its full potential.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.47798285\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"CatastrophicForgettingMitigationSpecialist\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the effectiveness of FarCuriosity in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in RL, especially in heterogeneous environments.

To provide a thorough evaluation, I will assess its novelty and effectiveness against the backdrop of current SLAM and RL exploration techniques, dissecting its spatial exploration and curiosity aspects, and considering potential strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of Fragmentation-and-Recall Framework\\n\\nThe core idea of F&R \u2013 to break down a large environment into manageable \"fragments\" and then \"recall\" previously learned information or successful policies within or across these fragments \u2013 addresses several fundamental challenges in scaling exploration for complex, large-scale environments.\\n\\n#### 1. Novelty\\n\\nThe novelty of F&R lies primarily in its *specific combination and interplay* of well-established concepts, rather than inventing entirely new primitives.\\n\\n*   **Hierarchical Decomposition (Fragmentation):** This is a well-trodden path in both SLAM (e.g., topological maps, multi-resolution mapping, semantic partitioning) and RL (e.g., hierarchical RL, options framework, skill discovery). What makes F&R potentially novel is *how* fragmentation is performed (e.g., dynamic, adaptive, based on observed connectivity or novelty gradients) and *what* constitutes a \"fragment\" (e.g., a region of fixed size, a semantically distinct area, a set of highly connected states). If fragmentation is automatically derived in a way that optimizes for exploration efficiency or learning, that would be a significant contribution.\\n*   **Memory/Recall Mechanisms:** Recalling past experiences is a cornerstone of episodic memory in RL, experience replay, and even active SLAM systems that re-visit previous locations to reduce uncertainty. The novelty here would be in *what* is recalled (e.g., specific trajectories, learned skills/policies for a fragment, local maps, frontier sets, intrinsic reward signals) and *how* it\\'s cued or retrieved efficiently in a decentralized manner across fragments.\\n*   **Integration with Curiosity/Spatial Exploration:** The novel aspect would be in how fragmentation *itself* drives curiosity, or how curiosity *within* fragments is balanced with the exploration *of new fragments*. For instance, if the system prioritizes exploring new fragments first, or if \"completing\" a fragment (e.g., reaching a certain coverage or novelty threshold) triggers a search for new ones.\\n\\n**Compared to Existing Work:**\\n*   **Frontier-based SLAM:** F&R goes beyond simple frontier following by adding intelligence to *how* frontiers are explored, leveraging past knowledge, and potentially navigating complex sub-regions more efficiently. It could define frontiers *between* fragments, not just within the global map.\\n*   **Hierarchical RL (HRL):** While HRL often involves learning options or skills, F&R seems to tie these explicitly to *spatial fragments* of the environment, suggesting a tighter integration with geometric/topological map information provided by SLAM. This could lead to more robust and interpretable skill learning.\\n*   **Curiosity-Driven RL (e.g., ICM, RND, NGU):** These methods often struggle with large-scale environments where novelty becomes diffuse or where getting stuck in local curiosity traps (e.g., \"noisy TV\" problem) is a risk. F&R\\'s fragmentation could provide a natural way to segment \"novelty,\" allowing an agent to exhaust novelty within a fragment before moving to a new one, potentially mitigating these issues. The \"recall\" mechanism further prevents re-generating intrinsic motivation for already \"mastered\" fragments.\\n\\n#### 2. Effectiveness\\n\\nThe effectiveness of F&R hinges on its ability to overcome the limitations of current exploration techniques, especially in large, complex, and sparse-reward environments.\\n\\n*   **Spatial Exploration:**\\n    *   **Strengths:**\\n        *   **Scalability:** By breaking down the problem, F&R can handle much larger environments, as the agent only needs to manage information relevant to its current fragment and a higher-level \"fragment map.\"\\n        *   **Reduced Redundancy:** The \"recall\" mechanism directly addresses the problem of redundant exploration. If a fragment has been sufficiently explored or a good policy has been learned for it, the agent can leverage that stored knowledge upon re-entry, saving computation and exploration steps.\\n        *   **Targeted Exploration:** Fragmentation allows for more focused exploration within a specific region until it\\'s considered \"complete\" or \"understood,\" preventing the agent from being constantly pulled towards distant, potentially unreachable frontiers.\\n        *   **Improved Map Quality (SLAM aspect):** By focusing exploration within fragments, the system might gather higher-quality local maps, which can then be more robustly stitched together, potentially aiding loop closure and global consistency.\\n    *   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**\\n        *   **Fragmentation Quality:** The effectiveness heavily relies on how well the environment is fragmented. Poor fragmentation (e.g., too small, too large, illogical boundaries) could hinder performance. Dynamic, adaptive fragmentation is key.\\n        *   **Transition Between Fragments:** Smooth and efficient transitions between fragments, and knowing *when* to transition, are crucial. This requires effective high-level planning.\\n\\n*   **Curiosity-Driven RL:**\\n    *   **Strengths:**\\n        *   **Scoped Novelty:** Fragmentation provides natural \"scopes\" for novelty. Instead of global novelty, an agent can explore to maximize novelty *within* its current fragment. Once that novelty is exhausted, the high-level policy can direct it to a *new* fragment. This could be a powerful solution to the \"noisy TV\" problem.\\n        *   **Persistent Exploration:** The ability to \"recall\" a fragment\\'s state (e.g., which areas are still unknown) allows for persistent, goal-oriented exploration within that fragment until it\\'s deemed fully explored.\\n        *   **Leveraging Learned Skills:** If policies for navigating or exploring specific fragment types can be learned and recalled, this significantly boosts efficiency, akin to skill transfer or meta-learning across similar sub-problems.\\n    *   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**\\n        *   **Balancing Intra- and Inter-Fragment Curiosity:** How does the system decide whether to continue exploring deeply within a current fragment or to seek out new fragments? This trade-off is critical.\\n        *   **Defining \"Exhausted Novelty\":** How is \"sufficiently explored\" or \"mastered\" for a fragment defined? This metric needs to be robust.\\n        *   **Curiosity in Shared Boundaries:** Novelty can exist at the boundaries between fragments. How does F&R handle the \"seams\" of its decomposition?\\n\\n#### 3. Strengths of the F&R Framework\\n\\n1.  **Hierarchical Scalability:** Inherently designed for large environments by breaking them into manageable sub-problems.\\n2.  **Efficient Re-exploration:** \"Recall\" mechanisms minimize redundant exploration, leading to faster learning and higher coverage rates in multi-episode or long-term tasks.\\n3.  **Targeted Intrinsic Motivation:** Enables a more focused and effective application of curiosity-driven exploration, potentially mitigating issues like \"noisy TV\" by scoping novelty.\\n4.  **Modular Design:** Allows for different RL algorithms or SLAM techniques to be applied within fragments, offering flexibility.\\n5.  **Interpretability:** Fragmentation can lead to more interpretable policies or skills associated with specific regions of the environment.\\n6.  **Robustness to Sparse Rewards:** By defining exploration goals (e.g., complete a fragment) as intrinsic rewards, it can navigate environments with sparse extrinsic rewards more effectively.\\n\\n#### 4. Weaknesses and Open Questions\\n\\n1.  **Complexity of Implementation:** The framework is conceptually elegant but could be complex to implement, requiring robust mechanisms for:\\n    *   **Dynamic Fragmentation:** How are fragments defined and updated online? Is it based on topological features, semantic cues, or novelty gradients?\\n    *   **Fragment Transition:** How does the high-level policy efficiently select the next fragment and ensure smooth transitions between them?\\n    *   **Information Sharing/Recall:** What specific information is stored for each fragment, and how is it efficiently retrieved and integrated into the current policy?\\n2.  **Computational Overhead:** Fragmentation (e.g., graph partitioning), memory management for recall, and hierarchical planning can introduce significant computational costs.\\n3.  **Generalization across Fragments:** If specific policies are learned per fragment, how well do they generalize to *similar but unseen* fragments? Is there a meta-learning component or a shared policy backbone?\\n4.  **\"Stitching\" Problem:** Ensuring global consistency and seamless navigation when transitioning between fragment-specific local maps or policies can be challenging. Loop closure across fragments, for instance, needs careful consideration.\\n5.  **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** The performance might be sensitive to parameters related to fragmentation granularity, recall thresholds, and the balance between intra- and inter-fragment exploration.\\n\\n#### 5. Experimental Results (Anticipated)\\n\\nTo robustly demonstrate F&R\\'s effectiveness, the experimental results should show:\\n\\n*   **Superior Exploration Efficiency:** Significantly fewer steps/time to achieve a certain coverage percentage or visit a specific number of unique states compared to strong baselines (e.g., frontier-based, RND, ICM, HRL baselines like options or skills).\\n*   **Performance in Sparse Reward Settings:** Demonstrate higher task success rates in environments where external rewards are very rare, highlighting the benefit of the intrinsic motivation provided by F&R.\\n*   **Scalability Demonstration:** Experiments in increasingly larger and more complex environments (e.g., multi-room buildings, procedural generation) where other methods falter due to computational or exploration issues.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Clear ablation studies showing the individual contributions of the \"fragmentation\" and \"recall\" components, and how they synergize.\\n*   **Qualitative Visualization:** Visualizations of how fragments are formed, how policies are recalled, and the agent\\'s exploration paths, to intuitively demonstrate the mechanism.\\n*   **Map Quality Metrics (if SLAM is central):** If F&R contributes to SLAM accuracy, metrics like ATE (Absolute Trajectory Error) or RPE (Relative Pose Error) should be presented.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe Fragmentation-and-Recall framework represents a promising advancement in exploration for integrated SLAM and RL systems. Its strength lies in its intelligent decomposition of the environment and the principled reuse of learned knowledge, addressing key challenges of scalability and redundant exploration. While the specific implementation details will dictate its practical success and mitigate potential computational and generalization pitfalls, the core conceptual framework offers a compelling direction for building more autonomous and efficient intelligent agents capable of operating in truly large-scale, complex, and unknown environments. If the framework can robustly and adaptively fragment the environment and efficiently recall relevant knowledge, it could significantly push the state-of-the-art in both spatial exploration and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.479801}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'This analysis scrutinizes the memory efficiency claims of FarMap and FarCuriosity based on the provided (implied) experimental results and comparisons with various baselines.\\n\\n**General Observations on Memory Efficiency Claims:**\\n\\nThe core claim for both FarMap and FarCuriosity seems to be that they offer competitive or superior memory efficiency compared to their traditional counterparts, especially for large datasets, while maintaining good performance and providing unique features (like no false positives for FarCuriosity). The underlying mechanism for this efficiency likely stems from their \"far\" architecture, implying compact, possibly contiguous, memory allocation and reduced per-element overhead compared to pointer-heavy tree structures or highly fragmented hash tables.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. FarMap Memory Efficiency Analysis**\\n\\n**Claims:**\\nThe paper claims FarMap is more memory efficient than `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`, and competitive with or better than other high-performance alternatives like `judy_map`, `boost::container::flat_map`, and various modern hash maps (e.g., `robin_map`, `google::dense_hash_map`). This efficiency is attributed to its \"compact representation\" and \"minimal per-node overhead.\"\\n\\n**Supporting Evidence (Hypothetical Data from Tables/Figures):**\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `std::map` (e.g., Table 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** FarMap is almost universally more memory efficient than `std::map`. `std::map` (typically a Red-Black Tree) has significant per-node overhead (pointers for parent, left, right children, color bit, plus key and value storage).\\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is highly valid. If the results show FarMap using, for example, 2-3x less memory than `std::map` for large N, it\\'s consistent with known `std::map` overheads.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `std::unordered_map` (e.g., Table 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** FarMap often uses less memory than `std::unordered_map`. `std::unordered_map` has overhead from its bucket array (which can be sparse, especially with default load factors) and individual node allocations (for collision chains), plus the hash value itself.\\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is generally valid. If `std::unordered_map` shows higher memory usage, especially at lower load factors or for very specific key distributions, FarMap\\'s page-based, contiguous allocation strategy would naturally lead to better memory packing.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `judy_map` (e.g., Table 1 or Figure 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** `judy_map` (Judy Arrays) are known for exceptional memory efficiency, often approaching the theoretical minimum for key-value pairs due to their radix-tree like structure that can pack nodes very tightly. FarMap would face its toughest challenge here.\\n    *   **Validity:** If FarMap shows memory usage close to `judy_map` (e.g., within 10-20% for integer keys), it\\'s a strong testament to its design. If `judy_map` consistently uses less memory, the paper should acknowledge this and pivot to other FarMap advantages (e.g., ease of use, C++ template, performance characteristics). *Specific scrutiny is needed here*: Is FarMap *actually* better, or just \"competitive\"? \"Competitive\" is a weaker claim but still good.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `boost::container::flat_map` (e.g., Table 1 or Figure 1):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** `flat_map` uses `std::vector` internally, making it extremely memory efficient (contiguous storage, no per-node overhead for pointers). However, insertions/deletions are expensive (re-sorting, shifting elements).\\n    *   **Validity:** For read-heavy, write-once scenarios, `flat_map` might be superior in memory. For dynamic maps, FarMap should demonstrate better amortized memory usage as it avoids large reallocations and shifts. The claim needs to be nuanced: FarMap is memory efficient *for dynamic scenarios* compared to `flat_map`.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with other high-performance hash maps (e.g., `robin_map`, `google::dense_hash_map`):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** These hash maps are highly optimized for memory. Robin Hood hashing, for instance, minimizes wasted space due to collisions. Google\\'s dense hash map uses sentinel values for empty/deleted slots but can be very compact.\\n    *   **Validity:** Similar to `judy_map`, FarMap\\'s claim of *superiority* in memory efficiency against these is very ambitious. It\\'s more likely to be \"competitive.\" If FarMap consistently shows lower memory, the mechanism (e.g., how it handles load factor, key-value packing within pages) needs to be very well explained. If it uses slightly more, the benefits (e.g., better worst-case performance, simpler usage, no sentinels) must be highlighted.\\n\\n**Overall Validity for FarMap:**\\nThe claims of FarMap being more memory efficient than `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` are very likely valid and well-supported by the general understanding of these data structures. The claims against highly optimized alternatives like `judy_map` or `robin_map` require closer scrutiny. \"Competitive\" is a more realistic claim than \"superior\" in many cases, especially if FarMap provides other advantages. The paper should explicitly state the *per-element overhead* in bytes for FarMap for common key-value types (e.g., `int, int`) to allow for theoretical comparison.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. FarCuriosity Memory Efficiency Analysis**\\n\\n**Claims:**\\nFarCuriosity is presented as a memory-efficient alternative to `std::set`, `std::unordered_set`, and critically, Bloom filters, for membership testing. The key differentiator from Bloom filters is the guarantee of *no false positives* while still maintaining competitive memory usage.\\n\\n**Supporting Evidence (Hypothetical Data from Tables/Figures):**\\n\\n*   **Comparison with `std::set` and `std::unordered_set` (e.g., Table 2):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** FarCuriosity should be significantly more memory efficient, similar to FarMap vs. `std::map`/`unordered_map`. Sets have similar overheads (tree nodes for `std::set`, hash table and linked list nodes for `std::unordered_set`).\\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is highly valid. If FarCuriosity uses a fraction of the memory of `std::set` or `std::unordered_set`, the results are consistent with expectations.\\n\\n*   **Comparison with Bloom Filters (e.g., Table 3, Figure 2):**\\n    *   **Expected Result:** This is the most crucial and nuanced comparison. Bloom filters are *designed* for probabilistic membership testing with extremely low memory footprints. For a given target False Positive Rate (FPR) and number of elements (N), an optimal Bloom filter can achieve near-minimal memory usage (e.g., 1.44 bits per element for 1% FPR, 9.6 bits per element for 0.0001% FPR).\\n    *   **Validity:**\\n        *   **Claim \"competitive memory usage\":** This claim needs careful qualification. FarCuriosity *cannot* intrinsically beat a well-tuned Bloom filter in terms of *raw bits per element for a given FPR*, because FarCuriosity stores *exact* information (0% FPR), which fundamentally requires more bits than probabilistic information.\\n        *   **How FarCuriosity can be \"competitive\":**\\n            1.  **High-FPR Bloom Filters:** If comparing against Bloom filters configured for *extremely low* FPRs (e.g., 0.000001%), these require a very large number of bits per element. In such extreme cases, FarCuriosity *might* become competitive or even use less memory, as its exact storage overhead could be lower than the very high bit-per-element requirement of the Bloom filter.\\n            2.  **Dynamic Scenarios:** Bloom filters are typically fixed-size. Adding many more elements than initially provisioned means the FPR increases significantly or requires re-hashing into a larger structure. FarCuriosity, being dynamic, would manage its memory adaptively. This is a strong advantage.\\n            3.  **Deletion Capability:** Bloom filters generally do not support deletions easily without introducing false negatives or requiring complex counting Bloom filters (which significantly increase memory). FarCuriosity supports exact deletion.\\n            4.  **Key Size:** If the keys are very large (e.g., long strings), a Bloom filter\\'s memory usage depends only on N and FPR. FarCuriosity\\'s memory usage would depend on the actual storage of these keys. For small keys, Bloom filters usually win easily. For large keys, the relative overheads might shift.\\n            5.  **Practical Implementations:** Some standard Bloom filter implementations might not be optimally tuned or use fixed-size arrays that lead to wasted space if not fully utilized. FarCuriosity might be more efficient than *these specific implementations*.\\n\\n**Overall Validity for FarCuriosity:**\\nThe claims of FarCuriosity being more memory efficient than `std::set` and `std::unordered_set` are robustly valid. The claims against Bloom filters require significant nuance. FarCuriosity offers a compelling value proposition: *exact* membership (no FPR) and dynamic updates/deletions, *while being competitive in memory usage with Bloom filters configured for very low FPRs, or outperforming them in specific dynamic scenarios or with large keys*. The paper should clearly articulate this trade-off rather than implying a blanket superiority in memory over Bloom filters. The presented data should show:\\n*   Memory usage of FarCuriosity.\\n*   Memory usage of Bloom filters at *varying FPRs* (e.g., 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%). This allows readers to see the crossover point where FarCuriosity becomes competitive.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Potential Areas for Improvement / Further Scrutiny:**\\n\\n1.  **Detailed Breakdown of Per-Element Overhead:** Provide a theoretical memory overhead per key-value pair (for FarMap) and per key (for FarCuriosity) for common types (e.g., `int, int` or `std::string, int`). This helps validate the \"minimal overhead\" claim.\\n2.  **Impact of Key/Value Size:** How does memory efficiency scale with varying key and value sizes? A design that\\'s memory efficient for `int, int` might be less so for `std::string, std::vector<double>` if it still allocates fixed-size \"pages\" that become inefficiently utilized.\\n3.  **Load Factor/Density Analysis:** For hash map comparisons, it\\'s important to control for or analyze the impact of load factors. FarMap\\'s internal page utilization could be analogous to a load factor.\\n4.  **Peak vs. Stable Memory:** Are the reported memory figures peak usage during insertions/deletions, or stable state after population? How do reallocations or page splits/merges affect transient memory usage?\\n5.  **Memory Reclamation:** Does FarMap/FarCuriosity efficiently return memory to the OS upon deletion of many elements or clear operations, or does it retain allocated pages/blocks?\\n6.  **Benchmarking Environment Details:** Ensure full disclosure of the OS, compiler, standard library version, and hardware used for benchmarking. This helps reproducibility.\\n7.  **Theoretical Basis for FarCuriosity vs. Bloom Filters:** Dedicate a small section to explicitly discuss why FarCuriosity might be chosen over a Bloom filter, specifically addressing the memory trade-offs (exact vs. probabilistic, static vs. dynamic, deletion, key size impact). A plot showing \"bits per element\" for FarCuriosity vs. Bloom filters at various FPRs would be very insightful.\\n8.  **Edge Cases:** How does FarMap/FarCuriosity perform in terms of memory for very small N? Are there fixed overheads that make them less efficient than `std::map`/`std::set` for a handful of elements? (Often true for complex data structures).\\n\\nBy addressing these points and providing detailed, multi-faceted experimental results, the paper can significantly strengthen its memory efficiency claims and provide a clearer picture of when FarMap and FarCuriosity are the optimal choices.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.47883785}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where an agent\\'s ability to retain previously acquired knowledge or skills is severely impaired when it learns new information, especially in sequential or non-stationary environments. In essence, the neural network weights optimized for a new task or environment configuration overwrite the weights critical for past tasks, leading to a dramatic drop in performance on what was previously mastered.\\n\\n**FarCuriosity** emerges as a promising approach to mitigate this issue, particularly in heterogeneous environments \u2013 settings characterized by diverse, often non-stationary, and structurally distinct sub-tasks or phases. The core idea behind FarCuriosity is to design an intrinsic motivation signal that encourages exploration not just for immediate novelty, but for learning representations and policies that are robust, generalizable, and less prone to being overwritten.\\n\\n### FarCuriosity\\'s Mechanism and Effectiveness in Mitigating CF\\n\\nWhile the exact specifics of \"FarCuriosity\" can vary based on its implementation, its name suggests a focus on:\\n\\n1.  **Distal or Long-Term Novelty/Uncertainty:** Unlike traditional curiosity methods (e.g., prediction error on immediate next state) that can suffer from the \"noisy TV\" problem (getting stuck on unpredictable but uninformative observations), \"FarCuriosity\" likely seeks out states or experiences that significantly reduce long-term predictive uncertainty, lead to a greater understanding of the environment\\'s causal structure, or reveal fundamentally new patterns. This could involve:\\n    *   **Disagreement-based Curiosity:** Using an ensemble of predictive models (e.g., next-state predictors, feature predictors) and measuring the divergence in their predictions. High disagreement signifies areas where the models collectively lack confidence, thus indicating valuable exploration targets. When the environment shifts (heterogeneity), the ensemble\\'s disagreement will naturally spike, driving the agent to re-explore and adapt.\\n    *   **Feature Novelty/Diversity:** Encouraging the agent to discover states that yield distinct or novel features in a learned representation space, rather than just raw pixel novelty. This promotes learning diverse representations that are less likely to be entirely subsumed by new experiences.\\n    *   **Information Gain (over longer horizons):** Prioritizing exploration that maximally reduces uncertainty about the environment\\'s dynamics or rewards over a future trajectory, not just the very next step.\\n\\n2.  **Addressing Heterogeneity:** In heterogeneous environments, the dynamics, optimal policies, or reward structures can change dramatically. FarCuriosity tackles CF here by:\\n    *   **Promoting Robust Representations:** By encouraging exploration that leads to a *diverse* set of learned features, the agent\\'s internal models are less brittle. If one set of features becomes irrelevant in a new sub-environment, others might still be useful or quickly adaptable. An ensemble, by its nature, maintains multiple \"perspectives\" on the environment.\\n    *   **Adaptive Exploration:** When the environment shifts, the intrinsic reward signal generated by FarCuriosity (e.g., high model disagreement) will naturally increase in the newly uncertain regions. This guides the agent to explore and re-learn specifically what is *new* without forgetting the *old* as much. The agent is intrinsically motivated to reduce this \"far\" uncertainty.\\n    *   **Preventing Over-Specialization:** Standard RL, especially with sparse rewards, can lead to highly specialized policies that perfectly solve one task but catastrophically fail on another due to overfitting. FarCuriosity\\'s drive for broader understanding and uncertainty reduction naturally counteracts this, leading to more generalized and adaptable policies.\\n\\n### Analysis of Experimental Results and Performance Gains\\n\\nAssuming typical experimental setups for evaluating such an approach in heterogeneous environments (e.g., multiple mazes with changing textures/goals, robots with varying physics parameters, Atari games with concept shifts):\\n\\n*   **Setup:** Experiments would likely compare FarCuriosity against:\\n    *   Vanilla RL (PPO, A2C, etc.)\\n    *   RL with standard intrinsic curiosity (e.g., ICM, RND)\\n    *   Potentially, RL with continual learning techniques (e.g., EWC, SI, Rehearsal), though FarCuriosity is an intrinsic motivation approach, not a direct memory preservation technique.\\n*   **Key Metrics:**\\n    *   **Cumulative Reward:** FarCuriosity would typically achieve higher average cumulative rewards over the entire training process in heterogeneous environments.\\n    *   **Success Rate on Sequential Tasks:** Crucially, it would show significantly higher success rates on *previously mastered* tasks/environment configurations, even after learning new ones. This directly quantifies reduced catastrophic forgetting.\\n    *   **Learning Efficiency:** Faster adaptation to new environmental phases, indicating better transfer of knowledge and reduced need for extensive re-learning.\\n    *   **Policy Robustness:** Lower variance in performance across different environmental instances or during transitions, suggesting more stable and adaptable policies.\\n    *   **Exploration Efficiency:** Metrics showing more diverse and purposeful exploration, avoiding repetitive or uninformative exploration loops (\"noisy TV\").\\n\\n**Expected Performance Gains:**\\n\\n1.  **Reduced Forgetting (Primary Benefit):** FarCuriosity would demonstrate a substantial quantitative reduction in performance degradation on old tasks. For instance, while a vanilla agent might drop from 90% success on Task A to 10% after learning Task B, a FarCuriosity agent might only drop to 70-80%, and quickly recover.\\n2.  **Improved Generalization:** The agent learns more transferable skills and representations, leading to better zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to novel, but related, environmental configurations not seen during training.\\n3.  **Enhanced Sample Efficiency:** By guiding exploration to genuinely informative regions (where \"far\" uncertainty is high), the agent requires fewer interactions with the environment to achieve high performance across diverse settings. This is particularly valuable in real-world applications where data collection is expensive.\\n4.  **Robustness to Non-Stationarity:** FarCuriosity\\'s inherent mechanism of detecting and exploring uncertain areas makes it inherently more robust to the shifting dynamics common in heterogeneous environments, preventing the agent from getting \"stuck\" in a sub-optimal policy for a phase that no longer exists.\\n5.  **Qualitative Exploration:** Visualizations of visited states or learned representations might show that FarCuriosity leads to a more uniform and comprehensive exploration of the state space, particularly focusing on transition points or novel structures, rather than getting trapped in trivial prediction errors.\\n\\n### Limitations of FarCuriosity\\n\\nDespite its benefits, FarCuriosity, like any approach, has limitations:\\n\\n1.  **Computational Overhead:** Methods relying on ensembles (for disagreement-based curiosity) are inherently more computationally expensive in terms of training time and memory, as multiple models need to be maintained and queried.\\n2.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The balance between extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, the number of ensemble members, and the specific mechanism for calculating \"far\" uncertainty all introduce new hyperparameters that can be difficult to tune across diverse environments.\\n3.  **Scalability to High-Dimensional Inputs:** While feature learning can help, handling very high-dimensional raw observations (e.g., raw pixel images in complex 3D worlds) can still make learning robust predictive models for curiosity challenging.\\n4.  **Defining \"Far\" Uncertainty:** The exact definition of \"far\" or \"meaningful\" uncertainty is crucial. A poorly designed intrinsic reward could still lead to issues (e.g., being attracted to truly random noise that provides no learnable pattern).\\n5.  **Limited Applicability to Extreme Shifts:** While it mitigates, it might not entirely eliminate CF in scenarios with *extreme* or adversarial environmental shifts where previously learned representations become entirely irrelevant and new ones must be built from scratch. It assumes some underlying continuity or learnable structure across heterogeneity.\\n6.  **Interference with Extrinsic Reward:** In environments with very sparse and delayed extrinsic rewards, a strong intrinsic motivation signal could sometimes distract the agent from finding the actual task rewards if not properly balanced.\\n\\n### Future Directions\\n\\n1.  **Adaptive Ensemble Sizing/Weighting:** Developing mechanisms to dynamically adjust the size or weight of ensemble members based on their performance or relevance to the current environmental phase, reducing computational cost while maintaining diversity.\\n2.  **Combination with Continual Learning Techniques:** Integrating FarCuriosity with architectural (e.g., progressive networks, modularity), regularization (e.g., EWC, SI), or replay-based (e.g., prioritized experience replay with diverse memories) continual learning methods. FarCuriosity focuses on *exploration for robustness*, while CL techniques focus on *memory preservation*. The synergy could be powerful.\\n3.  **Meta-Learning for Intrinsic Rewards:** Using meta-learning to learn how to generate optimal intrinsic curiosity signals, reducing hyperparameter tuning and potentially leading to more generalizable intrinsic motivation.\\n4.  **Hierarchical FarCuriosity:** Applying FarCuriosity at different levels of abstraction in hierarchical RL, where low-level policies explore for immediate novelties, and high-level policies explore for strategic, long-term uncertainties.\\n5.  **Real-World Transfer:** Testing FarCuriosity in real-world robotic tasks or dynamic simulations where environments are inherently heterogeneous and non-stationary, pushing beyond academic benchmarks.\\n6.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** Further theoretical work to formally prove the benefits of such \"far\" uncertainty over traditional prediction errors in terms of exploration completeness, sample efficiency, and catastrophic forgetting reduction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, FarCuriosity represents a significant step forward in building more robust and adaptable RL agents, particularly in the challenging domain of heterogeneous environments.
