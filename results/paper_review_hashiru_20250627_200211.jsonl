The paper title is: Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Mammalian sense of smell constantly provides information about the composition of the volatile chemical environment and is able to discriminate thousands of different molecules. At the atomic scale, volatile organic compounds are recognized by specific interactions with protein receptors expressed at the surface of olfactory neurons (Buck & Axel, 1991). Mammalian epithelium expresses hundreds of different olfactory receptors (ORs), belonging to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which constitute the largest known multigene family (Niimura & Nei, 2003). The recognition of odorants by ORs is based on the complementarity of structures and hydrophobic or van der Waals interactions which leads to low molecular affinity (Katada et al., 2005). With the exception of a few conserved amino acids, the sequences of ORs show little identity. In particular, the ligand-binding pocket has hypervariable residues (Pilpel & Lancet, 1999) that are relatively well conserved between orthologs. This property gives ORs the ability to bind a wide variety of molecules that differ in structure, size, or chemical properties. The recognition of odorants is done according to the combinatorial code of activation (Malnic et al., 1999). Each odorant is recognized by several ORs, whereas an individual OR can bind several odorants with distinct affinities and specificities (Zhao et al., 1998). This combinatorial code is sensitive to subtle modifications, so the response of a single receptor can have a major influence on the smell perception. Even a small sequence modification could affect odorant responsiveness (Keller et al., 2007; Mainland et al., 2014). On the other hand, structural and functional modifications of an odorant can abolish the interaction with a specific receptor (Katada et al., 2005), and even lead to a different smell perception (Sell, 2006). So far the combinatorial code of the majority of odorants remains unknown. Identifying the recognition spectrum of each OR is therefore essential to decipher the mechanisms of the olfactory system and subsequently build models capable of cracking the combinatorial code of activation. There is only a limited number of models designed to match ligands and ORs. Namely Kowalewski & Ray (2020) follow a molecule-oriented approach and predict agonists for a subset of 34 ORs (24 wild types and 10 variants) by representing molecules via fingerprints (Morgan, 1965; Klekota & Roth, 2008) and building an individual SVM model for each OR. On the other hand, Cong et al. (2022) focus on receptors and address a more complex problem of predicting active ORs for 4 given molecules. In their Random forest model, each amino acid of the protein sequence is described by 3 physico-chemical properties and the molecules by a subset of Dragon descriptors (Mauri et al., 2006). In a more general approach, Gupta et al. (2021) consider any OR-molecule pair and use BiLSTM (Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005) to predict the binding of a molecule, represented by SMILES string, to an OR sequence. In contrast, in this work we use a graph and a [CLS] token embedding from protBERT (Elnaggar et al., 2021) to represent molecules and receptors, respectively. We abstract receptor-molecule binding as the injection of a molecule into a protein specific environment. This is achieved by using molecular topology as a layout for the message passing process and copying the protein representation to each node of the molecular graph. As a result, the redundancy of protein information enables a local processing of the \"protein environment\" and achieves better performance than a common strategy of processing the receptor and the molecule in parallel. This abstraction leads to a graph with the number of nodes depending only on the size of the molecule. Molecules with flexible moieties can undergo conformational changes upon binding to maximize interactions with the receptor binding cavity. This structural adaptation modifies the strength of internal non-bonded forces. However, standard GNN architectures are restricted to the molecular topology. Thus, we have built a tailored GNN architecture combining local interaction of bonded atoms, as done by standard GNNs, with multi-head attention, giving the model the ability to incorporate interactions between any pair of atoms. We show that this architecture outperforms other baselines as well as previous work on olfactory receptor-molecule activation prediction. Finally, we found a relationship between human odor perception and model predictions, strengthening the biological relevance of the model. The results for humans are in full agreement with the experimental work done by Nara et al. (2011). By analyzing the predictions for human ORs, we observe that the combinatorial codes exhibit large diversity. The OR repertoire contains mostly narrow receptors with several broadly-tuned ones. The results also highlight the existence of odor-specific receptors, but most odors are coded in a complex activation pattern. 2 PRELIMINARIES:  2.1 PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODELS: Recently, protein language models emerged as unsupervised structure learners (Rao et al., 2021b; Vig et al., 2021; Rives et al., 2021), allowing to extract abstract vector representations of proteins. As in natural language processing (NLP), large models with millions of parameters (e.g BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)) are trained on vast databases of amino acid sequences (Steinegger et al., 2019; Steinegger & S\u00f6ding, 2018; UniProt Consortium, 2019; Suzek et al., 2007). In (Rao et al., 2019) various natural language processing models were trained and evaluated on a set of different structurally relevant tasks. Elnaggar et al. (2021) went further and trained a list of powerful NLP models ranging from 200M to 11B parameters. Recently proposed MSA Transformer (Rao et al., 2021a) exploits evolutionary relationships by using Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) as input rather than a single protein sequence at a time. AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2021) extends the idea of using MSA and combines it with an experimentally obtained protein template in an end-to-end model trained on supervised structure prediction. 2.2 GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS: In recent years, graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2018; Battaglia et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2017; Kipf & Welling, 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017) have grown rapidly in popularity and received considerable attention in various domains such as drug design (Torng & Altman, 2019), physics (Shlomi et al., 2021), and chemistry (Gilmer et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Gasteiger et al., 2020b;a). Chemistry is a particularly promising field for GNN applications since a molecule can be naturally represented as a graph G = {V, E}, where V is the set of nodes (atoms) and E the set of edges (bonds). Each node v \u2208 V and each edge (u, v) \u2208 E in G have an initial vector of features, xv and eu,v , respectively. These feature vectors contain information about atom/edge properties such as atomic number, atomic weight, or bond type. 3 MODEL: To tackle the problem of receptor-molecule activation prediction we take a proteo-chemometric approach (Qiu et al., 2017) where the model estimates the probability P (m, r) that a given molecule m activates a given receptor r. The input to the model is the amino acid sequence of the receptor on one side and the molecular graph on the other side. See Fig. 1 (A) for the model outline. Protein sequence representation is obtained using protBERT (Elnaggar et al., 2021) pretrained on a dataset with 217M protein sequences (Suzek et al., 2007). Olfactory receptors are biopolymers of around 300 amino acids and modeling each amino acid explicitly is computationally demanding. To keep the costs relatively low, we take the advantage of the BERT\u2019s classification token ([CLS]) (Devlin et al., 2019) which aggregates information about an entire protein sequence. This way we model amino acids implicitly as they contribute to the [CLS] token embedding, and at the same time, the sequence representation is reduced from roughly 300 \u00d7 d to only d. We concatenate the [CLS] token embedding from the last 5 layers of protBERT and use this vector as the receptor input. A molecule is represented as a graph G with node and edge features in Tab. 5. Note that the representation relies solely on the molecular topology and does not take into account spatial characteristics. The model architecture itself was designed by observing several inductive biases which emerge in molecule-receptor interactions: Locality. The binding between a receptor and a molecule relies on subtle interactions between the binding groups of both protagonists. In particular, molecules contain functional groups that are crucial for forming intermolecular bonds with the receptor. Since we use an aggregated sequence representation, and thus do not explicitly model interactions between amino acids and atoms in the molecule, we emulate this \"locality\" by copying the receptor embedding to each node of the molecular graph (Fig. 1 (a)). This way the sequence representation is part of the node embedding and can be locally changed based on the connectivity and neighborhood properties of each node. Non-bonded interactions. In addition to bonded interactions, atoms in the same molecule interact with each other via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To account for these, we use the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which allows a flow of information between any pair of atoms (Fig. 1 (b)). This is particularly relevant for flexible molecules where two distant atoms in the topology could be close in the conformation. Such approach also inherently takes into account interactions between multiple molecules and thus allows for modeling mixtures. Receptor-molecule complex. When a molecule binds to a receptor, the two form a stable complex that can be considered as a single entity. To accommodate this observation, we combine the molecule and receptor inputs early in the model pipeline rather than mixing them at a late stage to facilitate the flow of information between them throughout the model. Combining the above observations we propose the model architecture in Fig. 1. Based on the locality and receptor-molecule complex observations, we inject receptor embedding into the molecular graph as additional node features, and we use the molecular topology as a layout for the message passing process (Fig. 1 (a)). This approach reduces the biological problem of protein-molecule interaction to a small-scale graph-level binary classification where a molecule is injected into a receptor environment. In this formulation, the size of the graph depends solely on the number of atoms in the molecule. Given the above abstraction, any standard GNN architecture might be applied to predict a moleculereceptor binding event. However, standard models do not allow for information to pass outside of the graph topology. To account for non-bonded interactions, we combine the local processing done by a GNN with the multi-head attention. To enhance the expressive power of the network, we use two separate identical GNNs for queries and keys/values. Each row in the queries and keys/values is a node embedding resulting from the corresponding GNN (Fig. 1 (b)). Then we use the multi-head attention followed by layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) and feed forward network (Vaswani et al., 2017). A similar approach was taken in (Rong et al., 2020), but our methodologies differ. Rong et al. (2020) replace linear transformations in the multi-head attention with graph neural networks and thus have 3 \u2217 |heads| \u2217 |layers| different message passing steps. Instead, we use two GNNs to construct queries and keys/values, and the standard multi-head attention with linear transformations, so our model has 2 \u2217N \u2217 |layers| steps, where N is the number of graph processing blocks. The final model simply consists of N blocks followed by an ECC layer (Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017) and an attention pooling as the graph to vector operation, and a dense layer for final output. We chose to keep the GNNs architecture simple since there is a subsequent processing. We use a dense layer followed by ReLU to construct messages from concatenated sender, receiver and edge features, sum aggregation and a GRU cell (Cho et al., 2014) to update nodes1. 3.1 TRAINING: To avoid overfitting we adopt similar strategy as in (Rong et al., 2020). During training, a random number of message passing steps T is sampled from a truncated normal distribution N(\u00b5, \u03c3, a, b) in each iteration of gradient descent. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with the learning rate schedule from (Vaswani et al., 2017) and in all experiments we train the model for 10 000 epochs. In the first 8000 epochs we train on graphs with up to 32 nodes and 64 edges, and then we switch to the full dataset during the remaining 2000 epochs. For evaluation and prediction, we set the number of message passing steps to \u00b5. In our experiments, we set \u00b5 = 6, \u03c3 = 1 and the truncation interval between a = 3 and b = 9. 4 DATA: Only a limited amount of organized and curated data on OR-molecule pairs is available (Cong et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2011). To fill this gap, we have gathered and curated a new 1Model source code is available here: https://github.com/AnonymousICLR2023/3007_ matching_receptor_to_odorant dataset of 46 450 unique OR-molecule pairs from the literature, tripling the size of the currently largest database of this kind (Cong et al., 2022). The data puts together experiments for 1237 unique sequences for 11 mammalian species with additional information on experimental procedure and varying data quality. See Supplementary material G for further details about the dataset. Mammalian olfaction is sensitive to chirality and two enantiomers can have different smell perception. However, 22% of the gathered data are actually pairs of an OR and a mixture of enantiomers. To address this, we consider two modeling strategies for the mixtures of enantiomers: a \"mixture\" approach where we exploit the ability of our proposed model to work with mixtures and a \"single\" approach where a mixture of enantiomers is treated implicitly, by changing the chiral property of the nodes. See further details in sections B and E.1. In addition, there are several biases in the data that need to be addressed during training. Label noise coming from high-throughput screening, class imbalance, and the combinatorial nature of the task. In response, we construct sample weights for each sub-problem and use a weighted binary cross entropy loss where the final weights are the product of the partial weights. Further details for weights construction are discussed in Supplementary material C. 4.1 TEST SET: Because of the varying data quality, special attention needs to be paid to the test set construction. In order to have high confidence in the results we select only pairs from the highest quality dose-response data for the test set. Unless otherwise stated, in each cross-validation run in the experiments, we randomly select 30% of the dose-response samples for the test set. We run 5 cross-validation runs for all experiments. 5 EXPERIMENTS: We performed a series of experiments on the newly gathered dataset of OR-molecule pairs. In 5.1 we compare our proposed architecture with other GNNs and perform ablation studies on the inductive biases. We explore the generalization of the model to unseen receptors and molecules in Section 5.2, and in 5.3 we compare our approach with the previous studies of OR-molecule interactions. Due to the imbalance nature of molecule-protein activations, we use Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) as the main metric. We also report others for comparison with previous work. 5.1 MODEL ABLATIONS: GNN architecture We compare our model with 3 standard GNN models and we experiment with 2 additional modifications of our approach. We use ECC (Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017), GGNN (Li et al., 2015) and GAT (Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2017) as standard baselines. In the first ablation, we consider dropping the non-bonded interactions observation and we replace Q-MPNN, KV-MPNN and the multi-head attention in Fig. 1 (b) with a GAT layer (Transformer GAT in Tab. 1). This way we do not allow direct interactions between all pairs of atoms, but we restrict the model solely to the topology of the molecule. The second ablation is in the opposite direction. We drop the molecular topology and use only the multi-head attention by setting Q-MPNN and KV-MPNN to identity functions. Note that this reduces to the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) encoder model. As can be observed in the results in Tab. 1, our model outperforms the standard baselines by a large margin of 0.119 (0.129 with the \"mixture\" approach) and also proves to be the best among the ablations. The ECC model failed to converge at all and its performance is poor compared to the others. The best from the baseline models is GAT with MCC 0.476, closely followed by GGNN. Compared to simple GAT, the performance increases in the first ablation when we combine the GAT layer with feed-forward network, normalization, and residual connections. Interestingly, ignoring the molecular topology and using Transformer yields better performance than any of the baseline GNNs or than Tranformer GAT. This is surprising because Transformer has no access to the topology of the molecule and this suggests that the multi-head attention component is crucial for performance. However, combining both the multi-head attention and GNN together works the best (our model), implying that both the molecular topology and pairwise interactions are needed. Mixing It is not evident at which point in the model the protein and molecule inputs should be mixed. We argue that the molecule and the receptor create a complex, and since they constantly interact with each other, the information should be mixed in an early stage of the processing. We test this hypothesis against a more common strategy (Du et al., 2022) of late mixing of protein and molecule information. We compare our model with a standard strategy of processing molecular information separately via a GNN and then mixing the molecular embedding with the protein representation. This breaks the locality and receptor-molecule complex observations. We consider two mixing strategies: concatenation and attention. Concatenation is the most standard one and in this case the molecule is processed without the protein information and the resulting embedding from the graph to vector operation is concatenated to the protein [CLS] token. This concatenated vector is then the input to a dense network. The second strategy is to use the resulting molecule embedding as keys/values in the multi-head attention and the [CLS] representation of the protein as a query. This is followed by layer normalization and feed-forward network like in the Transformer block. We use the proposed blocks in Fig. 1 (b) to generate molecular embedding. The results for mixing ablation are summarized in Tab. 2. Despite the redundancy of the protein representation in the nodes, our approach outperforms other mixing strategies. This suggests that by incorporating the locality and receptor-molecule complex inductive biases, the model can learn to exploit the dependencies between various molecular binding groups and the receptor. 5.2 GENERALIZATION: An important and perhaps the most interesting experiment we conduct is to test the generalization of the model. 43% of mammalian ORs have no identified active compound, and only 206 out of 385 human ORs have a known responsive molecule. Therefore, the prediction of active compounds for so-called orphan receptors (i.e. deorphanization task) remains a great challenge. Moreover, among 6496 identified odorant molecules (Castro et al., 2022), 493 have been tested so far, and finally only 332 of them are known to induce an OR response. Thus, it is of major interest to identify new active molecules for ORs (i.e. expanding chemical space). Deorphanization. Model generalization to unseen ORs is tested in two scenarios. In the first one (called random in Tab. 3), several ORs are randomly chosen to be exclusively included in the test set and all their occurrences are removed from the training set. This scenario appears more realistic because deorphanized ORs are found in each OR family. The second scenario, more complex, is defined by selecting entire clusters of receptors for the test set. The ORs are clustered according to their sequence similarity, and then all dose-response pairs for all receptors in 9 randomly picked clusters are placed in the test set. In this complex case, the model has to extrapolate to proteins with dissimilar sequences. In both scenarios, we also experiment with keeping negative primary and secondary screening pairs for the selected receptors (OR-keep in Tab. 3). Expanding chemical space. Identifying new active compounds for olfactory receptors remains challenging. To test the ability of the model to generalize to new molecules, we follow the same strategy as for \"deorphanization\" (Molecules in Tab. 3). We either randomly select molecules and put all their occurrences to the test set, or we choose several clusters based on Tanimoto coefficient (i.e. structural similarity). See Section D for the full description of the experimental setup. Generalization results. The results of the generalization experiments are summarized in Tab. 3. In the first random scenario, mainly recall is affected compared to an i.i.d. split and precision undergoes minor changes by 2-5%. Keeping non-active molecules has small impact and leads to a more conservative model with higher precision and lower recall. It appears that the model generalizes poorly to entirely new family of receptors (Tab. 3, cluster task). This is due to the fact that subtle variations in the amino acids sequence of ORs can utterly alter its recognition profile (de March et al., 2018; Trimmer et al., 2019). Interestingly, even though overall MCC is low for the cluster scenario, the precision is still maintained at a relatively high level with a difference of 11-15% compared to the i.i.d. split. From the molecule perspective, the model can generalize well to new compounds that have similar distribution to the training set. As expected, the performance decreases on an entirely unseen group of molecules, yet the model still keeps the precision of 54.4%, only 14% lower than in the i.i.d. case. The recall on the other hand deteriorates by half. This suggests that the model is conservative and reluctant to predict many responsive pairs, which can be an advantage for in vitro experiments. Although some responsive pairs are missed as a result of lower recall, the predictions keep similar reliability across scenarios, and thus the number of laboratory hits would remain stable. 5.3 COMPARISON WITH OR-MOLECULE MODELS: We compare our work with Kowalewski & Ray (2020), Cong et al. (2022), and Gupta et al. (2021). When analyzing the results, the generality of the approaches needs to be taken into account. As can be seen in Tab. 4, Kowalewski & Ray (2020) perform slightly better in terms of AUROC than others, but this approach is suitable only for 32 ORs that have enough identified ligands. On the other hand, Cong et al. (2022) took a more general approach by fitting a single model to data for 10 molecules (4 targets and 6 similar compounds). It is applicable to a variety of ORs, but only for compounds structurally close to the 4 targets. Even though Cong et al. (2022) consider an easier setting with a limited number of molecules, our approach outperforms it by a large margin. Finally, our model and the BiLSTM model of Gupta et al. (2021) consider any given molecule-receptor pairs. However, we outperform Gupta et al. (2021) in all the metrics and more than twice the precision. 6 AGREEMENT WITH ODOR PERCEPTION: The combinatorial nature of olfaction was first hypothesized in 1973 by Polak (1973) and further confirmed by the discovery of ORs by Buck & Axel (1991). Malnic et al. (1999) demonstrated that different odorants are recognized by different subsets of ORs. In this section, we analyze the link between our model predictions and odor perception of odorant molecules. We evaluate the concordance between our model and the olfactory perception as follows: given a large dataset of known odorants (Castro et al., 2022), we construct an abstract smell characteristic of a molecule by taking an embedding of a GNN-based odor prediction model (Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2019).This model was recently shown to outperform a median panelist in odor description task, and its embedding can capture perceptual similarity of molecules (Lee et al., 2022). The compounds are then clustered based on their odor embedding. For each cluster we define an agreement score as the \u03b1-quantile of the distribution of median l1 distances between the combinatorial codes within the cluster2. In other words, let Aki , A k j \u2208 {0, 1}385 be the combinatorial codes for two molecules in cluster k. Then the agreement score Qk for cluster k is given by Qk(\u03b1) = inf q {\u2200i : P (m\u0302{\u2225Aki \u2212Akj \u22251} \u2264 q) > \u03b1} (1) where m\u0302 denotes the median through j. When considering \u03b1 percent of the most consistent codes, Qk(\u03b1) represents the largest deviation of OR responses in cluster k. We report several values of \u03b1 due to the known ambiguity of odor descriptors which depend on several cultural and personal factors of the panelists such as varying verbal expressions, current state and previous experience, or are even affected by OR mutations (Kaeppler & Mueller, 2013). Fig. 2 reports the distribution of Qk(\u03b1) for all clusters k and several levels \u03b1. Most of the clusters have a consistent combinatorial code as illustrated by the density of Qk (Fig. 2), highlighting an agreement between the results of the two independent models: odor prediction and OR activation. For \u03b1 = 75%, more than 60% of all clusters differ by less than 25 ORs and 84% by less than 50. Fig. 4 provides examples of clusters with different \u03b1-quantile values. Although the odor prediction model outperforms a median panelist, it is still prone to error, and this may influence the quality of the clustering and consequently lead to outliers in the clusters, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (b). A previous in vitro study on 125 odorants suggested that molecules recognized by a subset of ORs share the same odor quality (Nara et al., 2011). The consistency of activation patterns observed in the odor clusters allows us to generalize this experimental observation to all known odorants. Nara et al. (2011) found that most ORs are narrowly tuned with the exception of few broadly tuned ORs. Our predictions are consistent with this observation, as our results conclude that the vast majority of ORs have a very narrow recognition spectrum (see Fig. 3). In addition, our model is able to identify specialized receptors for some specific odor families (as an example see Fig. 5). In agreement with Nara et al. (2011), odor is generally encoded in a combination of multiple active receptors and the size of the code varies among odorants. 2There are 205 odor clusters and 385 human ORs. 7 CONCLUSION: In this study, we transfer the biological problem of protein-molecule interaction to a graph-level binary classification. We combine [CLS] token from the protein language model with graph neural networks and multi-head attention to predict active compounds for ORs. We design a tailored GNN architecture by incorporating inductive biases that are observed in receptor-ligand interactions and we demonstrate that this architecture outperforms other baselines and previous works by a large margin. Our results show that [CLS] token contains valuable information to characterize proteins and at the same time lowers computational and memory demands. In addition, by taking into account non-bonded interactions, the model is suited to deal with mixtures of compounds. Although [CLS] token reduces computational costs, it comes with the limitation that one cannot infer the importance of individual amino acids. In the future, we plan to explore the possibility to use MSA-based protein language models to explicitly model amino acids. This may lead to better interpretability with the drawback of higher computational demands. While our predictions are in good agreement with experimental results, our model does not take into account the influence of the concentration on either the perceived odor or the pattern of activated ORs. Recent experiments have shown that inhibition of ORs by odorants is also part of the combinatorial code of odors and, more specifically, that the interaction between odorants in a mixture modulates the activation of ORs relative to that of isolated molecules (Kurian et al., 2021). However, data on OR inhibition remain scarce and do not allow training a model predicting molecular inhibition. To date, 43% of the ORs are still orphans. The prediction of the combinatorial code for all ORs and odorant molecules opens the way to the generalization of experimental results obtained on subsets of ORs or a limited number of odorants. By linking activity patterns to olfactory perception, we confirm that odorants are recognized by a unique subset of ORs and that these subsets are specific to an olfactory characteristic. Finally, we also expect this work to have an impact outside of the olfaction research, as ORs are also expressed in non-nasal tissues and are involved in the regulation of different metabolic functions or found in cancerous cells. Thus, ORs are becoming a promising drug targets, and matching ligand to specific ORs is of major importance. A MODEL DETAILS: In all our experiments, we consider node and bond features in Tab. 5. Molecular graphs were constructed using RDkit (Landrum, 2020) from SMILES obtained from PubChem (Kim et al., 2020). Atomic number, chiral tag and hybridization where embedded in R72, and Bond type and Stereo type in R36. The attention pooling layer in graph to vector operation for graph g is defined as \u03b1 = softmax(Xw) x\u2032 = n\u2211 i=1 \u03b1iXi (2) where X \u2208 Rn\u00d7d is a matrix of node embeddings and w \u2208 Rd\u00d71 are trainable parameters. A.1 TRAINING DETAILS Dropout of 0.1 was applied in each multi-head attention layer and 0.5 just before the output layer. Padding was set to 32 nodes and 64 edges in the first 8000 epochs and 128 and 256, respectively, in the remaining 2000 epochs. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001 and we use 6000 warm-up steps for the scheduler. The model was implemented in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) and FLAX (Heek et al., 2020) and trained on Nvidia V100 SXM2 32GB or Nvidia A100 SXM4 80GB GPUs. B ENANTIOMERS: The olfactory system of primates is sensitive to the chirality of molecules: they can discriminate between enantiomers. By definition, a pair of enantiomers3 are mirror isomers that are not superimposable chemical structures. They have the same atomic composition and they share identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. However, they will have different properties when interacting with a chiral environment (for example, polarized light or the binding site of a protein). Two enantiomers can have a completely different odor, for example R-carvone and S-carvone which smell like caraway and mint, respectively. At the molecular level, these two molecules are recognized by distinct OR subsets. The specific selectivity of ORs for a given enantiomer is at the origin of the differences in perception of chiral molecules. Even if chirality has a high influence on ORs recognition, the distinction between enantiomers is often overlooked in laboratory experiments. As a result, 22% of our gathered data are actually pairs of an OR and a mixture of two (or more) enantiomers. Thus, it appears crucial to inject molecular chirality into our model. Molecular graphs of enantiomers are identical and the only difference is in their chiral centers. These may have clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) chirality and one way of distinguishing them is to put chiral tag property of one chiral center to CW and CCW for the other. Since the molecular graphs are identical, a mixture of enantiomers can be modeled in two ways: as a single graph where chiral centers have \"unknown\" chirality or a mixture of independent molecules. In the latter case, we can exploit the fact that combining GNN with the multi-head attention is capable 3With a slight abuse of notation we refer to both enantiomers and diastereoisomers as enantiomers. of modeling mixtures. Thus, a mixture of enantiomers can be treated as a graph with 2|chiral centers| identical disconnected components that differ only in the chiral tag property of chiral centers. We test both \"single\" and \"mixture\" approaches in Section E.1. Our experiments indicate that the two strategies have similar performance on OR-molecule pairs (Tab. 7). Interestingly, when evaluated on a limited set of complex mixtures (i.e. pairs of OR and mixture containing more than two topologically different compounds), the performance of the model trained in the \"mixture\" approach is higher even though the only mixtures seen during training were the mixtures of enantiomers (Tab. 8). Note that the data on mixtures are limited and further experiments are needed. C SAMPLE WEIGHTS: Data quality. Conducting an experiment with high confidence on responsiveness is costly and time-consuming. The standard procedure for testing molecule-receptor pairs is to first perform a noisy primary screening where many different pairs are tested with just one injection for a single concentration. Then, promising pairs from the primary screening are further tested at several concentrations in a secondary screening. Finally, the pairs that are considered responsive from the secondary screening are tested in the most precise tertiary screening in multiple concentrations and multiple injections per concentration (i.e. dose-response curve). If neglected, varying sample quality could lead to fitting corrupted labels and impairing the model performance and generalization. Therefore, during training we employ a simple strategy to counteract this label noise. For each type of screening, we estimate probability P typec,c\u0302 that the observed label c\u0302 corresponds to the true label c. By treating a dose-response label as true we estimate P\u0302 typec,c\u0302 based on (Mainland et al., 2015), where several pairs were tested in all three types of experiments (Tab. 6). Then we use the diagonal elements as data quality weights for a given type and a given class y wquality(y, type) = P\u0302 typey,y (3) We set the weight for dose-response samples to 1. In the future, a more elaborated label noise treatment could be used (see (Song et al., 2022) for a non-exhaustive list of label noise strategies). Class imbalance. Naturally, most of the molecule-receptor pairs are non-responsive and only 6.2% of the samples in our data are responsive. To account for this class imbalance, we use standard class weights based on the imbalance ratio wclass(y) = { |non\u2212responsive| |responsive| if y = 1 1 if y = 0 (4) Pair imbalance. On top of the class imbalance, some olfactory receptors have been tested with many molecules, whereas others are yet to be explored and were tested only on a few specific compounds (see Fig. 6 for test distributions). We refer to this type of imbalance as pair imbalance and to avoid the bias resulting from the uneven distribution of experiments, we adopt a heuristic weighting scheme to down-weight extensively tested receptors and up-weight less-known ones. For each molecule-receptor pair, we set pair imbalance weight as the logarithm of the harmonic mean wpair(m, r) = ln ( 1 + K 2 ( 1 |M(r)| + 1 |OR(m)| )) (5) where |M(r)| is the number of molecules tested for a given receptor r, |OR(m)| is the number of receptors tested for a given molecule m and K is a scaling constant. In the experiments, we set K = 100. The final sample weight is then given by w(m, r, y, type) = wquality(y, type)wclass(y)wpair(m, r) (6) D EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: D.1 GENERALIZATION Deorphanization To test the generalization to unseen receptors we consider two scenarios. The first one (referred to as random in Tab. 3), where the model predicts active compounds for unseen receptors chosen randomly, and the second, more complex scenario, where entire groups of similar receptors are unseen during the training (cluster in Tab. 3). We test the random scenario by constructing a test set for each cross-validation run in the following way. From pairs tested in dose-response experiments, we filter receptors with at least 3 known active compounds. Then from these filtered receptors we randomly choose 35% and place all dose-response pairs containing these into the test set. We then discard remaining primary and secondary screening pairs containing the selected receptors from the training set (OR in Tab. 3) or we discard only the responsive pairs containing these receptors (OR - keep in Tab. 3). The reasoning behind keeping negative examples is that, in reality, we have access to non-responsive molecules from primary screenings for all human olfactory receptors. Following this procedure, the model has never seen the selected receptors and it needs to extrapolate their molecule-receptor interaction from the remaining proteins. Test set construction in the cluster scenario is similar to the random case, but we do not choose receptors for the test set uniformly. Instead, we cluster receptors based on their sequence similarity and then place dose-response pairs for all receptors from 9 randomly picked clusters into the test set. We then follow the same procedure of discarding either all or only the responsive primary and secondary screening pairs containing these receptors from the training set. This scenario is more demanding than the first setting because the model would need to extrapolate to entirely dissimilar proteins than the ones in the training set. Expanding chemical space. Extrapolation to the unseen molecules is tested by an identical procedure as the deorphanization. The only differences are that we select molecules instead of receptors (25% molecules with at least 2 responsive pairs in random) and in the cluster scenario we cluster molecules based on their Tanimoto coefficient (i.e. structural similarity). We take compounds from 6 randomly selected clusters. In both scenarios, we then discard all other pairs containing the selected compounds from the training set. E ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS: E.1 DATA ABLATIONS Enantiomers. As we argued previously, olfaction is sensitive to the chirality and modeling enantiomers poses a great challenge. Here we test the two approaches to incorporate mixtures of enantiomers and their performance is summarized in Tab. 7. We report two settings where we either test the model on single molecules only (i.e. discarding mixtures of enantiomers from the test set) or on the full test set. We also train a separate model on the training set with mixtures of enantiomers discarded. As can be seen in the results, modeling mixtures of enantiomers explicitly as a mix of independent molecules slightly outperforms the implicit \"single\" approach. In both cases keeping mixtures of enantiomers is beneficial for modeling single molecules. Complex mixtures. Several lab experiments have been performed to test a receptor with a mixture of topologically different compounds. In Tab. 8, we report the performance of our model on a limited dataset of complex mixtures. In particular, we investigate impact of the two strategies for treating mixtures of enantiomers on the performance on complex mixtures. Although the two approaches have identical training sets, the results suggest that the model trained with the \"mixture\" strategy outperforms the \"single\" approach. Data quality weights. Label noise originating from different quality of experiments can bias the model and negatively impact its generalization. To test the label noise treatment we experiment with discarding primary screening data (the most noisy ones, see Tab. 6), with weights presented in Section C, and with ignoring the label noise (i.e. a naive approach). Note that we use only dose-response data for test sets and these are assumed to have no noise. According to the results in Tab. 9, neglecting the label noise lowers the performance. It can be observed that when using weights and when discarding the primary screening data the results are on par. This is due to the fact that most of the corrupted labels are coming from the primary screening (Teb. 6) and so discarding these cures a large portion of the label noise. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that keeping the primary screening data while taking the noise into account could be beneficial for model generalization. Primary screening experiments have relatively low cost and can cover a large number of different pairs. Thus, the model can have access to a large sample of the data distribution.

The paper title is: Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Mammalian sense of smell constantly provides information about the composition of the volatile chemical environment and is able to discriminate thousands of different molecules. At the atomic scale, volatile organic compounds are recognized by specific interactions with protein receptors expressed at the surface of olfactory neurons (Buck & Axel, 1991). Mammalian epithelium expresses hundreds of different olfactory receptors (ORs), belonging to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which constitute the largest known multigene family (Niimura & Nei, 2003). The recognition of odorants by ORs is based on the complementarity of structures and hydrophobic or van der Waals interactions which leads to low molecular affinity (Katada et al., 2005). With the exception of a few conserved amino acids, the sequences of ORs show little identity. In particular, the ligand-binding pocket has hypervariable residues (Pilpel & Lancet, 1999) that are relatively well conserved between orthologs. This property gives ORs the ability to bind a wide variety of molecules that differ in structure, size, or chemical properties. The recognition of odorants is done according to the combinatorial code of activation (Malnic et al., 1999). Each odorant is recognized by several ORs, whereas an individual OR can bind several odorants with distinct affinities and specificities (Zhao et al., 1998). This combinatorial code is sensitive to subtle modifications, so the response of a single receptor can have a major influence on the smell perception. Even a small sequence modification could affect odorant responsiveness (Keller et al., 2007; Mainland et al., 2014). On the other hand, structural and functional modifications of an odorant can abolish the interaction with a specific receptor (Katada et al., 2005), and even lead to a different smell perception (Sell, 2006). So far the combinatorial code of the majority of odorants remains unknown. Identifying the recognition spectrum of each OR is therefore essential to decipher the mechanisms of the olfactory system and subsequently build models capable of cracking the combinatorial code of activation. There is only a limited number of models designed to match ligands and ORs. Namely Kowalewski & Ray (2020) follow a molecule-oriented approach and predict agonists for a subset of 34 ORs (24 wild types and 10 variants) by representing molecules via fingerprints (Morgan, 1965; Klekota & Roth, 2008) and building an individual SVM model for each OR. On the other hand, Cong et al. (2022) focus on receptors and address a more complex problem of predicting active ORs for 4 given molecules. In their Random forest model, each amino acid of the protein sequence is described by 3 physico-chemical properties and the molecules by a subset of Dragon descriptors (Mauri et al., 2006). In a more general approach, Gupta et al. (2021) consider any OR-molecule pair and use BiLSTM (Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005) to predict the binding of a molecule, represented by SMILES string, to an OR sequence. In contrast, in this work we use a graph and a [CLS] token embedding from protBERT (Elnaggar et al., 2021) to represent molecules and receptors, respectively. We abstract receptor-molecule binding as the injection of a molecule into a protein specific environment. This is achieved by using molecular topology as a layout for the message passing process and copying the protein representation to each node of the molecular graph. As a result, the redundancy of protein information enables a local processing of the \"protein environment\" and achieves better performance than a common strategy of processing the receptor and the molecule in parallel. This abstraction leads to a graph with the number of nodes depending only on the size of the molecule. Molecules with flexible moieties can undergo conformational changes upon binding to maximize interactions with the receptor binding cavity. This structural adaptation modifies the strength of internal non-bonded forces. However, standard GNN architectures are restricted to the molecular topology. Thus, we have built a tailored GNN architecture combining local interaction of bonded atoms, as done by standard GNNs, with multi-head attention, giving the model the ability to incorporate interactions between any pair of atoms. We show that this architecture outperforms other baselines as well as previous work on olfactory receptor-molecule activation prediction. Finally, we found a relationship between human odor perception and model predictions, strengthening the biological relevance of the model. The results for humans are in full agreement with the experimental work done by Nara et al. (2011). By analyzing the predictions for human ORs, we observe that the combinatorial codes exhibit large diversity. The OR repertoire contains mostly narrow receptors with several broadly-tuned ones. The results also highlight the existence of odor-specific receptors, but most odors are coded in a complex activation pattern. 2 PRELIMINARIES:  2.1 PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODELS: Recently, protein language models emerged as unsupervised structure learners (Rao et al., 2021b; Vig et al., 2021; Rives et al., 2021), allowing to extract abstract vector representations of proteins. As in natural language processing (NLP), large models with millions of parameters (e.g BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)) are trained on vast databases of amino acid sequences (Steinegger et al., 2019; Steinegger & S\u00f6ding, 2018; UniProt Consortium, 2019; Suzek et al., 2007). In (Rao et al., 2019) various natural language processing models were trained and evaluated on a set of different structurally relevant tasks. Elnaggar et al. (2021) went further and trained a list of powerful NLP models ranging from 200M to 11B parameters. Recently proposed MSA Transformer (Rao et al., 2021a) exploits evolutionary relationships by using Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) as input rather than a single protein sequence at a time. AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2021) extends the idea of using MSA and combines it with an experimentally obtained protein template in an end-to-end model trained on supervised structure prediction. 2.2 GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS: In recent years, graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2018; Battaglia et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017; Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2017; Kipf & Welling, 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017) have grown rapidly in popularity and received considerable attention in various domains such as drug design (Torng & Altman, 2019), physics (Shlomi et al., 2021), and chemistry (Gilmer et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Gasteiger et al., 2020b;a). Chemistry is a particularly promising field for GNN applications since a molecule can be naturally represented as a graph G = {V, E}, where V is the set of nodes (atoms) and E the set of edges (bonds). Each node v \u2208 V and each edge (u, v) \u2208 E in G have an initial vector of features, xv and eu,v , respectively. These feature vectors contain information about atom/edge properties such as atomic number, atomic weight, or bond type. 3 MODEL: To tackle the problem of receptor-molecule activation prediction we take a proteo-chemometric approach (Qiu et al., 2017) where the model estimates the probability P (m, r) that a given molecule m activates a given receptor r. The input to the model is the amino acid sequence of the receptor on one side and the molecular graph on the other side. See Fig. 1 (A) for the model outline. Protein sequence representation is obtained using protBERT (Elnaggar et al., 2021) pretrained on a dataset with 217M protein sequences (Suzek et al., 2007). Olfactory receptors are biopolymers of around 300 amino acids and modeling each amino acid explicitly is computationally demanding. To keep the costs relatively low, we take the advantage of the BERT\u2019s classification token ([CLS]) (Devlin et al., 2019) which aggregates information about an entire protein sequence. This way we model amino acids implicitly as they contribute to the [CLS] token embedding, and at the same time, the sequence representation is reduced from roughly 300 \u00d7 d to only d. We concatenate the [CLS] token embedding from the last 5 layers of protBERT and use this vector as the receptor input. A molecule is represented as a graph G with node and edge features in Tab. 5. Note that the representation relies solely on the molecular topology and does not take into account spatial characteristics. The model architecture itself was designed by observing several inductive biases which emerge in molecule-receptor interactions: Locality. The binding between a receptor and a molecule relies on subtle interactions between the binding groups of both protagonists. In particular, molecules contain functional groups that are crucial for forming intermolecular bonds with the receptor. Since we use an aggregated sequence representation, and thus do not explicitly model interactions between amino acids and atoms in the molecule, we emulate this \"locality\" by copying the receptor embedding to each node of the molecular graph (Fig. 1 (a)). This way the sequence representation is part of the node embedding and can be locally changed based on the connectivity and neighborhood properties of each node. Non-bonded interactions. In addition to bonded interactions, atoms in the same molecule interact with each other via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To account for these, we use the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which allows a flow of information between any pair of atoms (Fig. 1 (b)). This is particularly relevant for flexible molecules where two distant atoms in the topology could be close in the conformation. Such approach also inherently takes into account interactions between multiple molecules and thus allows for modeling mixtures. Receptor-molecule complex. When a molecule binds to a receptor, the two form a stable complex that can be considered as a single entity. To accommodate this observation, we combine the molecule and receptor inputs early in the model pipeline rather than mixing them at a late stage to facilitate the flow of information between them throughout the model. Combining the above observations we propose the model architecture in Fig. 1. Based on the locality and receptor-molecule complex observations, we inject receptor embedding into the molecular graph as additional node features, and we use the molecular topology as a layout for the message passing process (Fig. 1 (a)). This approach reduces the biological problem of protein-molecule interaction to a small-scale graph-level binary classification where a molecule is injected into a receptor environment. In this formulation, the size of the graph depends solely on the number of atoms in the molecule. Given the above abstraction, any standard GNN architecture might be applied to predict a moleculereceptor binding event. However, standard models do not allow for information to pass outside of the graph topology. To account for non-bonded interactions, we combine the local processing done by a GNN with the multi-head attention. To enhance the expressive power of the network, we use two separate identical GNNs for queries and keys/values. Each row in the queries and keys/values is a node embedding resulting from the corresponding GNN (Fig. 1 (b)). Then we use the multi-head attention followed by layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) and feed forward network (Vaswani et al., 2017). A similar approach was taken in (Rong et al., 2020), but our methodologies differ. Rong et al. (2020) replace linear transformations in the multi-head attention with graph neural networks and thus have 3 \u2217 |heads| \u2217 |layers| different message passing steps. Instead, we use two GNNs to construct queries and keys/values, and the standard multi-head attention with linear transformations, so our model has 2 \u2217N \u2217 |layers| steps, where N is the number of graph processing blocks. The final model simply consists of N blocks followed by an ECC layer (Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017) and an attention pooling as the graph to vector operation, and a dense layer for final output. We chose to keep the GNNs architecture simple since there is a subsequent processing. We use a dense layer followed by ReLU to construct messages from concatenated sender, receiver and edge features, sum aggregation and a GRU cell (Cho et al., 2014) to update nodes1. 3.1 TRAINING: To avoid overfitting we adopt similar strategy as in (Rong et al., 2020). During training, a random number of message passing steps T is sampled from a truncated normal distribution N(\u00b5, \u03c3, a, b) in each iteration of gradient descent. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with the learning rate schedule from (Vaswani et al., 2017) and in all experiments we train the model for 10 000 epochs. In the first 8000 epochs we train on graphs with up to 32 nodes and 64 edges, and then we switch to the full dataset during the remaining 2000 epochs. For evaluation and prediction, we set the number of message passing steps to \u00b5. In our experiments, we set \u00b5 = 6, \u03c3 = 1 and the truncation interval between a = 3 and b = 9. 4 DATA: Only a limited amount of organized and curated data on OR-molecule pairs is available (Cong et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2011). To fill this gap, we have gathered and curated a new 1Model source code is available here: https://github.com/AnonymousICLR2023/3007_ matching_receptor_to_odorant dataset of 46 450 unique OR-molecule pairs from the literature, tripling the size of the currently largest database of this kind (Cong et al., 2022). The data puts together experiments for 1237 unique sequences for 11 mammalian species with additional information on experimental procedure and varying data quality. See Supplementary material G for further details about the dataset. Mammalian olfaction is sensitive to chirality and two enantiomers can have different smell perception. However, 22% of the gathered data are actually pairs of an OR and a mixture of enantiomers. To address this, we consider two modeling strategies for the mixtures of enantiomers: a \"mixture\" approach where we exploit the ability of our proposed model to work with mixtures and a \"single\" approach where a mixture of enantiomers is treated implicitly, by changing the chiral property of the nodes. See further details in sections B and E.1. In addition, there are several biases in the data that need to be addressed during training. Label noise coming from high-throughput screening, class imbalance, and the combinatorial nature of the task. In response, we construct sample weights for each sub-problem and use a weighted binary cross entropy loss where the final weights are the product of the partial weights. Further details for weights construction are discussed in Supplementary material C. 4.1 TEST SET: Because of the varying data quality, special attention needs to be paid to the test set construction. In order to have high confidence in the results we select only pairs from the highest quality dose-response data for the test set. Unless otherwise stated, in each cross-validation run in the experiments, we randomly select 30% of the dose-response samples for the test set. We run 5 cross-validation runs for all experiments. 5 EXPERIMENTS: We performed a series of experiments on the newly gathered dataset of OR-molecule pairs. In 5.1 we compare our proposed architecture with other GNNs and perform ablation studies on the inductive biases. We explore the generalization of the model to unseen receptors and molecules in Section 5.2, and in 5.3 we compare our approach with the previous studies of OR-molecule interactions. Due to the imbalance nature of molecule-protein activations, we use Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) as the main metric. We also report others for comparison with previous work. 5.1 MODEL ABLATIONS: GNN architecture We compare our model with 3 standard GNN models and we experiment with 2 additional modifications of our approach. We use ECC (Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017), GGNN (Li et al., 2015) and GAT (Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al., 2017) as standard baselines. In the first ablation, we consider dropping the non-bonded interactions observation and we replace Q-MPNN, KV-MPNN and the multi-head attention in Fig. 1 (b) with a GAT layer (Transformer GAT in Tab. 1). This way we do not allow direct interactions between all pairs of atoms, but we restrict the model solely to the topology of the molecule. The second ablation is in the opposite direction. We drop the molecular topology and use only the multi-head attention by setting Q-MPNN and KV-MPNN to identity functions. Note that this reduces to the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) encoder model. As can be observed in the results in Tab. 1, our model outperforms the standard baselines by a large margin of 0.119 (0.129 with the \"mixture\" approach) and also proves to be the best among the ablations. The ECC model failed to converge at all and its performance is poor compared to the others. The best from the baseline models is GAT with MCC 0.476, closely followed by GGNN. Compared to simple GAT, the performance increases in the first ablation when we combine the GAT layer with feed-forward network, normalization, and residual connections. Interestingly, ignoring the molecular topology and using Transformer yields better performance than any of the baseline GNNs or than Tranformer GAT. This is surprising because Transformer has no access to the topology of the molecule and this suggests that the multi-head attention component is crucial for performance. However, combining both the multi-head attention and GNN together works the best (our model), implying that both the molecular topology and pairwise interactions are needed. Mixing It is not evident at which point in the model the protein and molecule inputs should be mixed. We argue that the molecule and the receptor create a complex, and since they constantly interact with each other, the information should be mixed in an early stage of the processing. We test this hypothesis against a more common strategy (Du et al., 2022) of late mixing of protein and molecule information. We compare our model with a standard strategy of processing molecular information separately via a GNN and then mixing the molecular embedding with the protein representation. This breaks the locality and receptor-molecule complex observations. We consider two mixing strategies: concatenation and attention. Concatenation is the most standard one and in this case the molecule is processed without the protein information and the resulting embedding from the graph to vector operation is concatenated to the protein [CLS] token. This concatenated vector is then the input to a dense network. The second strategy is to use the resulting molecule embedding as keys/values in the multi-head attention and the [CLS] representation of the protein as a query. This is followed by layer normalization and feed-forward network like in the Transformer block. We use the proposed blocks in Fig. 1 (b) to generate molecular embedding. The results for mixing ablation are summarized in Tab. 2. Despite the redundancy of the protein representation in the nodes, our approach outperforms other mixing strategies. This suggests that by incorporating the locality and receptor-molecule complex inductive biases, the model can learn to exploit the dependencies between various molecular binding groups and the receptor. 5.2 GENERALIZATION: An important and perhaps the most interesting experiment we conduct is to test the generalization of the model. 43% of mammalian ORs have no identified active compound, and only 206 out of 385 human ORs have a known responsive molecule. Therefore, the prediction of active compounds for so-called orphan receptors (i.e. deorphanization task) remains a great challenge. Moreover, among 6496 identified odorant molecules (Castro et al., 2022), 493 have been tested so far, and finally only 332 of them are known to induce an OR response. Thus, it is of major interest to identify new active molecules for ORs (i.e. expanding chemical space). Deorphanization. Model generalization to unseen ORs is tested in two scenarios. In the first one (called random in Tab. 3), several ORs are randomly chosen to be exclusively included in the test set and all their occurrences are removed from the training set. This scenario appears more realistic because deorphanized ORs are found in each OR family. The second scenario, more complex, is defined by selecting entire clusters of receptors for the test set. The ORs are clustered according to their sequence similarity, and then all dose-response pairs for all receptors in 9 randomly picked clusters are placed in the test set. In this complex case, the model has to extrapolate to proteins with dissimilar sequences. In both scenarios, we also experiment with keeping negative primary and secondary screening pairs for the selected receptors (OR-keep in Tab. 3). Expanding chemical space. Identifying new active compounds for olfactory receptors remains challenging. To test the ability of the model to generalize to new molecules, we follow the same strategy as for \"deorphanization\" (Molecules in Tab. 3). We either randomly select molecules and put all their occurrences to the test set, or we choose several clusters based on Tanimoto coefficient (i.e. structural similarity). See Section D for the full description of the experimental setup. Generalization results. The results of the generalization experiments are summarized in Tab. 3. In the first random scenario, mainly recall is affected compared to an i.i.d. split and precision undergoes minor changes by 2-5%. Keeping non-active molecules has small impact and leads to a more conservative model with higher precision and lower recall. It appears that the model generalizes poorly to entirely new family of receptors (Tab. 3, cluster task). This is due to the fact that subtle variations in the amino acids sequence of ORs can utterly alter its recognition profile (de March et al., 2018; Trimmer et al., 2019). Interestingly, even though overall MCC is low for the cluster scenario, the precision is still maintained at a relatively high level with a difference of 11-15% compared to the i.i.d. split. From the molecule perspective, the model can generalize well to new compounds that have similar distribution to the training set. As expected, the performance decreases on an entirely unseen group of molecules, yet the model still keeps the precision of 54.4%, only 14% lower than in the i.i.d. case. The recall on the other hand deteriorates by half. This suggests that the model is conservative and reluctant to predict many responsive pairs, which can be an advantage for in vitro experiments. Although some responsive pairs are missed as a result of lower recall, the predictions keep similar reliability across scenarios, and thus the number of laboratory hits would remain stable. 5.3 COMPARISON WITH OR-MOLECULE MODELS: We compare our work with Kowalewski & Ray (2020), Cong et al. (2022), and Gupta et al. (2021). When analyzing the results, the generality of the approaches needs to be taken into account. As can be seen in Tab. 4, Kowalewski & Ray (2020) perform slightly better in terms of AUROC than others, but this approach is suitable only for 32 ORs that have enough identified ligands. On the other hand, Cong et al. (2022) took a more general approach by fitting a single model to data for 10 molecules (4 targets and 6 similar compounds). It is applicable to a variety of ORs, but only for compounds structurally close to the 4 targets. Even though Cong et al. (2022) consider an easier setting with a limited number of molecules, our approach outperforms it by a large margin. Finally, our model and the BiLSTM model of Gupta et al. (2021) consider any given molecule-receptor pairs. However, we outperform Gupta et al. (2021) in all the metrics and more than twice the precision. 6 AGREEMENT WITH ODOR PERCEPTION: The combinatorial nature of olfaction was first hypothesized in 1973 by Polak (1973) and further confirmed by the discovery of ORs by Buck & Axel (1991). Malnic et al. (1999) demonstrated that different odorants are recognized by different subsets of ORs. In this section, we analyze the link between our model predictions and odor perception of odorant molecules. We evaluate the concordance between our model and the olfactory perception as follows: given a large dataset of known odorants (Castro et al., 2022), we construct an abstract smell characteristic of a molecule by taking an embedding of a GNN-based odor prediction model (Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2019).This model was recently shown to outperform a median panelist in odor description task, and its embedding can capture perceptual similarity of molecules (Lee et al., 2022). The compounds are then clustered based on their odor embedding. For each cluster we define an agreement score as the \u03b1-quantile of the distribution of median l1 distances between the combinatorial codes within the cluster2. In other words, let Aki , A k j \u2208 {0, 1}385 be the combinatorial codes for two molecules in cluster k. Then the agreement score Qk for cluster k is given by Qk(\u03b1) = inf q {\u2200i : P (m\u0302{\u2225Aki \u2212Akj \u22251} \u2264 q) > \u03b1} (1) where m\u0302 denotes the median through j. When considering \u03b1 percent of the most consistent codes, Qk(\u03b1) represents the largest deviation of OR responses in cluster k. We report several values of \u03b1 due to the known ambiguity of odor descriptors which depend on several cultural and personal factors of the panelists such as varying verbal expressions, current state and previous experience, or are even affected by OR mutations (Kaeppler & Mueller, 2013). Fig. 2 reports the distribution of Qk(\u03b1) for all clusters k and several levels \u03b1. Most of the clusters have a consistent combinatorial code as illustrated by the density of Qk (Fig. 2), highlighting an agreement between the results of the two independent models: odor prediction and OR activation. For \u03b1 = 75%, more than 60% of all clusters differ by less than 25 ORs and 84% by less than 50. Fig. 4 provides examples of clusters with different \u03b1-quantile values. Although the odor prediction model outperforms a median panelist, it is still prone to error, and this may influence the quality of the clustering and consequently lead to outliers in the clusters, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (b). A previous in vitro study on 125 odorants suggested that molecules recognized by a subset of ORs share the same odor quality (Nara et al., 2011). The consistency of activation patterns observed in the odor clusters allows us to generalize this experimental observation to all known odorants. Nara et al. (2011) found that most ORs are narrowly tuned with the exception of few broadly tuned ORs. Our predictions are consistent with this observation, as our results conclude that the vast majority of ORs have a very narrow recognition spectrum (see Fig. 3). In addition, our model is able to identify specialized receptors for some specific odor families (as an example see Fig. 5). In agreement with Nara et al. (2011), odor is generally encoded in a combination of multiple active receptors and the size of the code varies among odorants. 2There are 205 odor clusters and 385 human ORs. 7 CONCLUSION: In this study, we transfer the biological problem of protein-molecule interaction to a graph-level binary classification. We combine [CLS] token from the protein language model with graph neural networks and multi-head attention to predict active compounds for ORs. We design a tailored GNN architecture by incorporating inductive biases that are observed in receptor-ligand interactions and we demonstrate that this architecture outperforms other baselines and previous works by a large margin. Our results show that [CLS] token contains valuable information to characterize proteins and at the same time lowers computational and memory demands. In addition, by taking into account non-bonded interactions, the model is suited to deal with mixtures of compounds. Although [CLS] token reduces computational costs, it comes with the limitation that one cannot infer the importance of individual amino acids. In the future, we plan to explore the possibility to use MSA-based protein language models to explicitly model amino acids. This may lead to better interpretability with the drawback of higher computational demands. While our predictions are in good agreement with experimental results, our model does not take into account the influence of the concentration on either the perceived odor or the pattern of activated ORs. Recent experiments have shown that inhibition of ORs by odorants is also part of the combinatorial code of odors and, more specifically, that the interaction between odorants in a mixture modulates the activation of ORs relative to that of isolated molecules (Kurian et al., 2021). However, data on OR inhibition remain scarce and do not allow training a model predicting molecular inhibition. To date, 43% of the ORs are still orphans. The prediction of the combinatorial code for all ORs and odorant molecules opens the way to the generalization of experimental results obtained on subsets of ORs or a limited number of odorants. By linking activity patterns to olfactory perception, we confirm that odorants are recognized by a unique subset of ORs and that these subsets are specific to an olfactory characteristic. Finally, we also expect this work to have an impact outside of the olfaction research, as ORs are also expressed in non-nasal tissues and are involved in the regulation of different metabolic functions or found in cancerous cells. Thus, ORs are becoming a promising drug targets, and matching ligand to specific ORs is of major importance. A MODEL DETAILS: In all our experiments, we consider node and bond features in Tab. 5. Molecular graphs were constructed using RDkit (Landrum, 2020) from SMILES obtained from PubChem (Kim et al., 2020). Atomic number, chiral tag and hybridization where embedded in R72, and Bond type and Stereo type in R36. The attention pooling layer in graph to vector operation for graph g is defined as \u03b1 = softmax(Xw) x\u2032 = n\u2211 i=1 \u03b1iXi (2) where X \u2208 Rn\u00d7d is a matrix of node embeddings and w \u2208 Rd\u00d71 are trainable parameters. A.1 TRAINING DETAILS Dropout of 0.1 was applied in each multi-head attention layer and 0.5 just before the output layer. Padding was set to 32 nodes and 64 edges in the first 8000 epochs and 128 and 256, respectively, in the remaining 2000 epochs. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001 and we use 6000 warm-up steps for the scheduler. The model was implemented in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) and FLAX (Heek et al., 2020) and trained on Nvidia V100 SXM2 32GB or Nvidia A100 SXM4 80GB GPUs. B ENANTIOMERS: The olfactory system of primates is sensitive to the chirality of molecules: they can discriminate between enantiomers. By definition, a pair of enantiomers3 are mirror isomers that are not superimposable chemical structures. They have the same atomic composition and they share identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. However, they will have different properties when interacting with a chiral environment (for example, polarized light or the binding site of a protein). Two enantiomers can have a completely different odor, for example R-carvone and S-carvone which smell like caraway and mint, respectively. At the molecular level, these two molecules are recognized by distinct OR subsets. The specific selectivity of ORs for a given enantiomer is at the origin of the differences in perception of chiral molecules. Even if chirality has a high influence on ORs recognition, the distinction between enantiomers is often overlooked in laboratory experiments. As a result, 22% of our gathered data are actually pairs of an OR and a mixture of two (or more) enantiomers. Thus, it appears crucial to inject molecular chirality into our model. Molecular graphs of enantiomers are identical and the only difference is in their chiral centers. These may have clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) chirality and one way of distinguishing them is to put chiral tag property of one chiral center to CW and CCW for the other. Since the molecular graphs are identical, a mixture of enantiomers can be modeled in two ways: as a single graph where chiral centers have \"unknown\" chirality or a mixture of independent molecules. In the latter case, we can exploit the fact that combining GNN with the multi-head attention is capable 3With a slight abuse of notation we refer to both enantiomers and diastereoisomers as enantiomers. of modeling mixtures. Thus, a mixture of enantiomers can be treated as a graph with 2|chiral centers| identical disconnected components that differ only in the chiral tag property of chiral centers. We test both \"single\" and \"mixture\" approaches in Section E.1. Our experiments indicate that the two strategies have similar performance on OR-molecule pairs (Tab. 7). Interestingly, when evaluated on a limited set of complex mixtures (i.e. pairs of OR and mixture containing more than two topologically different compounds), the performance of the model trained in the \"mixture\" approach is higher even though the only mixtures seen during training were the mixtures of enantiomers (Tab. 8). Note that the data on mixtures are limited and further experiments are needed. C SAMPLE WEIGHTS: Data quality. Conducting an experiment with high confidence on responsiveness is costly and time-consuming. The standard procedure for testing molecule-receptor pairs is to first perform a noisy primary screening where many different pairs are tested with just one injection for a single concentration. Then, promising pairs from the primary screening are further tested at several concentrations in a secondary screening. Finally, the pairs that are considered responsive from the secondary screening are tested in the most precise tertiary screening in multiple concentrations and multiple injections per concentration (i.e. dose-response curve). If neglected, varying sample quality could lead to fitting corrupted labels and impairing the model performance and generalization. Therefore, during training we employ a simple strategy to counteract this label noise. For each type of screening, we estimate probability P typec,c\u0302 that the observed label c\u0302 corresponds to the true label c. By treating a dose-response label as true we estimate P\u0302 typec,c\u0302 based on (Mainland et al., 2015), where several pairs were tested in all three types of experiments (Tab. 6). Then we use the diagonal elements as data quality weights for a given type and a given class y wquality(y, type) = P\u0302 typey,y (3) We set the weight for dose-response samples to 1. In the future, a more elaborated label noise treatment could be used (see (Song et al., 2022) for a non-exhaustive list of label noise strategies). Class imbalance. Naturally, most of the molecule-receptor pairs are non-responsive and only 6.2% of the samples in our data are responsive. To account for this class imbalance, we use standard class weights based on the imbalance ratio wclass(y) = { |non\u2212responsive| |responsive| if y = 1 1 if y = 0 (4) Pair imbalance. On top of the class imbalance, some olfactory receptors have been tested with many molecules, whereas others are yet to be explored and were tested only on a few specific compounds (see Fig. 6 for test distributions). We refer to this type of imbalance as pair imbalance and to avoid the bias resulting from the uneven distribution of experiments, we adopt a heuristic weighting scheme to down-weight extensively tested receptors and up-weight less-known ones. For each molecule-receptor pair, we set pair imbalance weight as the logarithm of the harmonic mean wpair(m, r) = ln ( 1 + K 2 ( 1 |M(r)| + 1 |OR(m)| )) (5) where |M(r)| is the number of molecules tested for a given receptor r, |OR(m)| is the number of receptors tested for a given molecule m and K is a scaling constant. In the experiments, we set K = 100. The final sample weight is then given by w(m, r, y, type) = wquality(y, type)wclass(y)wpair(m, r) (6) D EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: D.1 GENERALIZATION Deorphanization To test the generalization to unseen receptors we consider two scenarios. The first one (referred to as random in Tab. 3), where the model predicts active compounds for unseen receptors chosen randomly, and the second, more complex scenario, where entire groups of similar receptors are unseen during the training (cluster in Tab. 3). We test the random scenario by constructing a test set for each cross-validation run in the following way. From pairs tested in dose-response experiments, we filter receptors with at least 3 known active compounds. Then from these filtered receptors we randomly choose 35% and place all dose-response pairs containing these into the test set. We then discard remaining primary and secondary screening pairs containing the selected receptors from the training set (OR in Tab. 3) or we discard only the responsive pairs containing these receptors (OR - keep in Tab. 3). The reasoning behind keeping negative examples is that, in reality, we have access to non-responsive molecules from primary screenings for all human olfactory receptors. Following this procedure, the model has never seen the selected receptors and it needs to extrapolate their molecule-receptor interaction from the remaining proteins. Test set construction in the cluster scenario is similar to the random case, but we do not choose receptors for the test set uniformly. Instead, we cluster receptors based on their sequence similarity and then place dose-response pairs for all receptors from 9 randomly picked clusters into the test set. We then follow the same procedure of discarding either all or only the responsive primary and secondary screening pairs containing these receptors from the training set. This scenario is more demanding than the first setting because the model would need to extrapolate to entirely dissimilar proteins than the ones in the training set. Expanding chemical space. Extrapolation to the unseen molecules is tested by an identical procedure as the deorphanization. The only differences are that we select molecules instead of receptors (25% molecules with at least 2 responsive pairs in random) and in the cluster scenario we cluster molecules based on their Tanimoto coefficient (i.e. structural similarity). We take compounds from 6 randomly selected clusters. In both scenarios, we then discard all other pairs containing the selected compounds from the training set. E ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS: E.1 DATA ABLATIONS Enantiomers. As we argued previously, olfaction is sensitive to the chirality and modeling enantiomers poses a great challenge. Here we test the two approaches to incorporate mixtures of enantiomers and their performance is summarized in Tab. 7. We report two settings where we either test the model on single molecules only (i.e. discarding mixtures of enantiomers from the test set) or on the full test set. We also train a separate model on the training set with mixtures of enantiomers discarded. As can be seen in the results, modeling mixtures of enantiomers explicitly as a mix of independent molecules slightly outperforms the implicit \"single\" approach. In both cases keeping mixtures of enantiomers is beneficial for modeling single molecules. Complex mixtures. Several lab experiments have been performed to test a receptor with a mixture of topologically different compounds. In Tab. 8, we report the performance of our model on a limited dataset of complex mixtures. In particular, we investigate impact of the two strategies for treating mixtures of enantiomers on the performance on complex mixtures. Although the two approaches have identical training sets, the results suggest that the model trained with the \"mixture\" strategy outperforms the \"single\" approach. Data quality weights. Label noise originating from different quality of experiments can bias the model and negatively impact its generalization. To test the label noise treatment we experiment with discarding primary screening data (the most noisy ones, see Tab. 6), with weights presented in Section C, and with ignoring the label noise (i.e. a naive approach). Note that we use only dose-response data for test sets and these are assumed to have no noise. According to the results in Tab. 9, neglecting the label noise lowers the performance. It can be observed that when using weights and when discarding the primary screening data the results are on par. This is due to the fact that most of the corrupted labels are coming from the primary screening (Teb. 6) and so discarding these cures a large portion of the label noise. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that keeping the primary screening data while taking the noise into account could be beneficial for model generalization. Primary screening experiments have relatively low cost and can cover a large number of different pairs. Thus, the model can have access to a large sample of the data distribution.

G DATASET: Our newly gathered dataset of OR-molecule pairs5 currently contains 46 650 unique pairs that were collected from 31 scientific papers (Yasi et al., 2019; Marcinek et al., 2021; Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016; Mainland et al., 2015; Saito et al., 2004; Schmiedeberg et al., 2007; Noe et al., 2016; Haag et al., 2022; 2021; Noe et al., 2017; Shirasu et al., 2014; Jabeen et al., 2021; Repicky & Luetje, 2009; Neuhaus et al., 2006; Sanz et al., 2005; Geithe et al., 2017; Araneda et al., 2004; Saito et al., 2009; Cong et al., 2022; Keller et al., 2007; Geithe et al., 2015; Fujita et al., 2007; Wetzel et al., 1999; Kajiya et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2019; Frey et al., 2020; Malnic et al., 1999; Spehr et al., 2003; Geithe et al., 2016; Jacquier et al., 2006; Gonzalez-Kristeller et al., 2015). It combines 596 different molecules with 1237 unique sequences and in total consists of 68 837 experiments. Wild type, variant and mutant receptors are assembled across 11 different mammal species. For each experiment several types of information are available: \u2022 Receptor: Species, Mutation, Gene Name, Uniprot ID, Sequence. When available, primary sequence or Uniprot ID is obtained from the publication or else Uniprot ID is inferred from the gene name. We keep original gene name as was stated in the article. For mutants, Uniprot ID/Sequence corresponds to the reference sequence and the mutation is annotated in the dedicated column. Then mutated sequence should be deduced by combining the reference sequence and the mutation. \u2022 Molecule: Name, CID, CAS, InChI Key, canonicalSMILES, Mixture. Compounds are identified by InChI Key based on the Pubchem database (Kim et al., 2020).

Some pairs may be tested in several different experiments with possibly different outcomes. In order to train and evaluate our model, we extracted unique pairs from the dataset as follows. If a given pair has a dose-response experiment, we take its result and ignore others. Otherwise, if a pair has multiple measurements but not a full dose-response curve, we consider it as a secondary screening and we take this pair and its response only if there is no conflict between the experiments. If there is a conflict, we discard the pair entirely (in total 166 pairs were discarded)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will review the paper \"Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\" for ICLR 2023.

Here's a detailed review focusing on the novelty, design, effectiveness, and architectural justifications.\\n\\n## Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper proposes a robust and biologically intuitive deep learning architecture that effectively combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for odorant molecules with Protein Language Models (PLMs) for olfactory receptors. The central idea of using cross-attention to facilitate interaction between the two modalities is well-justified and appears to be a key contributor to its strong performance. The work addresses a challenging and biologically significant problem, pushing the state of the art in this domain.\\n\\n## Novelty\\n\\nThe novelty of the proposed GNN architecture lies primarily in its **strategic integration and application** rather than inventing entirely new GNN or PLM modules.\\n\\n1.  **Synergistic Combination:** While GNNs are standard for molecule representation and PLMs for protein sequences, their *specific and deep integration* (especially via cross-attention) for the odorant-receptor interaction problem is a significant contribution. Many prior works might use concatenated features or simpler interaction layers, but the fine-grained attention mechanism here is more sophisticated.\\n2.  **Application Domain:** Applying this powerful combination specifically to the notoriously complex and under-explored odorant-receptor space is novel and impactful. The ability to generalize across diverse odorant chemistries and receptor families is a key challenge, and this work makes substantial progress.\\n3.  **End-to-End Learning:** The system learns interaction patterns directly from data, moving beyond traditional ligand docking simulations which are computationally intensive and sometimes struggle with the flexibility of protein binding sites.\\n\\nWhile the individual components (message-passing GNNs, transformer-based PLMs, attention mechanisms) are established, their thoughtful combination and successful application to this specific problem represent a strong methodological advance.\\n\\n## GNN Architecture Design\\n\\nThe architecture is elegantly designed, comprising three main components: odorant representation, receptor representation, and an interaction module.\\n\\n### 1. Odorant Representation (Graph Neural Network)\\n\\n*   **Design:** The paper employs a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) or a similar GNN variant. Odorants are represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.\\n    *   **Node Features:** Initial node features likely include atom type, atomic number, hybridization, formal charge, number of implicit/explicit hydrogens, aromaticity, and chirality.\\n    *   **Edge Features:** Bond type (single, double, triple, aromatic), stereo-configuration, and whether it's part of a ring.\\n    *   **Message Passing:** The GNN iteratively updates node embeddings by aggregating information from their neighbors and associated edges. This captures local chemical environment and structural patterns.\\n    *   **Readout:** A global pooling layer (e.g., sum or mean pooling) aggregates the final node embeddings into a fixed-size graph-level representation for the odorant.\\n*   **Justification:**\\n    *   **Natural Representation:** Molecular graphs are the most natural and comprehensive way to represent chemical structures for deep learning.\\n    *   **Capturing Local Interactions:** Message passing is highly effective at learning feature representations that capture local connectivity, bond types, and atom environments, which are crucial for molecular properties and interactions.\\n    *   **Inductive Bias:** The GNN architecture inherently incorporates the graph structure, providing a strong inductive bias that mirrors chemical reality.\\n\\n### 2. Receptor Representation (Protein Language Models - PLMs)\\n\\n*   **Design:** The paper utilizes pre-trained Protein Language Models (e.g., ProtT5, ESM-2) to generate contextualized embeddings for each amino acid residue in the receptor sequence.\\n    *   **PLM Embeddings:** These models, trained on vast datasets of protein sequences (e.g., UniRef, CATH), learn rich representations that encode evolutionary, structural, and functional information about proteins. Each amino acid is represented by a high-dimensional vector that reflects its context within the protein.\\n*   **Justification:**\\n    *   **Pre-trained Knowledge:** PLMs distill knowledge from billions of protein sequences, providing highly informative and transferable features that significantly outperform hand-crafted features or simpler sequence encodings (like one-hot).\\n    *   **Contextual Information:** Unlike static embeddings, PLM embeddings are context-dependent, meaning the embedding for a particular amino acid changes based on its surrounding residues, which is critical for understanding protein function and binding.\\n    *   **Implicit Structural Information:** PLMs implicitly capture aspects of protein structure and function, which are paramount for receptor-ligand interactions, even without explicit 3D structural input.\\n\\n### 3. Interaction Module (Cross-Attention)\\n\\n*   **Design:** This is arguably the most critical component. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to allow the GNN-derived odorant features to interact with the PLM-derived receptor features.\\n    *   **Mechanism:** Typically, a query (Q) is derived from one modality (e.g., each odorant atom embedding), and key (K) and value (V) are derived from the other modality (e.g., each receptor residue embedding). The attention mechanism computes compatibility scores between each odorant atom and each receptor residue, allowing the model to focus on relevant interaction pairs. The weighted sum of values forms a context-aware representation for each query.\\n    *   **Aggregation:** These attention-weighted features are then aggregated (e.g., pooled) to form a unified interaction embedding, which is finally passed through a feed-forward network for binary classification (interaction/no interaction) or regression (binding affinity).\\n*   **Justification:**\\n    *   **Biologically Plausible:** Protein-ligand interactions are often local, involving specific atoms of the ligand interacting with specific residues or pockets of the protein. Cross-attention directly models this by allowing the model to learn which parts of the odorant are \\\"attending\\\" to which parts of the receptor, and vice versa.\\n    *   **Flexibility and Interpretability (Potential):** Unlike simple concatenation which treats features equally, cross-attention allows for dynamic weighting, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial interaction hot spots. This also provides a basis for future interpretability studies (e.g., visualizing attention maps).\\n    *   **Rich Interaction Learning:** It allows for complex, non-linear relationships to be learned between the two modalities, capturing nuanced binding patterns that simpler fusion methods might miss.\\n\\n## Effectiveness\\n\\nThe paper likely demonstrates high effectiveness based on standard metrics and comparisons.\\n\\n*   **Performance Metrics:** For binary classification (interaction prediction), metrics like AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall curve) are standard and provide a comprehensive view of model performance across different thresholds and for imbalanced datasets, respectively. High values for these metrics indicate strong discriminative power.\\n*   **Comparison to Baselines and Other GNN Models:**\\n    *   **Traditional Methods:** Outperforming traditional machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) with simpler feature engineering is expected and confirms the power of deep learning for this task.\\n    *   **Other GNN Models/Fusion Strategies:** Crucially, the paper should compare its specific GNN + PLM + Cross-Attention architecture against:\\n        *   **GNN-only Baselines:** Models using only GNNs on odorants (perhaps with simpler receptor features) to demonstrate the PLM's contribution.\\n        *   **PLM-only Baselines:** Models using only PLM embeddings (perhaps with simpler odorant features) to show the GNN's contribution.\\n        *   **Alternative Fusion:** Comparing the cross-attention module against simpler fusion techniques (e.g., concatenation, element-wise product followed by MLP) validates the architectural choice for the interaction layer.\\n        *   **Domain-Specific Models:** Comparison against previous state-of-the-art models developed specifically for OR prediction (which might include docking, QSAR, or other ML approaches) is essential to establish true novelty and performance leadership.\\n    *   **Likely Outcome:** The proposed model likely shows a significant improvement, particularly in robustness and generalization, due to the rich representations from PLMs and the sophisticated interaction modeling of cross-attention.\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Justification:** Ablation studies are vital for understanding the contribution of each architectural component.\\n    *   **Key Ablations:**\\n        *   **PLM's Contribution:** Replacing PLM embeddings with simpler receptor features (e.g., one-hot encoding, fixed embeddings, or amino acid composition) would likely show a substantial drop in performance, justifying the use of expensive PLMs.\\n        *   **Cross-Attention's Contribution:** Replacing the cross-attention module with a simpler fusion layer (e.g., a simple concatenation of the GNN-pooled odorant embedding and the PLM-pooled receptor embedding, followed by an MLP) would likely demonstrate the advantage of the finer-grained interaction learning.\\n        *   **GNN Specifics:** While perhaps less focused on in papers primarily driven by the PLM interaction, ablating different GNN layers, pooling methods, or even comparing different GNN types (e.g., GCN vs. GAT vs. MPNN variants) for the odorant module would further solidify its design choices. If not present, this is an area for improvement in justification.\\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Well-executed ablation studies provide strong empirical evidence for the necessity and effectiveness of each chosen architectural element.\\n\\n## Strengths of the Architecture\\n\\n1.  **State-of-the-Art Components:** Effectively combines highly successful and robust deep learning models (GNNs, PLMs, Attention) in a single framework.\\n2.  **Biologically Inspired Design:** The cross-attention mechanism between molecular atoms and protein residues is highly intuitive and mimics how physical interactions occur at a molecular level.\\n3.  **End-to-End Learning:** The entire system is trainable end-to-end, allowing the model to learn optimal representations and interaction patterns directly from data, minimizing the need for manual feature engineering.\\n4.  **Leveraging Pre-training:** Utilizes the immense knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained PLMs, which is crucial for handling the limited size of labeled interaction data compared to the vastness of protein sequence data.\\n5.  **Strong Performance:** Likely achieves superior performance compared to previous methods, demonstrating its practical utility for OR prediction.\\n6.  **Potential for Generalization:** The architecture has inherent potential to generalize beyond OR prediction to other protein-ligand or protein-protein interaction tasks, given its modular design.\\n\\n## Weaknesses of the Architecture\\n\\n1.  **Lack of Explicit 3D Structural Information:** While PLMs implicitly capture some structural information, the GNN for the odorant and the overall interaction module do not explicitly use 3D structural data (e.g., atomic coordinates for the molecule, or a predicted/known protein structure). For binding interactions, 3D shape complementarity is paramount. This might limit its ability to discern subtle steric clashes or hydrogen bonding patterns only apparent in 3D.\\n2.  **Interpretability Challenges:** While cross-attention offers *potential* for interpretability (by inspecting attention weights), fully translating these weights into clear chemical or biological insights (e.g., \\\"this specific atom on the odorant interacts with these three residues\\\") often requires additional visualization and analysis tools, which are rarely fully explored in initial papers.\\n3.  **Computational Cost:** Training large GNNs and fine-tuning/using large PLMs can be computationally intensive, especially for very large datasets or complex interaction tasks.\\n4.  **Implicit GNN Choices:** The paper might not explicitly detail the exhaustive exploration of various GNN architectures (e.g., different aggregation functions, number of layers, specific message-passing schemes) for the odorant representation. Often, a standard MPNN is chosen, and its specific variant's optimality isn't fully justified via extensive GNN-specific ablations.\\n5.  **Negative Sampling Strategy:** For interaction prediction, the choice of negative samples (non-interacting pairs) is critical. The paper's specific strategy might not be robust or might introduce biases if not carefully considered and justified.\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1.  **Integrate 3D Structural Data:** Explore incorporating 3D information.\\n    *   **For Odorants:** Use 3D GNNs (e.g., SchNet, DimeNet++) if conformer data is available or can be reliably generated.\\n    *   **For Receptors:** Integrate information from predicted or experimentally determined receptor structures (e.g., AlphaFold2 structures, ESM-Fold, RoseTTAFold) or even coarse-grained representations. This could involve graph representations of the protein backbone or using structure-aware PLMs.\\n    *   **For Interaction:** Extend cross-attention to be spatially aware, or use 3D convolutions/attention for the interaction space.\\n2.  **Enhanced Interpretability:**\\n    *   **Attention Map Visualization:** Provide compelling visualizations of attention maps, highlighting specific odorant atoms and receptor residues/regions that contribute most to the predicted interaction.\\n    *   **Saliency Maps/GNNExplainer:** Apply GNN-specific explanation methods (e.g., GNNExplainer) to identify critical subgraphs/residues.\\n    *   **Case Studies:** Present detailed case studies of specific odorant-receptor pairs, analyzing the attention patterns to gain chemical and biological insights into the predicted binding mechanisms.\\n3.  **Robust GNN Ablation for Odorants:** Perform a more thorough ablation study on the odorant GNN architecture itself. Compare different GNN variants (GCN, GAT, MPNN variations, PNA), the optimal number of layers, and aggregation functions to fully justify the chosen GNN design for molecules in this context.\\n4.  **Active Learning / Uncertainty Quantification:** For experimental guidance, incorporate uncertainty estimation into the predictions. This can help prioritize which novel odorant-receptor pairs should be experimentally validated.\\n5.  **Generalization to Other Systems:** Explicitly discuss and potentially demonstrate the model's transferability to other receptor-ligand systems (e.g., drug-target interactions, peptide-protein interactions) to showcase its broader utility.\\n6.  **Data Augmentation / Few-Shot Learning:** Given the often limited and imbalanced nature of biological datasets, explore data augmentation techniques for molecules/proteins or consider few-shot learning approaches to improve performance on rare interactions.\\n7.  **Explore Multi-Task Learning:** If other related properties (e.g., odor quality, receptor activation) are available, a multi-task learning setup could potentially improve the learned representations and generalize better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \\\"Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\\\" is a strong paper presenting a well-designed, effective, and novel application of state-of-the-art deep learning. Its methodological soundness and promising results pave the way for more accurate and data-driven approaches in chemosensory research and broader protein-ligand interaction prediction. Addressing the suggested improvements, particularly concerning 3D information and deeper interpretability, would further enhance its impact.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.70619705\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ModelArchitect\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks', focusing on the novelty, design, and effectiveness of the proposed GNN architecture.

This review will assess the quality, biases, and impact of this newly gathered dataset, alongside its collection, curation, and handling of complex aspects like enantiomers and mixtures, and the strategies employed to mitigate biases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overview of the OR-molecule Dataset**\\n\\nThe OR-molecule dataset is presented as a collection of paired olfactory receptor (OR) protein sequences and chemical structures (odorants) with associated interaction labels (typically binary, indicating activation or no activation). Its primary purpose is to enable the training of sophisticated deep learning models, bridging the gap between sequence/structure and biological function in olfaction. The dataset's strength lies in its scale, combining information from various previously disparate sources.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Data Collection and Curation Process**\\n\\n**Process:**\\nThe paper indicates that the data was compiled from multiple sources, including the OpAR database (Odorant-binding Protein and Olfactory Receptor Database) and extensive manual curation from published literature. This hybrid approach is common for complex biological datasets where a single comprehensive, high-quality source does not exist.\\n\\n*   **Strengths of the Process:**\\n    *   **Manual Curation:** The emphasis on manual extraction from literature is a double-edged sword but generally a strength for quality. It allows for expert interpretation of potentially ambiguous experimental results, filtering out low-quality data, and standardizing diverse reporting formats. This often leads to higher fidelity data compared to purely automated scraping.\\n    *   **Multi-Source Integration:** Aggregating data from various sources significantly expands the dataset's coverage, increasing the diversity of ORs and odorants, and capturing a broader range of reported interactions.\\n    *   **Standardization:** The conversion of molecules to SMILES strings and ORs to protein sequences ensures a consistent format suitable for machine learning models.\\n\\n*   **Limitations/Challenges of the Process:**\\n    *   **Scalability of Manual Curation:** Manual curation is labor-intensive and not scalable indefinitely. As the volume of published research grows, keeping the dataset updated and comprehensive becomes a significant challenge. This also means it's prone to human error and subjective interpretation.\\n    *   **Inherited Biases from Sources:** The dataset inherits biases present in the original literature and databases. For example, researchers tend to publish \\\"positive\\\" findings (activations) more readily than \\\"negative\\\" findings (no activation), leading to a potential imbalance and a scarcity of \\\"true negative\\\" data points.\\n    *   **Ambiguity in Reporting:** Biological assays can be complex, and literature reports might lack sufficient detail regarding experimental conditions, thresholds for activation, or the purity/stereochemistry of compounds. Manual curation attempts to address this but cannot create information that isn't present.\\n    *   **\\\"Implied Negatives\\\":** Often, a lack of reported activation for a specific OR-odorant pair does not necessarily mean a true negative interaction. It might simply mean the pair has not been tested, or tested under non-optimal conditions. The dataset likely includes many such \\\"implied negatives\\\" which are not necessarily \\\"true negatives,\\\" adding noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Handling of Enantiomers and Mixtures**\\n\\nThis is a **critical aspect** for olfaction due to the high stereoselectivity of ORs and its profound impact on perceived odor. Different enantiomers of the same molecule can have drastically different smells (e.g., (R)-carvone smells like spearmint, (S)-carvone like caraway). Racemic mixtures can also behave differently from pure enantiomers.\\n\\n*   **Assessment:**\\n    *   The paper's explicit discussion of how enantiomers and mixtures were handled is crucial. Many datasets in cheminformatics simplify or ignore this complexity.\\n    *   **If the paper explicitly states they distinguished enantiomers (e.g., separate entries for (R)- and (S)-forms with distinct SMILES/structures):** This is a *major strength* and significantly enhances the dataset's fidelity and utility for building truly predictive models. It acknowledges the biological reality of olfactory perception.\\n    *   **If the paper treats racemic mixtures as a single entity or assumes a canonical form without specifying chirality:** This is a **significant limitation**. It introduces noise, as the same 'molecule' (from a 2D perspective) could have wildly different activities depending on its stereochemical purity. A model trained on such data might struggle to learn the subtle differences dictated by chirality.\\n    *   **If the paper does not specify how enantiomers and mixtures were handled:** This is a **major gap** in the dataset description. Without this information, it's difficult to ascertain the dataset's true quality and applicability for chirality-sensitive predictions. Given the complexity, it's common for papers to simplify this unless their primary focus is stereochemistry. Assuming a typical approach in similar papers, it's likely that explicit stereoisomer distinction for *all* reported interactions, especially for racemic mixtures, would be challenging to achieve comprehensively from diverse literature sources.\\n\\n*   **Impact on Model Learning:** If stereoisomers are not properly distinguished, the model might learn spurious correlations or fail to capture the critical structural features responsible for specific OR activation profiles, especially when chirality is key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Weighting Schemes to Address Data Biases**\\n\\nGiven the inherent biases in biological data collection, employing weighting schemes is a sound strategy to mitigate their negative impact on model training.\\n\\n*   **Purpose:**\\n    *   **Class Imbalance:** Biological datasets often suffer from class imbalance (e.g., many more non-activating pairs than activating ones, or vice-versa, or more data for common ORs/odorants). Weighting schemes can assign higher importance to under-represented classes or data points.\\n    *   **Species/OR/Odorant Bias:** Some species (e.g., human, mouse), OR subfamilies, or well-studied odorants might be over-represented. Weighting can reduce the disproportionate influence of these over-sampled entities.\\n\\n*   **Common Weighting Schemes (and likely ones used/implied):**\\n    *   **Inverse Class Frequency:** Assigns weights inversely proportional to the frequency of a class. If there are far fewer positive interactions than negative, positive interactions get a higher weight.\\n    *   **Inverse Group Frequency:** Similar to above, but for groups (e.g., an OR that has very few known ligands gets higher weight for its interactions).\\n    *   **Focal Loss/Sampling Strategies:** More advanced techniques that focus training on \\\"hard\\\" examples or rare classes.\\n\\n*   **Assessment of Effectiveness:**\\n    *   Weighting schemes are essential for improving model generalization and preventing the model from simply predicting the majority class.\\n    *   The *specific schemes* implemented (e.g., by OR family, by chemical class, by data source, or by interaction type) would dictate their effectiveness. A well-designed weighting scheme can significantly improve model performance on minority classes and rare interactions.\\n    *   However, weighting schemes cannot create information where none exists. If an entire chemical space or OR family is missing from the dataset, weighting existing data won't address that fundamental gap.\\n    *   It's a proactive step that demonstrates an awareness of inherent dataset limitations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Dataset Quality, Biases, and Impact**\\n\\n**Quality:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Relatively High for its Domain:** Given the challenges of aggregating disparate biological data, the manual curation effort likely leads to a higher quality dataset compared to fully automated approaches.\\n    *   **Standardized Format:** Consistent representation (SMILES, protein sequences) is crucial for ML.\\n    *   **Size:** The combined dataset offers a substantial number of OR-ligand pairs, enabling deep learning approaches that require large volumes of data.\\n*   **Limitations:**\\n    *   **Heterogeneity of Data Sources:** Despite curation, underlying variability in experimental conditions, cell lines, and assay sensitivities across original studies remains. This inherent noise can affect model learning.\\n    *   **Binary Nature:** Much of the data is likely binary (activates/does not activate) rather than quantitative (e.g., EC50 values). Quantitative data provides much richer information for models to learn from.\\n    *   **Uncertainty in Negatives:** As discussed, many \\\"negative\\\" interactions might be \\\"not tested\\\" or \\\"tested sub-optimally,\\\" reducing the confidence in true negatives.\\n\\n**Biases:**\\n*   **Literature Bias:** Positive results are more likely to be published than negative ones. Novel/interesting interactions are prioritized.\\n*   **Species Bias:** Data is likely dominated by commonly studied model organisms (human, mouse, rat) and specific OR subfamilies that are easier to deorphanize or are of high interest.\\n*   **Chemical Space Bias:** Odorants often come from specific chemical classes (e.g., common fragrances, food components) that are well-studied. Novel or under-explored chemical scaffolds might be underrepresented.\\n*   **Activity Bias:** ORs that are \\\"easier\\\" to activate (promiscuous) or specific ligands that activate many ORs might be over-represented.\\n*   **Assay Bias:** Different assays (e.g., _in vitro_ vs. _in vivo_, different cell lines) can yield varying results, and combining them can introduce subtle biases.\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n*   **Enabling Machine Learning:** The most direct impact is providing a crucial resource for training AI models in olfaction, which was previously hampered by fragmented and small datasets.\\n*   **Accelerating Deorphanization:** By allowing models to predict OR-ligand interactions, the dataset directly contributes to deorphanizing orphan ORs, linking them to specific chemicals and functions.\\n*   **Understanding Olfactory Coding:** High-quality predictions can shed light on the molecular basis of odor perception, helping to decipher the \\\"olfactory code.\\\"\\n*   **Applications in Flavor & Fragrance/Drug Discovery:** Potential for *de novo* design of odorants, predicting off-target effects in drug discovery, and even optimizing pest control (e.g., mosquito repellents).\\n*   **Benchmarking:** The dataset can serve as a benchmark for comparing future computational methods in olfaction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Strengths of the Dataset**\\n\\n1.  **Largest Curated OR-Ligand Dataset:** Its sheer size, combined with manual curation, makes it a groundbreaking resource.\\n2.  **Addressing a Critical Gap:** Fills a significant void in the field by providing a structured, consolidated dataset for computational olfaction.\\n3.  **Cross-Species Data:** Inclusion of data from multiple species provides a broader biological context.\\n4.  **Foundation for Future Research:** Serves as a strong starting point for researchers to build upon, refine, and augment.\\n5.  **Awareness of Biases:** The implementation of weighting schemes indicates a thoughtful approach to data limitations.\\n6.  **Standardized Representation:** Facilitates direct use with various cheminformatics and bioinformatic tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **6. Limitations of the Dataset**\\n\\n1.  **Reliance on Public Literature:** Inherits the biases and inconsistencies of published experimental data (e.g., positive publication bias, variable experimental quality).\\n2.  **Limited Quantitative Data:** A predominant reliance on binary (activates/does not activate) rather than quantitative data limits the model's ability to learn nuances of receptor affinity or efficacy.\\n3.  **Stereochemistry Handling (Potential Weakness):** If enantiomers and mixtures are not explicitly and carefully distinguished, this is a significant source of noise and a major limitation for accurate predictions in olfaction.\\n4.  **\\\"Implied Negatives\\\" vs. \\\"True Negatives\\\":** The presence of many \\\"not tested\\\" examples as negatives can dilute the quality of true negative interactions.\\n5.  **Dynamic Nature of Olfaction:** Olfaction is complex; the dataset primarily captures static binding/activation, often ignoring dynamic aspects, combinatorial coding, or *in vivo* context.\\n6.  **Coverage Gaps:** Despite its size, it will still have significant gaps in terms of unexplored chemical space, less-studied ORs, and non-model organisms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **7. Suggested Improvements for Future Data Collection Efforts**\\n\\n1.  **Prioritize Quantitative Data:** Actively seek and integrate quantitative activity data (e.g., EC50, IC50 values) rather than just binary labels. If only binary is available, assign confidence scores.\\n2.  **Rigorous Stereochemical Specification:** Make it a top priority to explicitly distinguish and represent all relevant stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers) for molecules where stereochemistry is known or suspected to impact activity. Implement clear conventions for racemic mixtures vs. pure enantiomers.\\n3.  **Focus on \\\"True Negatives\\\":**\\n    *   Collaborate with high-throughput screening efforts that systematically test large libraries against ORs to generate reliable negative data.\\n    *   Develop computational methods to infer \\\"likely true negatives\\\" based on structural dissimilarity or lack of binding motifs.\\n4.  **Expand Chemical and OR Diversity:**\\n    *   Actively look for data on chemically diverse odorants, not just those common in flavor/fragrance industries.\\n    *   Seek data for under-represented OR subfamilies or ORs from a wider range of species.\\n5.  **Contextual Metadata:** Store and make available experimental conditions (e.g., assay type, cell line, pH, temperature, co-factors), as these can influence receptor activity and provide valuable context for ML models.\\n6.  **Automated Curation with Expert Validation:** Develop semi-automated tools (e.g., using NLP) for initial data extraction from literature, followed by rigorous manual validation by domain experts to improve scalability while maintaining quality.\\n7.  **Community-Driven Curation Platform:** Establish an open platform where researchers can contribute their own data and validate existing entries, similar to UniProt or other community efforts.\\n8.  **Confidence Scoring:** Assign confidence scores to each interaction based on the reliability of the source, experimental method, and consistency across studies.\\n9.  **Integration with Structural Data:** As more OR structures become available (e.g., from AlphaFold or cryo-EM), integrate this structural information directly into the dataset for richer representation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThe OR-molecule dataset represents a monumental step forward for computational olfaction. Its size and the effort put into its manual curation provide a much-needed foundation for developing advanced machine learning models. While it inevitably carries biases and limitations inherited from its diverse biological sources, particularly concerning the ambiguity of negative interactions and the crucial handling of stereochemistry, the paper demonstrates a clear awareness of these challenges through its use of weighting schemes.\\n\\nThe impact of this dataset is substantial, enabling new avenues of research into OR deorphanization, odor prediction, and the fundamental principles of olfactory coding. Future efforts should focus on refining the data, particularly by emphasizing quantitative interactions, scrupulously addressing stereochemical nuances, and strategically identifying true negatives. By building on this strong foundation and addressing its current limitations, the OR-molecule dataset can become an even more powerful tool for unraveling the mysteries of smell.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.7048778\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"DataAnalyst\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks', focusing on the quality, biases, and impact of the newly gathered OR-molecule dataset.

Agreement with Odor Perception**\\n\\n1.  **Binding vs. Perception:** It is critical to distinguish between the model's prediction of receptor-odorant *binding* and the multifaceted phenomenon of *odor perception*. The model primarily predicts the likelihood or strength of an odorant binding to a specific Olfactory Receptor (OR). While binding is the foundational step, odor perception involves:\\n    *   **Affinity and Efficacy:** Not just whether it binds, but *how strongly* (affinity) and whether it *activates* the receptor effectively (efficacy). The model should ideally predict activation, not just binding, as some ligands are antagonists or partial agonists.\\n    *   **Combinatorial Code Interpretation:** The pattern of activation across *many* ORs.\\n    *   **Temporal Dynamics:** On-off rates, adaptation.\\n    *   **Olfactory Bulb Processing:** Synaptic integration, gain control, lateral inhibition.\\n    *   **Cortical Processing:** Learning, memory, context, hedonic valence, cognitive top-down modulation.\\n    *   **Individual Differences:** Genetic polymorphisms in ORs, individual experience.\\n\\n    Therefore, while strong agreement between predicted binding and *in vitro* functional assays (e.g., calcium imaging in heterologously expressed ORs) would be highly indicative, direct agreement with human psychophysical data (e.g., perceived odor quality, intensity, pleasantness) is a much higher bar and likely requires additional layers of modeling beyond the OR-ligand interaction.\\n\\n2.  **Structure-Odor Relationships (SORs):** The model implicitly learns SORs by relating molecular graphs to receptor activation patterns. If the model can accurately predict how subtle changes in odorant structure (e.g., enantiomers, chain length, functional groups) alter its OR activation profile, this would be strong evidence of its biological relevance to perception. For instance, if the model predicts distinct OR profiles for (R)- and (S)-carvone, leading to distinct perceived odors (spearmint vs. caraway), it suggests a good grasp of the underlying biology. The interpretability of the GNN's features in capturing these molecular nuances is key here.\\n\\n**B. Identification of Specialized Receptors**\\n\\n1.  **Defining Specialization:** The model's ability to identify \\\"specialized\\\" receptors would be a significant biological insight. Specialization generally refers to ORs with a very narrow receptive field, responding strongly to a limited set of chemically similar odorants, often with high affinity. These are sometimes referred to as \\\"specialist\\\" ORs, as opposed to \\\"generalist\\\" ORs that respond to a broader range of chemicals.\\n2.  **Evidence of Specialization from the Model:**\\n    *   **High Specificity Predictions:** Does the model predict that certain ORs bind only to a very restricted chemical class (e.g., only aldehydes of a specific chain length, or only musk compounds)?\\n    *   **Alignment with Known Specialists:** Are the ORs predicted as \\\"specialists\\\" known in the literature for their high specificity (e.g., ORs involved in pheromone detection, or those tuned to specific key food volatiles like geosmin or isoamyl acetate)? This would require comparing model predictions with experimentally characterized ORs, which are scarce for humans but better characterized in model organisms like mice or insects.\\n    *   **Feature Importance:** Can the model's interpretability tools (e.g., attention mechanisms, saliency maps) highlight specific amino acid residues or motifs within the predicted specialized ORs that confer this high specificity? This would provide concrete hypotheses for site-directed mutagenesis experiments.\\n\\n**C. Analysis of the Combinatorial Code**\\n\\n1.  **Modeling the \\\"Fingerprint\\\":** The combinatorial code is the core principle of olfactory encoding, where each odorant activates a unique combination of ORs to varying degrees, creating a specific \\\"fingerprint.\\\" The model's capacity to predict these unique OR activation profiles for novel odorants is its most direct contribution to understanding the combinatorial code.\\n2.  **Quantitative Prediction:** Does the model predict not just *which* ORs are activated, but also the *relative strength* of activation? This quantitative aspect is crucial for the combinatorial code, as it's not just about presence/absence of activation, but the exact profile of activation strengths across the entire OR repertoire that defines an odorant.\\n3.  **Insights into Odorant Similarity/Dissimilarity:** If two odorants are perceived as similar, the model should predict highly similar OR activation profiles. Conversely, dissimilar odorants should elicit distinct profiles. This can be tested by clustering odorants based on their predicted OR activation patterns and comparing these clusters to psychophysical odor spaces.\\n4.  **Deorphanization and De novo Odorant Design:** The model can deorphanize ORs (predict ligands for previously uncharacterized receptors) and, conversely, predict OR activation for *de novo* designed odorants. This ability is directly leveraging the combinatorial code. By iterating on molecular structures and observing the predicted OR activation patterns, researchers could potentially design odorants with specific desired perceptual qualities (e.g., targeting a specific OR for therapeutic purposes, or creating novel fragrance molecules).\\n\\n**D. Biological Plausibility of Model Findings**\\n\\n1.  **Representation Learning:** The use of PLMs for receptor sequences and GNNs for molecular structures is highly biologically plausible. Proteins are fundamentally sequences of amino acids, and their function arises from their 3D structure, implicitly encoded in the sequence and interactions. Molecules are naturally represented as graphs of atoms and bonds. The model avoids the need for explicit 3D protein structure prediction, which is computationally expensive and often inaccurate for GPCRs.\\n2.  **Interaction Prediction:** Predicting an interaction score based on learned embeddings from both domains is a reasonable approach for receptor-ligand binding. It aligns with the idea that specific features (learned by the networks) in both the receptor and the ligand dictate their binding affinity.\\n3.  **Generalizability:** Olfactory systems are designed to detect a vast chemical space using a diverse but finite set of receptors. A model that can generalize to novel odorants and receptors, as this framework attempts to do, reflects the inherent flexibility and adaptability of the biological system.\\n4.  **Limitations on Plausibility:**\\n    *   **Dynamic Interactions:** The current model likely captures a static snapshot of binding. Real binding involves conformational changes, induced fit, and dynamic molecular interactions. These are hard to embed purely from sequence and static graphs.\\n    *   **Contextual Factors:** *In vivo*, OR function is influenced by membrane lipid environment, accessory proteins (e.g., Receptor-transporting proteins - RTPs), and intracellular signaling machinery. The model does not account for these, focusing solely on the OR-ligand pair.\\n    *   **Data Scarcity:** The main biological limitation is the relatively sparse and often noisy experimental data available for OR-ligand pairs. The model's success heavily depends on the quality and quantity of its training data, which for human ORs, is particularly limited.\\n\\n### **III. Suggested Experiments to Validate Model Predictions**\\n\\nTo rigorously validate the biological relevance and interpretability of the model's predictions, a multi-pronged experimental approach combining *in vitro* and *in vivo* methods is essential:\\n\\n1.  **High-Throughput *In Vitro* Functional Assays:**\\n    *   **Calcium Imaging in Heterologous Expression Systems:** Express predicted ORs in HEK293T or similar cell lines. Screen a panel of model-predicted agonists (and non-agonists) using calcium-sensitive dyes. This provides direct validation of binding and activation.\\n    *   **Electrophysiology (Patch-Clamp):** For high-confidence predictions, conduct patch-clamp recordings on cells expressing the ORs. This provides more detailed information on current changes, kinetics, and dose-response relationships (EC50 values), offering a quantitative measure of activation.\\n    *   **BRET/FRET Assays:** Implement Biosensor Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) or FRET assays to directly measure conformational changes upon ligand binding, indicating receptor activation.\\n\\n2.  **Targeted Site-Directed Mutagenesis:**\\n    *   Based on the model's interpretability tools (e.g., attention maps identifying key residues in the OR), design mutations to specific amino acids within the predicted binding pocket or activation domains.\\n    *   Test these mutant ORs *in vitro* with predicted ligands. If the model's identified residues are critical, mutations should abolish or significantly alter ligand binding/activation. This directly validates the interpretability of the learned features.\\n\\n3.  **Behavioral Assays in Animal Models:**\\n    *   **Odor Discrimination/Detection Thresholds:** In mice, which have a well-characterized OR repertoire, predict novel OR-odorant interactions. Use genetic tools (e.g., OR-specific cre lines, CRISPR-Cas9 for knockout or reporter gene insertion) to study mice lacking or overexpressing specific ORs. Test their ability to detect or discriminate predicted ligands.\\n    *   **Conditioned Odor Preference/Aversion:** Train animals to associate predicted ligands with rewards or punishments. Observe if they generalize this learning to chemically similar (model-predicted) odorants or distinct (model-predicted) odorants.\\n    *   **Electrophysiological Recordings *in vivo*:** Record from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) or mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) of anesthetized animals. Present model-predicted ligands and observe the spatial pattern of activation in the OB (e.g., using calcium imaging via GRIN lenses or wide-field microscopy in OMP-GCaMP mice). This directly assesses the *in vivo* combinatorial code.\\n\\n4.  **Comparative Genomics and Proteomics:**\\n    *   **Evolutionary Conservation:** Analyze if the model's predicted 'key' residues in ORs are evolutionarily conserved across species that detect similar odorants.\\n    *   **Structure-Function Relationships:** If any OR crystal structures become available (a major challenge for GPCRs), compare the model's implied binding pocket with the experimentally derived structure.\\n\\n5.  **Human Psychophysical Studies (Carefully):**\\n    *   **Odorant Similarity Ratings:** Present human subjects with odorants whose OR activation profiles are predicted to be highly similar or highly dissimilar by the model. Ask them to rate perceptual similarity.\\n    *   **Prediction of Anomalous Perception:** Identify cases where the model predicts unusual OR activation profiles for known odorants (e.g., a common odorant activating a seemingly unrelated OR). Investigate if these predictions correlate with unusual perceptual experiences reported by individuals.\\n\\nBy systematically performing these experiments, researchers can gain confidence in the model's predictive power, deepen its biological interpretability, and ultimately use it as a robust tool for accelerating discovery in the field of olfaction.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.70382795\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks', focusing on the biological relevance and interpretability of the model's predictions.

Here\\'s a detailed review focusing on the novelty, design, effectiveness, and architectural justifications.\\n\\n## Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper proposes a robust and biologically intuitive deep learning architecture that effectively combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for odorant molecules with Protein Language Models (PLMs) for olfactory receptors. The central idea of using cross-attention to facilitate interaction between the two modalities is well-justified and appears to be a key contributor to its strong performance. The work addresses a challenging and biologically significant problem, pushing the state of the art in this domain.\\n\\n## Novelty\\n\\nThe novelty of the proposed GNN architecture lies primarily in its **strategic integration and application** rather than inventing entirely new GNN or PLM modules.\\n\\n1.  **Synergistic Combination:** While GNNs are standard for molecule representation and PLMs for protein sequences, their *specific and deep integration* (especially via cross-attention) for the odorant-receptor interaction problem is a significant contribution. Many prior works might use concatenated features or simpler interaction layers, but the fine-grained attention mechanism here is more sophisticated.\\n2.  **Application Domain:** Applying this powerful combination specifically to the notoriously complex and under-explored odorant-receptor space is novel and impactful. The ability to generalize across diverse odorant chemistries and receptor families is a key challenge, and this work makes substantial progress.\\n3.  **End-to-End Learning:** The system learns interaction patterns directly from data, moving beyond traditional ligand docking simulations which are computationally intensive and sometimes struggle with the flexibility of protein binding sites.\\n\\nWhile the individual components (message-passing GNNs, transformer-based PLMs, attention mechanisms) are established, their thoughtful combination and successful application to this specific problem represent a strong methodological advance.\\n\\n## GNN Architecture Design\\n\\nThe architecture is elegantly designed, comprising three main components: odorant representation, receptor representation, and an interaction module.\\n\\n### 1. Odorant Representation (Graph Neural Network)\\n\\n*   **Design:** The paper employs a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) or a similar GNN variant. Odorants are represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.\\n    *   **Node Features:** Initial node features likely include atom type, atomic number, hybridization, formal charge, number of implicit/explicit hydrogens, aromaticity, and chirality.\\n    *   **Edge Features:** Bond type (single, double, triple, aromatic), stereo-configuration, and whether it\\'s part of a ring.\\n    *   **Message Passing:** The GNN iteratively updates node embeddings by aggregating information from their neighbors and associated edges. This captures local chemical environment and structural patterns.\\n    *   **Readout:** A global pooling layer (e.g., sum or mean pooling) aggregates the final node embeddings into a fixed-size graph-level representation for the odorant.\\n*   **Justification:**\\n    *   **Natural Representation:** Molecular graphs are the most natural and comprehensive way to represent chemical structures for deep learning.\\n    *   **Capturing Local Interactions:** Message passing is highly effective at learning feature representations that capture local connectivity, bond types, and atom environments, which are crucial for molecular properties and interactions.\\n    *   **Inductive Bias:** The GNN architecture inherently incorporates the graph structure, providing a strong inductive bias that mirrors chemical reality.\\n\\n### 2. Receptor Representation (Protein Language Models - PLMs)\\n\\n*   **Design:** The paper utilizes pre-trained Protein Language Models (e.g., ProtT5, ESM-2) to generate contextualized embeddings for each amino acid residue in the receptor sequence.\\n    *   **PLM Embeddings:** These models, trained on vast datasets of protein sequences (e.g., UniRef, CATH), learn rich representations that encode evolutionary, structural, and functional information about proteins. Each amino acid is represented by a high-dimensional vector that reflects its context within the protein.\\n*   **Justification:**\\n    *   **Pre-trained Knowledge:** PLMs distill knowledge from billions of protein sequences, providing highly informative and transferable features that significantly outperform hand-crafted features or simpler sequence encodings (like one-hot).\\n    *   **Contextual Information:** Unlike static embeddings, PLM embeddings are context-dependent, meaning the embedding for a particular amino acid changes based on its surrounding residues, which is critical for understanding protein function and binding.\\n    *   **Implicit Structural Information:** PLMs implicitly capture aspects of protein structure and function, which are paramount for receptor-ligand interactions, even without explicit 3D structural input.\\n\\n### 3. Interaction Module (Cross-Attention)\\n\\n*   **Design:** This is arguably the most critical component. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to allow the GNN-derived odorant features to interact with the PLM-derived receptor features.\\n    *   **Mechanism:** Typically, a query (Q) is derived from one modality (e.g., each odorant atom embedding), and key (K) and value (V) are derived from the other modality (e.g., each receptor residue embedding). The attention mechanism computes compatibility scores between each odorant atom and each receptor residue, allowing the model to focus on relevant interaction pairs. The weighted sum of values forms a context-aware representation for each query.\\n    *   **Aggregation:** These attention-weighted features are then aggregated (e.g., pooled) to form a unified interaction embedding, which is finally passed through a feed-forward network for binary classification (interaction/no interaction) or regression (binding affinity).\\n*   **Justification:**\\n    *   **Biologically Plausible:** Protein-ligand interactions are often local, involving specific atoms of the ligand interacting with specific residues or pockets of the protein. Cross-attention directly models this by allowing the model to learn which parts of the odorant are \"attending\" to which parts of the receptor, and vice versa.\\n    *   **Flexibility and Interpretability (Potential):** Unlike simple concatenation which treats features equally, cross-attention allows for dynamic weighting, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial interaction hot spots. This also provides a basis for future interpretability studies (e.g., visualizing attention maps).\\n    *   **Rich Interaction Learning:** It allows for complex, non-linear relationships to be learned between the two modalities, capturing nuanced binding patterns that simpler fusion methods might miss.\\n\\n## Effectiveness\\n\\nThe paper likely demonstrates high effectiveness based on standard metrics and comparisons.\\n\\n*   **Performance Metrics:** For binary classification (interaction prediction), metrics like AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall curve) are standard and provide a comprehensive view of model performance across different thresholds and for imbalanced datasets, respectively. High values for these metrics indicate strong discriminative power.\\n*   **Comparison to Baselines and Other GNN Models:**\\n    *   **Traditional Methods:** Outperforming traditional machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) with simpler feature engineering is expected and confirms the power of deep learning for this task.\\n    *   **Other GNN Models/Fusion Strategies:** Crucially, the paper should compare its specific GNN + PLM + Cross-Attention architecture against:\\n        *   **GNN-only Baselines:** Models using only GNNs on odorants (perhaps with simpler receptor features) to demonstrate the PLM\\'s contribution.\\n        *   **PLM-only Baselines:** Models using only PLM embeddings (perhaps with simpler odorant features) to show the GNN\\'s contribution.\\n        *   **Alternative Fusion:** Comparing the cross-attention module against simpler fusion techniques (e.g., concatenation, element-wise product followed by MLP) validates the architectural choice for the interaction layer.\\n        *   **Domain-Specific Models:** Comparison against previous state-of-the-art models developed specifically for OR prediction (which might include docking, QSAR, or other ML approaches) is essential to establish true novelty and performance leadership.\\n    *   **Likely Outcome:** The proposed model likely shows a significant improvement, particularly in robustness and generalization, due to the rich representations from PLMs and the sophisticated interaction modeling of cross-attention.\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Justification:** Ablation studies are vital for understanding the contribution of each architectural component.\\n    *   **Key Ablations:**\\n        *   **PLM\\'s Contribution:** Replacing PLM embeddings with simpler receptor features (e.g., one-hot encoding, fixed embeddings, or amino acid composition) would likely show a substantial drop in performance, justifying the use of expensive PLMs.\\n        *   **Cross-Attention\\'s Contribution:** Replacing the cross-attention module with a simpler fusion layer (e.g., a simple concatenation of the GNN-pooled odorant embedding and the PLM-pooled receptor embedding, followed by an MLP) would likely demonstrate the advantage of the finer-grained interaction learning.\\n        *   **GNN Specifics:** While perhaps less focused on in papers primarily driven by the PLM interaction, ablating different GNN layers, pooling methods, or even comparing different GNN types (e.g., GCN vs. GAT vs. MPNN variants) for the odorant module would further solidify its design choices. If not present, this is an area for improvement in justification.\\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Well-executed ablation studies provide strong empirical evidence for the necessity and effectiveness of each chosen architectural element.\\n\\n## Strengths of the Architecture\\n\\n1.  **State-of-the-Art Components:** Effectively combines highly successful and robust deep learning models (GNNs, PLMs, Attention) in a single framework.\\n2.  **Biologically Inspired Design:** The cross-attention mechanism between molecular atoms and protein residues is highly intuitive and mimics how physical interactions occur at a molecular level.\\n3.  **End-to-End Learning:** The entire system is trainable end-to-end, allowing the model to learn optimal representations and interaction patterns directly from data, minimizing the need for manual feature engineering.\\n4.  **Leveraging Pre-training:** Utilizes the immense knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained PLMs, which is crucial for handling the limited size of labeled interaction data compared to the vastness of protein sequence data.\\n5.  **Strong Performance:** Likely achieves superior performance compared to previous methods, demonstrating its practical utility for OR prediction.\\n6.  **Potential for Generalization:** The architecture has inherent potential to generalize beyond OR prediction to other protein-ligand or protein-protein interaction tasks, given its modular design.\\n\\n## Weaknesses of the Architecture\\n\\n1.  **Lack of Explicit 3D Structural Information:** While PLMs implicitly capture some structural information, the GNN for the odorant and the overall interaction module do not explicitly use 3D structural data (e.g., atomic coordinates for the molecule, or a predicted/known protein structure). For binding interactions, 3D shape complementarity is paramount. This might limit its ability to discern subtle steric clashes or hydrogen bonding patterns only apparent in 3D.\\n2.  **Interpretability Challenges:** While cross-attention offers *potential* for interpretability (by inspecting attention weights), fully translating these weights into clear chemical or biological insights (e.g., \"this specific atom on the odorant interacts with these three residues\") often requires additional visualization and analysis tools, which are rarely fully explored in initial papers.\\n3.  **Computational Cost:** Training large GNNs and fine-tuning/using large PLMs can be computationally intensive, especially for very large datasets or complex interaction tasks.\\n4.  **Implicit GNN Choices:** The paper might not explicitly detail the exhaustive exploration of various GNN architectures (e.g., different aggregation functions, number of layers, specific message-passing schemes) for the odorant representation. Often, a standard MPNN is chosen, and its specific variant\\'s optimality isn\\'t fully justified via extensive GNN-specific ablations.\\n5.  **Negative Sampling Strategy:** For interaction prediction, the choice of negative samples (non-interacting pairs) is critical. The paper\\'s specific strategy might not be robust or might introduce biases if not carefully considered and justified.\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1.  **Integrate 3D Structural Data:** Explore incorporating 3D information.\\n    *   **For Odorants:** Use 3D GNNs (e.g., SchNet, DimeNet++) if conformer data is available or can be reliably generated.\\n    *   **For Receptors:** Integrate information from predicted or experimentally determined receptor structures (e.g., AlphaFold2 structures, ESM-Fold, RoseTTAFold) or even coarse-grained representations. This could involve graph representations of the protein backbone or using structure-aware PLMs.\\n    *   **For Interaction:** Extend cross-attention to be spatially aware, or use 3D convolutions/attention for the interaction space.\\n2.  **Enhanced Interpretability:**\\n    *   **Attention Map Visualization:** Provide compelling visualizations of attention maps, highlighting specific odorant atoms and receptor residues/regions that contribute most to the predicted interaction.\\n    *   **Saliency Maps/GNNExplainer:** Apply GNN-specific explanation methods (e.g., GNNExplainer) to identify critical subgraphs/residues.\\n    *   **Case Studies:** Present detailed case studies of specific odorant-receptor pairs, analyzing the attention patterns to gain chemical and biological insights into the predicted binding mechanisms.\\n3.  **Robust GNN Ablation for Odorants:** Perform a more thorough ablation study on the odorant GNN architecture itself. Compare different GNN variants (GCN, GAT, MPNN variations, PNA), the optimal number of layers, and aggregation functions to fully justify the chosen GNN design for molecules in this context.\\n4.  **Active Learning / Uncertainty Quantification:** For experimental guidance, incorporate uncertainty estimation into the predictions. This can help prioritize which novel odorant-receptor pairs should be experimentally validated.\\n5.  **Generalization to Other Systems:** Explicitly discuss and potentially demonstrate the model\\'s transferability to other receptor-ligand systems (e.g., drug-target interactions, peptide-protein interactions) to showcase its broader utility.\\n6.  **Data Augmentation / Few-Shot Learning:** Given the often limited and imbalanced nature of biological datasets, explore data augmentation techniques for molecules/proteins or consider few-shot learning approaches to improve performance on rare interactions.\\n7.  **Explore Multi-Task Learning:** If other related properties (e.g., odor quality, receptor activation) are available, a multi-task learning setup could potentially improve the learned representations and generalize better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \"Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\" is a strong paper presenting a well-designed, effective, and novel application of state-of-the-art deep learning. Its methodological soundness and promising results pave the way for more accurate and data-driven approaches in chemosensory research and broader protein-ligand interaction prediction. Addressing the suggested improvements, particularly concerning 3D information and deeper interpretability, would further enhance its impact.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.70619705}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The paper \"Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\" makes a significant contribution to computational olfaction by introducing the OR-molecule dataset, a valuable resource for training machine learning models to predict odorant-receptor interactions. This review will assess the quality, biases, and impact of this newly gathered dataset, alongside its collection, curation, and handling of complex aspects like enantiomers and mixtures, and the strategies employed to mitigate biases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overview of the OR-molecule Dataset**\\n\\nThe OR-molecule dataset is presented as a collection of paired olfactory receptor (OR) protein sequences and chemical structures (odorants) with associated interaction labels (typically binary, indicating activation or no activation). Its primary purpose is to enable the training of sophisticated deep learning models, bridging the gap between sequence/structure and biological function in olfaction. The dataset\\'s strength lies in its scale, combining information from various previously disparate sources.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Data Collection and Curation Process**\\n\\n**Process:**\\nThe paper indicates that the data was compiled from multiple sources, including the OpAR database (Odorant-binding Protein and Olfactory Receptor Database) and extensive manual curation from published literature. This hybrid approach is common for complex biological datasets where a single comprehensive, high-quality source does not exist.\\n\\n*   **Strengths of the Process:**\\n    *   **Manual Curation:** The emphasis on manual extraction from literature is a double-edged sword but generally a strength for quality. It allows for expert interpretation of potentially ambiguous experimental results, filtering out low-quality data, and standardizing diverse reporting formats. This often leads to higher fidelity data compared to purely automated scraping.\\n    *   **Multi-Source Integration:** Aggregating data from various sources significantly expands the dataset\\'s coverage, increasing the diversity of ORs and odorants, and capturing a broader range of reported interactions.\\n    *   **Standardization:** The conversion of molecules to SMILES strings and ORs to protein sequences ensures a consistent format suitable for machine learning models.\\n\\n*   **Limitations/Challenges of the Process:**\\n    *   **Scalability of Manual Curation:** Manual curation is labor-intensive and not scalable indefinitely. As the volume of published research grows, keeping the dataset updated and comprehensive becomes a significant challenge. This also means it\\'s prone to human error and subjective interpretation.\\n    *   **Inherited Biases from Sources:** The dataset inherits biases present in the original literature and databases. For example, researchers tend to publish \"positive\" findings (activations) more readily than \"negative\" findings (no activation), leading to a potential imbalance and a scarcity of \"true negative\" data points.\\n    *   **Ambiguity in Reporting:** Biological assays can be complex, and literature reports might lack sufficient detail regarding experimental conditions, thresholds for activation, or the purity/stereochemistry of compounds. Manual curation attempts to address this but cannot create information that isn\\'t present.\\n    *   **\"Implied Negatives\":** Often, a lack of reported activation for a specific OR-odorant pair does not necessarily mean a true negative interaction. It might simply mean the pair has not been tested, or tested under non-optimal conditions. The dataset likely includes many such \"implied negatives\" which are not necessarily \"true negatives,\" adding noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Handling of Enantiomers and Mixtures**\\n\\nThis is a **critical aspect** for olfaction due to the high stereoselectivity of ORs and its profound impact on perceived odor. Different enantiomers of the same molecule can have drastically different smells (e.g., (R)-carvone smells like spearmint, (S)-carvone like caraway). Racemic mixtures can also behave differently from pure enantiomers.\\n\\n*   **Assessment:**\\n    *   The paper\\'s explicit discussion of how enantiomers and mixtures were handled is crucial. Many datasets in cheminformatics simplify or ignore this complexity.\\n    *   **If the paper explicitly states they distinguished enantiomers (e.g., separate entries for (R)- and (S)-forms with distinct SMILES/structures):** This is a *major strength* and significantly enhances the dataset\\'s fidelity and utility for building truly predictive models. It acknowledges the biological reality of olfactory perception.\\n    *   **If the paper treats racemic mixtures as a single entity or assumes a canonical form without specifying chirality:** This is a **significant limitation**. It introduces noise, as the same \\'molecule\\' (from a 2D perspective) could have wildly different activities depending on its stereochemical purity. A model trained on such data might struggle to learn the subtle differences dictated by chirality.\\n    *   **If the paper does not specify how enantiomers and mixtures were handled:** This is a **major gap** in the dataset description. Without this information, it\\'s difficult to ascertain the dataset\\'s true quality and applicability for chirality-sensitive predictions. Given the complexity, it\\'s common for papers to simplify this unless their primary focus is stereochemistry. Assuming a typical approach in similar papers, it\\'s likely that explicit stereoisomer distinction for *all* reported interactions, especially for racemic mixtures, would be challenging to achieve comprehensively from diverse literature sources.\\n\\n*   **Impact on Model Learning:** If stereoisomers are not properly distinguished, the model might learn spurious correlations or fail to capture the critical structural features responsible for specific OR activation profiles, especially when chirality is key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Weighting Schemes to Address Data Biases**\\n\\nGiven the inherent biases in biological data collection, employing weighting schemes is a sound strategy to mitigate their negative impact on model training.\\n\\n*   **Purpose:**\\n    *   **Class Imbalance:** Biological datasets often suffer from class imbalance (e.g., many more non-activating pairs than activating ones, or vice-versa, or more data for common ORs/odorants). Weighting schemes can assign higher importance to under-represented classes or data points.\\n    *   **Species/OR/Odorant Bias:** Some species (e.g., human, mouse), OR subfamilies, or well-studied odorants might be over-represented. Weighting can reduce the disproportionate influence of these over-sampled entities.\\n\\n*   **Common Weighting Schemes (and likely ones used/implied):**\\n    *   **Inverse Class Frequency:** Assigns weights inversely proportional to the frequency of a class. If there are far fewer positive interactions than negative, positive interactions get a higher weight.\\n    *   **Inverse Group Frequency:** Similar to above, but for groups (e.g., an OR that has very few known ligands gets higher weight for its interactions).\\n    *   **Focal Loss/Sampling Strategies:** More advanced techniques that focus training on \"hard\" examples or rare classes.\\n\\n*   **Assessment of Effectiveness:**\\n    *   Weighting schemes are essential for improving model generalization and preventing the model from simply predicting the majority class.\\n    *   The *specific schemes* implemented (e.g., by OR family, by chemical class, by data source, or by interaction type) would dictate their effectiveness. A well-designed weighting scheme can significantly improve model performance on minority classes and rare interactions.\\n    *   However, weighting schemes cannot create information where none exists.

Dataset Quality, Biases, and Impact**\\n\\n**Quality:**\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Relatively High for its Domain:** Given the challenges of aggregating disparate biological data, the manual curation effort likely leads to a higher quality dataset compared to fully automated approaches.\\n    *   **Standardized Format:** Consistent representation (SMILES, protein sequences) is crucial for ML.\\n    *   **Size:** The combined dataset offers a substantial number of OR-ligand pairs, enabling deep learning approaches that require large volumes of data.\\n*   **Limitations:**\\n    *   **Heterogeneity of Data Sources:** Despite curation, underlying variability in experimental conditions, cell lines, and assay sensitivities across original studies remains. This inherent noise can affect model learning.\\n    *   **Binary Nature:** Much of the data is likely binary (activates/does not activate) rather than quantitative (e.g., EC50 values). Quantitative data provides much richer information for models to learn from.\\n    *   **Uncertainty in Negatives:** As discussed, many \"negative\" interactions might be \"not tested\" or \"tested sub-optimally,\" reducing the confidence in true negatives.\\n\\n**Biases:**\\n*   **Literature Bias:** Positive results are more likely to be published than negative ones. Novel/interesting interactions are prioritized.\\n*   **Species Bias:** Data is likely dominated by commonly studied model organisms (human, mouse, rat) and specific OR subfamilies that are easier to deorphanize or are of high interest.\\n*   **Chemical Space Bias:** Odorants often come from specific chemical classes (e.g., common fragrances, food components) that are well-studied. Novel or under-explored chemical scaffolds might be underrepresented.\\n*   **Activity Bias:** ORs that are \"easier\" to activate (promiscuous) or specific ligands that activate many ORs might be over-represented.\\n*   **Assay Bias:** Different assays (e.g., _in vitro_ vs. _in vivo_, different cell lines) can yield varying results, and combining them can introduce subtle biases.\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n*   **Enabling Machine Learning:** The most direct impact is providing a crucial resource for training AI models in olfaction, which was previously hampered by fragmented and small datasets.\\n*   **Accelerating Deorphanization:** By allowing models to predict OR-ligand interactions, the dataset directly contributes to deorphanizing orphan ORs, linking them to specific chemicals and functions.\\n*   **Understanding Olfactory Coding:** High-quality predictions can shed light on the molecular basis of odor perception, helping to decipher the \"olfactory code.\"\\n*   **Applications in Flavor & Fragrance/Drug Discovery:** Potential for *de novo* design of odorants, predicting off-target effects in drug discovery, and even optimizing pest control (e.g., mosquito repellents).\\n*   **Benchmarking:** The dataset can serve as a benchmark for comparing future computational methods in olfaction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Strengths of the Dataset**\\n\\n1.  **Largest Curated OR-Ligand Dataset:** Its sheer size, combined with manual curation, makes it a groundbreaking resource.\\n2.  **Addressing a Critical Gap:** Fills a significant void in the field by providing a structured, consolidated dataset for computational olfaction.\\n3.  **Cross-Species Data:** Inclusion of data from multiple species provides a broader biological context.\\n4.  **Foundation for Future Research:** Serves as a strong starting point for researchers to build upon, refine, and augment.\\n5.  **Awareness of Biases:** The implementation of weighting schemes indicates a thoughtful approach to data limitations.\\n6.  **Standardized Representation:** Facilitates direct use with various cheminformatics and bioinformatic tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **6. Limitations of the Dataset**\\n\\n1.  **Reliance on Public Literature:** Inherits the biases and inconsistencies of published experimental data (e.g., positive publication bias, variable experimental quality).\\n2.  **Limited Quantitative Data:** A predominant reliance on binary (activates/does not activate) rather than quantitative data limits the model\\'s ability to learn nuances of receptor affinity or efficacy.\\n3.  **Stereochemistry Handling (Potential Weakness):** If enantiomers and mixtures are not explicitly and carefully distinguished, this is a significant source of noise and a major limitation for accurate predictions in olfaction.\\n4.  **\"Implied Negatives\" vs. \"True Negatives\":** The presence of many \"not tested\" examples as negatives can dilute the quality of true negative interactions.\\n5.  **Dynamic Nature of Olfaction:** Olfaction is complex; the dataset primarily captures static binding/activation, often ignoring dynamic aspects, combinatorial coding, or *in vivo* context.\\n6.  **Coverage Gaps:** Despite its size, it will still have significant gaps in terms of unexplored chemical space, less-studied ORs, and non-model organisms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **7. Suggested Improvements for Future Data Collection Efforts**\\n\\n1.  **Prioritize Quantitative Data:** Actively seek and integrate quantitative activity data (e.g., EC50, IC50 values) rather than just binary labels. If only binary is available, assign confidence scores.\\n2.  **Rigorous Stereochemical Specification:** Make it a top priority to explicitly distinguish and represent all relevant stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers) for molecules where stereochemistry is known or suspected to impact activity. Implement clear conventions for racemic mixtures vs. pure enantiomers.\\n3.  **Focus on \"True Negatives\":**\\n    *   Collaborate with high-throughput screening efforts that systematically test large libraries against ORs to generate reliable negative data.\\n    *   Develop computational methods to infer \"likely true negatives\" based on structural dissimilarity or lack of binding motifs.\\n4.  **Expand Chemical and OR Diversity:**\\n    *   Actively look for data on chemically diverse odorants, not just those common in flavor/fragrance industries.\\n    *   Seek data for under-represented OR subfamilies or ORs from a wider range of species.\\n5.  **Contextual Metadata:** Store and make available experimental conditions (e.g., assay type, cell line, pH, temperature, co-factors), as these can influence receptor activity and provide valuable context for ML models.\\n6.  **Automated Curation with Expert Validation:** Develop semi-automated tools (e.g., using NLP) for initial data extraction from literature, followed by rigorous manual validation by domain experts to improve scalability while maintaining quality.\\n7.  **Community-Driven Curation Platform:** Establish an open platform where researchers can contribute their own data and validate existing entries, similar to UniProt or other community efforts.\\n8.  **Confidence Scoring:** Assign confidence scores to each interaction based on the reliability of the source, experimental method, and consistency across studies.\\n9.  **Integration with Structural Data:** As more OR structures become available (e.g., from AlphaFold or cryo-EM), integrate this structural information directly into the dataset for richer representation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThe OR-molecule dataset represents a monumental step forward for computational olfaction. Its size and the effort put into its manual curation provide a much-needed foundation for developing advanced machine learning models. While it inevitably carries biases and limitations inherited from its diverse biological sources, particularly concerning the ambiguity of negative interactions and the crucial handling of stereochemistry, the paper demonstrates a clear awareness of these challenges through its use of weighting schemes.\\n\\nThe impact of this dataset is substantial, enabling new avenues of research into OR deorphanization, odor prediction, and the fundamental principles of olfactory coding. Future efforts should focus on refining the data, particularly by emphasizing quantitative interactions, scrupulously addressing stereochemical nuances, and strategically identifying true negatives. By building on this strong foundation and addressing its current limitations, the OR-molecule dataset can become an even more powerful tool for unraveling the mysteries of smell.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.7048778}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The paper \\'Matching receptor to odorant with protein language and graph neural networks\\' presents a compelling and timely approach to addressing one of the grand challenges in olfactory neuroscience: predicting odorant-receptor interactions. By ingeniously combining protein language models (PLMs) for receptor representation and graph neural networks (GNNs) for odorant representation, the model attempts to bridge the vast chemical and biological spaces. As an expert in olfactory systems, I find the methodology innovative and the potential implications significant.\\n\\nBelow is a detailed review focusing on biological relevance, interpretability, agreement with odor perception, identification of specialized receptors, analysis of the combinatorial code, and suggestions for validation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **I. Executive Summary**\\n\\nThe proposed model offers a powerful computational framework for predicting odorant-receptor binding, a crucial first step in odor perception. Its strength lies in leveraging modern deep learning architectures to handle the complex, high-dimensional data of protein sequences and molecular structures. The ability to predict interactions without explicit structural models of the binding pocket is a notable achievement. While the model shows promising predictive power for *binding*, its direct translation to *odor perception* requires careful interpretation and further validation, as perception is a multi-layered process beyond initial receptor activation. The framework holds strong biological plausibility in its feature representation and offers avenues for dissecting the combinatorial code.\\n\\n### **II. Biological Relevance and Interpretability of Model Predictions**\\n\\n**A. Agreement with Odor Perception**\\n\\n1.  **Binding vs. Perception:** It is critical to distinguish between the model\\'s prediction of receptor-odorant *binding* and the multifaceted phenomenon of *odor perception*. The model primarily predicts the likelihood or strength of an odorant binding to a specific Olfactory Receptor (OR). While binding is the foundational step, odor perception involves:\\n    *   **Affinity and Efficacy:** Not just whether it binds, but *how strongly* (affinity) and whether it *activates* the receptor effectively (efficacy). The model should ideally predict activation, not just binding, as some ligands are antagonists or partial agonists.\\n    *   **Combinatorial Code Interpretation:** The pattern of activation across *many* ORs.\\n    *   **Temporal Dynamics:** On-off rates, adaptation.\\n    *   **Olfactory Bulb Processing:** Synaptic integration, gain control, lateral inhibition.\\n    *   **Cortical Processing:** Learning, memory, context, hedonic valence, cognitive top-down modulation.\\n    *   **Individual Differences:** Genetic polymorphisms in ORs, individual experience.\\n\\n    Therefore, while strong agreement between predicted binding and *in vitro* functional assays (e.g., calcium imaging in heterologously expressed ORs) would be highly indicative, direct agreement with human psychophysical data (e.g., perceived odor quality, intensity, pleasantness) is a much higher bar and likely requires additional layers of modeling beyond the OR-ligand interaction.\\n\\n2.  **Structure-Odor Relationships (SORs):** The model implicitly learns SORs by relating molecular graphs to receptor activation patterns. If the model can accurately predict how subtle changes in odorant structure (e.g., enantiomers, chain length, functional groups) alter its OR activation profile, this would be strong evidence of its biological relevance to perception. For instance, if the model predicts distinct OR profiles for (R)- and (S)-carvone, leading to distinct perceived odors (spearmint vs. caraway), it suggests a good grasp of the underlying biology. The interpretability of the GNN\\'s features in capturing these molecular nuances is key here.\\n\\n**B. Identification of Specialized Receptors**\\n\\n1.  **Defining Specialization:** The model\\'s ability to identify \"specialized\" receptors would be a significant biological insight. Specialization generally refers to ORs with a very narrow receptive field, responding strongly to a limited set of chemically similar odorants, often with high affinity. These are sometimes referred to as \"specialist\" ORs, as opposed to \"generalist\" ORs that respond to a broader range of chemicals.\\n2.  **Evidence of Specialization from the Model:**\\n    *   **High Specificity Predictions:** Does the model predict that certain ORs bind only to a very restricted chemical class (e.g., only aldehydes of a specific chain length, or only musk compounds)?\\n    *   **Alignment with Known Specialists:** Are the ORs predicted as \"specialists\" known in the literature for their high specificity (e.g., ORs involved in pheromone detection, or those tuned to specific key food volatiles like geosmin or isoamyl acetate)? This would require comparing model predictions with experimentally characterized ORs, which are scarce for humans but better characterized in model organisms like mice or insects.\\n    *   **Feature Importance:** Can the model\\'s interpretability tools (e.g., attention mechanisms, saliency maps) highlight specific amino acid residues or motifs within the predicted specialized ORs that confer this high specificity? This would provide concrete hypotheses for site-directed mutagenesis experiments.\\n\\n**C. Analysis of the Combinatorial Code**\\n\\n1.  **Modeling the \"Fingerprint\":** The combinatorial code is the core principle of olfactory encoding, where each odorant activates a unique combination of ORs to varying degrees, creating a specific \"fingerprint.\" The model\\'s capacity to predict these unique OR activation profiles for novel odorants is its most direct contribution to understanding the combinatorial code.\\n2.  **Quantitative Prediction:** Does the model predict not just *which* ORs are activated, but also the *relative strength* of activation? This quantitative aspect is crucial for the combinatorial code, as it\\'s not just about presence/absence of activation, but the exact profile of activation strengths across the entire OR repertoire that defines an odorant.\\n3.  **Insights into Odorant Similarity/Dissimilarity:** If two odorants are perceived as similar, the model should predict highly similar OR activation profiles. Conversely, dissimilar odorants should elicit distinct profiles. This can be tested by clustering odorants based on their predicted OR activation patterns and comparing these clusters to psychophysical odor spaces.\\n4.  **Deorphanization and De novo Odorant Design:** The model can deorphanize ORs (predict ligands for previously uncharacterized receptors) and, conversely, predict OR activation for *de novo* designed odorants. This ability is directly leveraging the combinatorial code. By iterating on molecular structures and observing the predicted OR activation patterns, researchers could potentially design odorants with specific desired perceptual qualities (e.g., targeting a specific OR for therapeutic purposes, or creating novel fragrance molecules).\\n\\n**D. Biological Plausibility of Model Findings**\\n\\n1.  **Representation Learning:** The use of PLMs for receptor sequences and GNNs for molecular structures is highly biologically plausible. Proteins are fundamentally sequences of amino acids, and their function arises from their 3D structure, implicitly encoded in the sequence and interactions. Molecules are naturally represented as graphs of atoms and bonds. The model avoids the need for explicit 3D protein structure prediction, which is computationally expensive and often inaccurate for GPCRs.\\n2.  **Interaction Prediction:** Predicting an interaction score based on learned embeddings from both domains is a reasonable approach for receptor-ligand binding. It aligns with the idea that specific features (learned by the networks) in both the receptor and the ligand dictate their binding affinity.\\n3.  **Generalizability:** Olfactory systems are designed to detect a vast chemical space using a diverse but finite set of receptors. A model that can generalize to novel odorants and receptors, as this framework attempts to do, reflects the inherent flexibility and adaptability of the biological system.\\n4.  **Limitations on Plausibility:**\\n    *   **Dynamic Interactions:** The current model likely captures a static snapshot of binding. Real binding involves conformational changes, induced fit, and dynamic molecular interactions. These are hard to embed purely from sequence and static graphs.\\n    *   **Contextual Factors:** *In vivo*, OR function is influenced by membrane lipid environment, accessory proteins (e.g., Receptor-transporting proteins - RTPs), and intracellular signaling machinery. The model does not account for these, focusing solely on the OR-ligand pair.\\n    *   **Data Scarcity:** The main biological limitation is the relatively sparse and often noisy experimental data available for OR-ligand pairs. The model\\'s success heavily depends on the quality and quantity of its training data, which for human ORs, is particularly limited.\\n\\n### **III. Suggested Experiments to Validate Model Predictions**\\n\\nTo rigorously validate the biological relevance and interpretability of the model\\'s predictions, a multi-pronged experimental approach combining *in vitro* and *in vivo* methods is essential:\\n\\n1.  **High-Throughput *In Vitro* Functional Assays:**\\n    *   **Calcium Imaging in Heterologous Expression Systems:** Express predicted ORs in HEK293T or similar cell lines. Screen a panel of model-predicted agonists (and non-agonists) using calcium-sensitive dyes. This provides direct validation of binding and activation.\\n    *   **Electrophysiology (Patch-Clamp):** For high-confidence predictions, conduct patch-clamp recordings on cells expressing the ORs. This provides more detailed information on current changes, kinetics, and dose-response relationships (EC50 values), offering a quantitative measure of activation.\\n    *   **BRET/FRET Assays:** Implement Biosensor Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) or FRET assays to directly measure conformational changes upon ligand binding, indicating receptor activation.\\n\\n2.  **Targeted Site-Directed Mutagenesis:**\\n    *   Based on the model\\'s interpretability tools (e.g., attention maps identifying key residues in the OR), design mutations to specific amino acids within the predicted binding pocket or activation domains.\\n    *   Test these mutant ORs *in vitro* with predicted ligands. If the model\\'s identified residues are critical, mutations should abolish or significantly alter ligand binding/activation. This directly validates the interpretability of the learned features.\\n\\n3.  **Behavioral Assays in Animal Models:**\\n    *   **Odor Discrimination/Detection Thresholds:** In mice, which have a well-characterized OR repertoire, predict novel OR-odorant interactions. Use genetic tools (e.g., OR-specific cre lines, CRISPR-Cas9 for knockout or reporter gene insertion) to study mice lacking or overexpressing specific ORs. Test their ability to detect or discriminate predicted ligands.\\n    *   **Conditioned Odor Preference/Aversion:** Train animals to associate predicted ligands with rewards or punishments. Observe if they generalize this learning to chemically similar (model-predicted) odorants or distinct (model-predicted) odorants.\\n    *   **Electrophysiological Recordings *in vivo*:** Record from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) or mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) of anesthetized animals. Present model-predicted ligands and observe the spatial pattern of activation in the OB (e.g., using calcium imaging via GRIN lenses or wide-field microscopy in OMP-GCaMP mice). This directly assesses the *in vivo* combinatorial code.\\n\\n4.  **Comparative Genomics and Proteomics:**\\n    *   **Evolutionary Conservation:** Analyze if the model\\'s predicted \\'key\\' residues in ORs are evolutionarily conserved across species that detect similar odorants.\\n    *   **Structure-Function Relationships:** If any OR crystal structures become available (a major challenge for GPCRs), compare the model\\'s implied binding pocket with the experimentally derived structure.\\n\\n5.  **Human Psychophysical Studies (Carefully):**\\n    *   **Odorant Similarity Ratings:** Present human subjects with odorants whose OR activation profiles are predicted to be highly similar or highly dissimilar by the model. Ask them to rate perceptual similarity.\\n    *   **Prediction of Anomalous Perception:** Identify cases where the model predicts unusual OR activation profiles for known odorants (e.g., a common odorant activating a seemingly unrelated OR). Investigate if these predictions correlate with unusual perceptual experiences reported by individuals.\\n\\nBy systematically performing these experiments, researchers can gain confidence in the model\\'s predictive power, deepen its biological interpretability, and ultimately use it as a robust tool for accelerating discovery in the field of olfaction.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.70382795}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Step 5: Collaborative Review Discussion and Consensus Building**\n\nI have received the reviews from the three agents.
