The paper title is: On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Applying machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate optimization, also known as Learning to Optimize (L2O), is attracting increasing attention recently. It has been reported in the literature that L2O shows great potentials on both continuous optimization Monga et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2021); Amos (2022) and combinatorial optimization Bengio et al. (2021); Mazyavkina et al. (2021). Many of the L2O works train a parameterized model that takes the optimization problem as input and outputs information useful to the classic algorithms, such as a good initial solution and branching decisions Nair et al. (2020), and some even directly generate an approximate optimal solution Gregor & LeCun (2010). In these works, one is building an ML model to approximate the mapping from an explicit optimization instance either to its key properties or directly to its solution. The ability to achieve accurate approximation is called the representation power or expressive power of the model. When the approximation is accurate, the model can solve the problem or provide useful information to guide an optimization algorithm. This paper tries to address a fundamental but open theoretical problem for linear programming (LP): Which neural network can represent LP and predict its key properties and solution? (P0) To clarify, by solution we mean the optimal solution. We hope the answer to this question paves the way toward answering this question for other optimization types. Linear Programming (LP). LP is an important type of optimization problem with a wide range of applications, such as scheduling Hanssmann & Hess (1960), signal processing Candes & Tao (2005), machine learning Dedieu et al. (2022), etc. A general LP problem is defined as: min x\u2208Rn c\u22a4x, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u, (1.1) where A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, c \u2208 Rn, b \u2208 Rm, l \u2208 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e})n, u \u2208 (R \u222a {+\u221e})n, and \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=,\u2265}m. Any LP problems must follow one of the following three cases Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis: \u2022 Infeasible. The feasible set XF := {x \u2208 Rn : Ax \u25e6 b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u} is empty. In another word, there is no point in Rn that satisfies the constraints in LP (1.1). \u2022 Unbounded. The feasible set is non-empty, but the objective value can be arbitrarily good, i.e., unbounded from below. For any R > 0, there exists an x \u2208 XF such that c\u22a4x < \u2212R. \u2022 Feasible and bounded. There exists x\u2217 \u2208 XF such that c\u22a4x\u2217 \u2264 c\u22a4x for all x \u2208 XF . Such x\u2217 is named as an optimal solution, and c\u22a4x\u2217 is the optimal objective value. Thus, considering (P0), an ideal ML model is expected to be able to predict the three key characteristics of LP: feasibility, boundedness, and one of its optimal solutions (if exists), by taking the LP features (A, b, c, l, u, \u25e6) as input. Actually, such input has a strong mathematical structure. If we swap the positions of the i, j-th variable in (1.1), elements in vectors b, c, l, u, \u25e6 and columns of matrix A will be reordered. The reordered features (A\u0302, b, c\u0302, l\u0302, u\u0302, \u25e6\u0302) actually represent an exactly equivalent LP problem with the original one (A, b, c, l, u, \u25e6). Such property is named as permutation invariance. If we do not explicitly restrict ML models with a permutation invariant structure, the models may overfit to the variable/constraint orders of instances in the training set. Motivated by this point, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that are permutation invariant naturally. GNN in L2O. GNN is a type of neural networks defined on graphs and widely applied in many areas, for example, recommender systems, traffic, chemistry, etc Wu et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2020). Solving optimization problems with GNN is a recent arising topic in the literature Peng et al. (2021); Cappart et al. (2021). Many graph-related optimization problems, like minimum vertex cover, traveling salesman, vehicle routing, can be represented and solved approximately with GNNs due to their problem structures Khalil et al. (2017); Kool et al. (2019); Joshi et al. (2019); Drori et al. (2020). Besides that, one may solve a general LP or mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with the help of GNNs. Gasse et al. (2019) proposed to represent an MILP with a bipartite graph and apply a GNN on this graph to guide an MILP solver. Ding et al. (2020) proposed a tripartite graph to represent MILP. Since that, many approaches have been proposed to guide MILP or LP solvers with GNNs Nair et al. (2020); Gupta et al. (2020); Shen et al. (2021); Gupta et al. (2022); Khalil et al. (2022); Liu et al. (2022); Paulus et al. (2022); Qu et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022). Although encouraging empirical results have been observed, theoretical foundations are still lack for this approach. Specifying (P0), we ask: Are there GNNs that can predict the feasibility, boundedness and an optimal solution of LP? (P1) Related works and contributions. To answer (P1), one needs the theory of separation power and representation power. Separation power of a neural network (NN) means its ability to distinguish two different inputs. In our settings, a NN with strong separation power means that it can outputs different results when it is applied on any two different LPs. Representation power of NN means its ability to approximate functions of interest. The theory of representation power is established upon the separation power. Only functions with strong enough separation power may possess strong representation power. The power of GNN has been studied in the literature (see Sato (2020); Jegelka (2022); Li & Leskovec (2022) for comprehensive surveys), and some theoretical efforts have been made to represent some graph-related optimization problems with GNN Sato et al. (2019); Loukas (2020). However, there are still gaps to answer question (P1) since the relationships between characteristics of LP and properties of graphs are not well established. Our contributions are listed below: \u2022 (Separation Power). In the literature, it has been shown that the separation power of GNN is equal to the WL testXu et al. (2019); Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). However, there exist many pairs of LPs that cannot be distinguished by the WL test. We show that those puzzling LP pairs share the same feasibility, boundedness, and even an optimal solution if exists. Thus, GNN has strong enough separation power. \u2022 (Representation Power). To the best of our knowledge, we established the first complete proof that GNN can universally represent a broad class of LPs. More precisely, we prove that, there exist GNNs that can be arbitrarily close to the following three mappings: \u2013 LP \u2192 feasibility, \u2013 LP \u2192 optimal objective value (\u2212\u221e if unbounded and \u221e if infeasible), \u2013 LP \u2192 an optimal solution (if exists), although they are not continuous functions and cannot be covered by the literatureKeriven & Peyre\u0301 (2019); Chen et al. (2019); Maron et al. (2019a;b); Keriven et al. (2021). \u2022 (Experimental Validation). We design and conduct experiments that demonstrate the power of GNN on representing LP. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide preliminaries, including related notions, definitions and concepts. In Section 3, we present our main theoretical results. The sketches of proofs are provided in Section4. We validate our results with numerical experiments in Section 5 and we conclude this paper with Section 6. 2 PRELIMINARIES: In this section, we present concepts and definitions that will be used throughout this paper. We first describe how to represent an LP with a weighted bipartite graph, then we define GNN on those LP-induced graphs, and finally we further clarify question (P1) with strict mathematical definitions. 2.1 LP REPRESENTED AS WEIGHTED BIPARTITE GRAPH: Before representing LPs with graphs, we first define the graph that we will adopt in this paper: weighted bipartite graph. A weighted bipartite graph G = (V \u222a W,E) consists of a vertex set V \u222aW that are divided into two groups V and W with V \u2229W = \u2205, and a collection E of weighted edges, where each edge connects exactly one vertex in V and one vertex in W . Note that there is no edge connecting vertices in the same vertex group. E can also be viewed as a function E : V \u00d7W \u2192 R. We use Gm,n to denote the collection of all weighted bipartite graphs G = (V \u222aW,E) with |V | = m and |W | = n. We always write V = {v1, v2, . . . , vm}, W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}, and Ei,j = E(vi, wj), for i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . ,m}, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. One can equip each vertex with a feature vector. Throughout this paper, we denote hVi \u2208 HV as the feature vector of vertex vi \u2208 V and denote hWj \u2208 HW as the feature vector of vertex wj \u2208 W , where HV ,HW are feature spaces. Then we define HVm := (HV )m,HWn := (HW )n and concatenate all the vertex features together as H = (hV1 , h V 2 , . . . , h V m, h W 1 , h W 2 , . . . , h W n ) \u2208 HVm \u00d7HWn . Finally, a weighted bipartite graph with vertex features is defined as a tuple (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . With the concepts described above, one can represent an LP (1.1) as a bipartite graph Gasse et al. (2019). Each vertex in W represents a variable in LP and each vertex in V represents a constraint. The graph topology is defined with the matrix A in the linear constraint. More specifically, let us set \u2022 Vertex vi represents the i-th constraint in Ax \u25e6 b, and vertex wj represents the j-th variable xj . \u2022 Information of constraints is involved in the feature of vi: hVi = (bi, \u25e6i). \u2022 The space of constraint features is defined as HV := R\u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265}. \u2022 Information of variables is involved in the feature of wi: hWj = (cj , lj , uj). \u2022 The space of variable features is defined as HW := R\u00d7 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e})\u00d7 (R \u222a {+\u221e}). \u2022 The edge connecting vi and wj has weight Ei,j = Ai,j . Then an LP is represented as a graph (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n\u00d7HVm\u00d7HWn . In the rest of this paper, we coin such graphs as LP-induced Graphs or LP-Graphs for simplicity. We present an LP instance and its corresponding LP-graph in Figure 1. 2.2 GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS FOR LP: The GNNs in this paper always take an LP-Graph as input and the output has two cases: \u2022 The output is a single real number. In this case, GNN is a function Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R and usually used to predict the properties of the whole graph. \u2022 Each vertex in W has an output. Consequently, GNN is a function Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn \u2192 Rn. Since W represents variables in LP, GNN is used to predict properties of each variable in this case. Now we define the GNN structure precisely. First we encode the input features into the embedding space with learnable functions fVin : HV \u2192 Rd0 and fWin : HW \u2192 Rd0 : h0,Vi = f V in (h V i ), h 0,W j = f W in (h W j ), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (2.1) where h0,Vi , h 0,W j \u2208 Rd0 are initial embedded vertex features and d0 is their dimension. Then we choose learnable functions fVl , f W l : Rdl\u22121 \u2192 Rdl and gVl , gWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u2192 Rdl and update the hidden states with1: hl,Vi = g V l ( hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) ) , i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, (2.2) hl,Wj = g W l ( hl\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,jf V l (h l\u22121,V i ) ) , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (2.3) where hl,Vi , h l,W j \u2208 Rdl are vertex features at layer l (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) and their dimensions are d1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dL respectively. The output layer of the single-output GNN is defined with a learnable function fout : RdL \u00d7 RdL \u2192 R: yout = fout ( m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj ) . (2.4) The output of the vertex-output GNN is defined with fWout : RdL \u00d7 RdL \u00d7 RdL \u2192 R: yout(wj) = f W out ( m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj , h L,W j ) , j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. (2.5) We denote collections of single-output GNNs and vertex-output GNNs with FGNN and FWGNN, respectively: FGNN ={F : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R | F yields (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.4)}, FWGNN ={F : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 Rn | F yields (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.5)}. (2.6) In practice, all the learnable functions in GNN fVin , f W in , fout, f W out , {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0 are usually parameterized with multi-linear perceptrons (MLPs). In our theoretical analysis, we assume for simplicity that those functions may take all continuous functions on given domains, following the settings in (Azizian & Lelarge, 2021, Section C.1). Thanks to the universal approximation properties of MLP Hornik et al. (1989); Cybenko (1989), one can extend our theoretical results by taking those learnable functions as large enough MLPs. 2.3 REVISITING QUESTION (P1): With the definitions of LP-Graph and GNN above, we revisit the question (P1) and provide its precise mathematical description here. First we define three mappings that respectively describe the feasibility, optimal objective value and an optimal solution of an LP (if exists). Feasibility mapping The feasibility mapping is a classification function \u03a6feas : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 {0, 1}, (2.7) where \u03a6feas(G,H) = 1 if the LP associated with (G,H) is feasible and \u03a6feas(G,H) = 0 otherwise. 1Note that the update rules in (2.2) and (2.3) follow a message-passing way, where each vertex only collects information from its neighbors. Since Ei,j = 0 if there is no connection between vertices vi and wj , the sum operator in (2.2) can be rewritten as \u2211 j\u2208N (vi), where N (vi) denotes the set of neighbors of vertex vi. Optimal objective value mapping Denote \u03a6obj : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e,\u2212\u221e}, (2.8) as the optimal objective value mapping, i.e., for any (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , \u03a6obj(G,H) is the optimal objective value of the LP problem associated with (G,H). Remark 2.1. The optimal objective value of a LP problem can be a real number or \u221e/\u2212\u221e. The \u201c\u221e\u201d case corresponds to infeasible problems, while the \u201c\u2212\u221e\u201d case consists of LP problems whose objective function is unbounded from below in the feasible region. The preimage of all finite real numbers under \u03a6obj, \u03a6\u22121obj (R), actually describes all LPs with finite optimal objective value. Remark 2.2. In the case that a LP problem has finite optimal objective value, it is possible that the problem admits multiple optimal solutions. However, the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm must be unique. In fact, if x \u0338= x\u2032 are two different solutions with \u2225x\u2225 = \u2225x\u2032\u2225, where \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 denotes the \u21132-norm throughout this paper. Then 12 (x + x \u2032) is also an optimal solution due to the convexity of LPs, and it holds that \u2225 12 (x + x \u2032)\u22252 < 12\u2225x\u2225 2 + 12\u2225x \u2032\u22252 = \u2225x\u22252 = \u2225x\u2032\u22252, i.e., \u2225 12 (x+ x \u2032)\u2225 < \u2225x\u2225 = \u2225x\u2032\u2225, where the inequality is strict since x \u0338= x\u2032. Therefore, x and x\u2032 cannot be optimal solutions with the smallest \u21132-norm. Optimal solution mapping For any (G,H) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121obj (R), we have remarked before that the LP problem associated with (G,H) has a unique optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Let \u03a6solu : \u03a6 \u22121 obj (R) \u2192 R n, (2.9) be the mapping that maps (G,H) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) to the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Invariance and Equivariance We denote Sm, Sn as the group consisting of all permutations on vertex groups V,W respectively. In another word, Sm involves all permutations on the constraints of LP and Sn involves all permutations on the variables. In this paper, we say a function F : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R is invariant if it satisfies F (G,H) = F ((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H)) , \u2200\u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, and a function FW : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 Rn is equivariant if it satisfies \u03c3W (FW (G,H)) = FW ((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H))) , \u2200\u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, where (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H) is the permuted graph obtained from reordering indices in (G,H) using (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ), which is the group action of Sm \u00d7 Sn on Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . One can check that \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and any F \u2208 FGNN are invariant, and that \u03a6solu and any FW \u2208 FWGNN are equivariant. Question (P1) actually asks: Does there exist F \u2208 FGNN that well approximates \u03a6feas or \u03a6obj? And does there exist FW \u2208 FWGNN that well approximates \u03a6solu? 3 MAIN RESULTS: This section presents our main theorems that answer question (P1). As we state in the introduction, representation power is built upon separation power in our paper. We first present with the following theorem that GNN has strong enough separation power to represent LP. Theorem 3.1. Given any two LP instances (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , if F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) for all F \u2208 FGNN, then they share some common characteristics: (i) Both LP problems are feasible or both are infeasible, i.e., \u03a6feas(G,H) = \u03a6feas(G\u0302, H\u0302). (ii) The two LP problems have the same optimal objective value, i.e., \u03a6obj(G,H) = \u03a6obj(G\u0302, H\u0302). (iii) If both problems are feasible and bounded, then they have the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm, up to a permutation, i.e., \u03a6solu(G,H) = \u03c3W (\u03a6solu(G\u0302, H\u0302)) for some \u03c3W \u2208 Sn. Furthermore, if FW (G,H) = FW (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 FW \u2208 FWGNN, then (iii) holds without taking permutations, i.e., \u03a6solu(G,H) = \u03a6solu(G\u0302, H\u0302). This theorem demonstrates that the function spaces FGNN and FWGNN are rich enough to distinguish the characteristics of LP. Given two LP instances (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302), as long as their feasibility or boundedness are different, there must exist F \u2208 FGNN that can distinguish them: F (G,H) \u0338= F (G\u0302, H\u0302). Moreover, as long as their optimal solutions with the smallest \u21132-norm are different, there must exist FW \u2208 FWGNN that can distinguish them: FW (G,H) \u0338= FW (G\u0302, H\u0302). With Theorem 3.1 served as a foundation, we can prove that GNN can approximate the three mappings \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj and \u03a6solu to arbitrary precision. Before presenting those results, we first define some concepts of the space Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Topology and measure Throughout this paper, we consider Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , where HV = R \u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265} and HW = R \u00d7 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e}) \u00d7 (R \u222a {+\u221e}), as a topology space with product topology and a measurable space with product measure. It\u2019s enough to define the topology and measure of each part separately. Since each graph in this paper (without vertex features) can be represented with matrix A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, the graph space Gm,n is isomorphic to the Euclidean space Rm\u00d7n: Gm,n \u223c= Rm\u00d7n and we equip Gm,n with the standard Euclidean topology and the standard Lebesgue measure. The real spaces R in HW and HV are also equipped with the standard Euclidean topology and Lebesgue measure. All the discrete spaces {\u2264,=,\u2265}, {\u2212\u221e}, and {+\u221e} have the discrete topology, and all unions are disjoint unions. We equip those spaces with a discrete measure \u00b5(S) = |S|, where |S| is the number of elements in a finite set S. This finishes the whole definition and we denote Meas(\u00b7) as the measure on Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Theorem 3.2. Given any measurable X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite measure, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists some F \u2208 FGNN, such that Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X : IF (G,H)>1/2 \u0338= \u03a6feas(G,H) }) < \u03f5, where I\u00b7 is the indicator function, i.e., IF (G,H)>1/2 = 1 if F (G,H) > 1/2 and IF (G,H)>1/2 = 0 otherwise. This theorem shows that GNN is a good classifier for LP instances in X as long as X has finite measure. If we use F (G,H) > 1/2 as the criteria to predict the feasibility, the classification error rate is controlled by \u03f5/Meas(X), where \u03f5 can be arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we show that GNN can perfectly fit any dataset with finite samples, which is presented in the following corollary. Corollary 3.3. For any D \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite instances, there exists F \u2208 FGNN that IF (G,H)>1/2 = \u03a6feas(G,H), \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D. Besides the feasibility, GNN can also approximate \u03d5obj and \u03d5solu. Theorem 3.4. Given any measurable X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite measure, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F1 \u2208 FGNN such that Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X : IF1(G,H)>1/2 \u0338= I\u03a6obj(G,H)\u2208R }) < \u03f5, (3.1) and for any \u03f5, \u03b4 > 0, there exists F2 \u2208 FGNN such that Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) : |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| > \u03b4 }) < \u03f5. (3.2) Recall the definition of \u03a6obj in (2.8) that it can take {\u00b1\u221e} as its value. Thus, \u03a6obj(G,H) \u2208 R means the LP corresponding to (G,H) is feasible and bounded with a finite optimal objective value, and inequality (3.1) illustrates that GNN can identify those feasible and bounded LPs among the whole set X , up to a given precision \u03f5. Inequality (3.2) shows that GNN can also approximate the optimal value. The measure of the set of LP instances of which the optimal value cannot be approximated with \u03b4-precision is controlled by \u03f5. The following corollary gives the results on dataset with finite instances. Corollary 3.5. For any D \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite instances, there exists F1 \u2208 FGNN such that IF1(G,H)>1/2 = I\u03a6obj(G,H)\u2208R, \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D, and for any \u03b4 > 0, there exists F2 \u2208 FGNN, such that |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| < \u03b4, \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R). Finally, we show that GNN is able to represent the optimal solution mapping \u03a6solu. Theorem 3.6. Given any measurable X \u2282 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite measure, for any \u03f5, \u03b4 > 0, there exists some FW \u2208 FWGNN, such that Meas ({(G,H) \u2208 X : \u2225F (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 > \u03b4}) < \u03f5. Corollary 3.7. Given any D \u2282 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite instances, for any \u03b4 > 0, there exists FW \u2208 FWGNN, such that \u2225F (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 < \u03b4, \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D. 4 SKETCH OF PROOF: In this section, we will present a sketch of our proof lines and provide examples to show the intuitions. The full proof lines are presented in the appendix. Separation power Separation power of GNN is closely related to the graph isomorphism problem. To identify whether two given graphs are isomorphic, one may apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test Weisfeiler & Leman (1968), a widely studied method that can distinguish a broad class of graphs. It has been shown in the literature that the separation power of GNN is actually equal to the standard WL test (see e.g. Xu et al. (2019)). To apply the WL test on LP-graphs, we describe a modified WL test in Algorithm 1, that is slightly different from the standard WL test. Algorithm 1 The WL test for LP-Graphs2(denoted by WLLP) Require: A graph instance (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn and iteration limit L > 0. 1: Initialize with C0,Vi = HASH0,V (h V i ), C 0,W j = HASH0,W (h W j ). 2: for l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L do 3: Cl,Vi = HASHl,V ( Cl\u22121,Vi , \u2211n j=1 Ei,jHASH \u2032 l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj )) . 4: Cl,Wj = HASHl,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj , \u2211n i=1 Ei,jHASH \u2032 l,V ( Cl\u22121,Vi )) . 5: end for 6: return The multisets containing all colors {{CL,Vi }}mi=0, {{C L,W j }}nj=0. We denote Algorithm 1 by WLLP(\u00b7), and we say that two LP-graphs (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) can be distinguished by Algorithm 1 if and only if there exist a positive integer L and injective hash functions {HASHl,V ,HASHl,W }Ll=0 \u222a {HASH \u2032 l,V ,HASH \u2032 l,W }Ll=1 such that WLLP ( (G,H), L ) \u0338= WLLP ( (G\u0302, H\u0302), L ) . Unfortunately, there exist infinitely many pairs of non-isomorphic LP-graphs that cannot be distinguished by Algorithm 1. Figure 2 provide such an example. However, any two LP-graphs that cannot be distinguished by Algorithm 1 must share some common characteristics even if they are not isomorphic. For example, let us consider the six LP instances in Figure 2. In each of the three columns, the two non-isomorphic LP instances cannot be distinguished by the WL test. It can be checked that the two instances in the same column share some common characteristics. More specifically, both instances in the first column are infeasible; both instances in the second column are feasible but unbounded; both instances in the third column are feasible and bounded with (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2) being the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Actually, this phenomenon does not only happen on the instances in Figure 2, but also serves as an universal principle for all LP instances. We summarize the results in the following theorem: Theorem 4.1. If (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n\u00d7HVm\u00d7HWn are not distinguishable by Algorithm 1, then \u03a6feas(G,H) = \u03a6feas(G\u0302, H\u0302) and \u03a6obj(G,H) = \u03a6obj(G\u0302, H\u0302). Furthermore, if (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121obj (R), then it holds that \u03a6solu(G,H) = \u03c3W (\u03a6solu(G\u0302, H\u0302)) for some \u03c3W \u2208 Sn. 2In Algorithm 1, multisets, denoted by {{}}, are collections of elements that allow multiple appearance of the same element. Hash functions {HASHl,V ,HASHl,W }Ll=0 injectively map vertex information to vertex colors, while the others {HASH\u2032l,V ,HASH\u2032l,W }Ll=1 injectively map vertex colors to a linear space so that one can define sum and scalar multiplications on their outputs. 1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C l,W 4 for all l \u2265 0, whatever the hash functions are chosen. Based on this graph pair, we construct three pairs of LPs that are both infeasible, both unbounded, both feasible bounded with the same optimal solution, respectively. In other words, the above theorem guarantees the sufficient power of the WL test for separating LP problems with different characteristics, including feasibility, optimal objective value, and optimal solution with smallest \u21132-norm (up to permutation). This combined with the following theorem, which states the equivalence of the separation powers of the WL test and GNNs, yields that GNNs also have sufficient separation power for LP-graphs in the above sense. Theorem 4.2. For any (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , the followings are equivalent: (i) (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) are not distinguishable by Algorithm 1. (ii) F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 F \u2208 FGNN. (iii) For any FW \u2208 FWGNN, there exists \u03c3W \u2208 Sn such that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)). Theorem 4.2 extends the results in Xu et al. (2019); Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022) to the case with the modified WL test (Algorithm 1) and LP-graphs. Representation power Based on the separation power of GNNs, one is able to investigate the representation/approximation power of GNNs. To prove Theorems 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6, we first determine the closure of FGNN or FWGNN in the space of invariant/equivariant continuous functions with respect to the sup-norm, which is also named as the universal approximation. The result of FGNN is stated as follows, where C(X,R) is the collection/algebra of all real-valued continuous function on X . The result of FWGNN can be found in the appendix. Theorem 4.3. Let X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn be a compact set. For any \u03a6 \u2208 C(X,R) that satisfies \u03a6(G,H) = \u03a6(G\u0302, H\u0302) for all (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 X that are not distinguishable by Algorithm 1, and any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 FGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208X |\u03a6(G,H)\u2212 F (G,H)| < \u03f5. Theorem 4.3 can be viewed as an LP-graph version of results in Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). Roughly speaking, graph neural networks can approximate any invariant continuous function whose separation power is upper bounded by that of WL test on compact domain with arbitrarily small error. Although our target mappings \u03a6feas,\u03a6obj,\u03a6solu are not continuous, we prove (in appendix) that they are measurable. Applying Lusin\u2019s theorem (Evans & Garzepy, 2018, Theorem 1.14), we show that GNN can be arbitrarily close to the target mappings except for a small domain. 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS: We present the numerical results that validate our theoretical results in this section. We generate LP instances with m = 10 and n = 50 that are possibly infeasible or feasible and bounded. To check whether GNN can predict feasibility, we generate three data sets with 100, 500, 2500 independent LP instances respectively, and call the solver wrapped in scipy.optimize.linprog to get the feasibility, optimal objective value and an optimal solution for each generated LP. To generate enough feasible and bounded LPs to check whether GNN can approximate the optimal objective value and optimal solution, we follow the same approach as before to generate LP randomly and discard those infeasible LPs until the number of LPs reach our requirement. We train GNNs to fit the three LP characteristics by minimizing the distance between GNN-output and those solvergenerated labels. The building and the training of the GNNs are implemented using TensorFlow and the codes are modified from3 Gasse et al. (2019). We set L = 2 for all GNNs and those learnable functions fVin , f W in , fout, f W out , {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0 are all parameterized with MLPs. Details can be found in the appendix. Our results are reported in Figure 3. All the errors reported in Figure 3 are training errors since generalization is out of the scope of this paper. In Figure 3a, the \u201crate of errors\u201d means the proportion of instances with IF (G,H)>1/2 \u0338= \u03a6feas(G,H). This metric exactly equals to zeros as long as the number of parameters in GNN is large enough, which directly validates Corollary 3.3: the existence of GNNs that can accruately predict the feasibility of LP instances. With the three curves in Figure 3a combined together, we conclude that such principle does not violate as the number of samples increases. This consists with Theorem 3.2. Mean squared errors in Figures 3b and 3c are respectively defined as E(G,H)|F (G,H) \u2212 \u03a6feas(G,H)|2 and E(G,H)\u2225F (G,H) \u2212 \u03a6feas(G,H)\u22252. Therefore, Figures 3b and 3c validates Theorems 3.4 and 3.6 respectively. Note that all the instances used in Figure 3b are feasible and bounded. Thus, Figure 3b actually only validates (3.2) in Theorem 3.4. However, due to the fact that feasibility of an LP is equal to the boundedness of its dual problem, one may dualize each LP and use the conclusion of Figure 3a to validate (3.1) in Theorem 3.4. 6 CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we show that graph neural networks, as well as the WL test, have sufficient separation power to distinguish linear programming problems with different characteristics. In addition, GNNs can approximate LP feasibility, optimal objective value, and optimal solution with arbitrarily small errors on compact domains or finite datasets. These results guarantee that GNN is a proper class of machine learning models to represent linear programs, and hence contribute to the theoretical foundation in the learning-to-optimize community. Future directions include investing the representation power of graph neural networks for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which has been observed with promising experimental results in the literature. 3The codes are modified from https://github.com/ds4dm/learn2branch and we will release codes. A WEISFEILER-LEHMAN (WL) TEST AND COLOR REFINEMENT: The WL test can be viewed as a coloring refinement procedure if there are no collisions of hash functions and their weighted averages. More specifically, each vertex is colored initially according to the group it belongs to and its feature \u2013 two vertices have the same color if and only if they are in the same vertex group and have the same feature. The initial colors are denoted as C0,V1 , C 0,V 2 , . . . , C 0,V m , C 0,W 1 , C 0,W 2 , . . . , C 0,W n . Then at iteration l, the set of vertices with the same color at iteration l \u2212 1 are further partitioned into several subsets according to the colors of their neighbours \u2013 two vertices vi and vi\u2032 are in the same subset if and only if C l\u22121,V i = C l\u22121,V i\u2032 and for any C \u2208 {Cl\u22121,Wj : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n},\u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei,j = \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei\u2032,j , and it is similar for vertices wj and wj\u2032 . After such partition/refinement, vertices are associated with the same color if and only if they are in the same subset, which is the coloring at iteration l. This procedure is terminated if the refinement is trivial, meaning that no sets with the same color are partitioned into at least two subsets, i.e., the coloring is stable. For more information about color refinement, we refer to Berkholz et al. (2017); Arvind et al. (2015; 2017). We then discuss the stable coloring that Algorithm 1 will converge to, for which we made the following definition, where S = {S1, S2, . . . , Ss} is called a partition of a set S if S1\u222aS2\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aSs = S and Si \u2229 Si\u2032 = \u2205, \u2200 1 \u2264 i < i\u2032 \u2264 s. Definition A.1 (Stable Partition Pair of Vertices). Let G = (V \u222a W,E) be a weighted bipartite graph with V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}, and vertex features H = (hV1 , h V 2 , . . . , h V m, h W 1 , h W 2 , . . . , h W n ), and let I = {I1, I2, . . . , Is} and J = {J1, J2, . . . , Jt} be partitions of {1, 2, . . . ,m} and {1, 2, . . . , n}, respectively. We say that (I,J ) is a stable partition pair of vertices for the graph G if the followings are satisfied: (i) hVi = h V i\u2032 holds if i, i \u2032 \u2208 Ip for some p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}. (ii) hWj = h W j\u2032 holds if j, j \u2032 \u2208 Jq for some q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. (iii) For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}, q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, and i, i\u2032 \u2208 Ip, \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ei,j = \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ei\u2032,j . (iv) For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}, q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, and j, j\u2032 \u2208 Jq , \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ei,j = \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ei,j\u2032 . We denote (Il,J l) as the partition pair corresponding the coloring at iteration l of Algorithm 1. Suppose that there are no collisions. Then it is clear that (Il+1,J l+1) is finer than (Il,J l), denoted as (Il+1,J l+1) \u2aaf (Il,J l), which means that for any I \u2208 Il+1 and any J \u2208 J l+1, there exist I \u2032 \u2208 Il and J \u2032 \u2208 J l such that I \u2282 I \u2032 and J \u2282 J \u2032. In addition, (Il+1,J l+1) = (Il,J l) if and only if (Il,J l) is a stable partition pair of vertices. Note that there is at most O(|V | + |W |) iterations leading to strictly finer partition pair, i.e, (Il+1,J l+1) \u2aaf (Il,J l) but (Il+1,J l+1) \u0338= (Il,J l). We can immediately obtain the following result: Theorem A.2. If there are no collision of hash functions and their weighted averages, then Algorithm 1 terminates at a stable partition pair of vertices in O(|V |+ |W |) iterations. Furthermore, for every (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , the coarsest stable partition pair of vertices exists and is unique, which can be proved using techniques similar to the proof of (Berkholz et al., 2017, Proposition 3). Algorithm 1 terminates at the unique coarsest stable partition pair. This is because that the coloring gin each iteration of Algorithm 1 is always coarser than the unique coarsest stable partition pair (see (Berkholz et al., 2017, Proposition 2)). B SEPARATION POWER OF THE WL TEST: This section gives the proof and some corollaries of Theorem 4.1. First we present some definitions and lemmas, from which the proof of Theorem 4.1 can be immediately derived. Definition B.1. Given (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , we say that (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) can be distinguished by the WL test if there exists some L \u2208 N and some choices of hash functions, HASH0,V , HASH0,W , HASHl,V , HASHl,W , HASH\u2032l,V , and HASH \u2032 l,W , for l = 1, 2, . . . , L, such that the multisets of colors at the L-th iteration of the WL test are different for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302). Let \u223c be an equivalence relationship on Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn defined via: (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) if and only if they can not be distinguished by the WL test. It is clear that (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) if they are isometric, i.e., there exist two permutations, \u03c3V : {1, 2, . . . ,m} \u2192 {1, 2, . . . ,m} and \u03c3W : {1, 2, . . . , n} \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , n}, such that E\u03c3V (i),\u03c3W (j) = E\u0302i,j , hV\u03c3V (i) = h\u0302 V i , and h W \u03c3W (j) = h\u0302Wj , for any i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . ,m} and j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. However, not every pair of WL-indistinguishable graphs consists of isometric ones; see Figure 2 for an example. However, for LP problems that cannot be distinguished by the WL test will share some common properties, even if their associated graphs are not isomorphic. Lemma B.2. If two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems are indistinguishable by the WL test, then either both problems are feasible or both are infeasible. In other words, the WL test can distinguish two LP problems if one of them is feasible while the other one is infeasible. Proof of Lemma B.2. Let us consider two LP problems: min x\u2208Rn c\u22a4x, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u, (B.1) and min x\u2208Rn c\u0302\u22a4x, s.t. A\u0302x \u25e6\u0302 b\u0302, l\u0302 \u2264 x \u2264 u\u0302. (B.2) Let (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), where G = (V \u222a W,E) and G\u0302 = (V \u222a W, E\u0302), be the weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to (B.1) and (B.2), respectively. Since (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), for some choice of hash functions with no collision during Algorithm 1 for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), Theorem A.2 guarantees that Algorithm 1 outputs the same stable coloring for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) up to permutation. More specifically, after doing some permutation, there exist I = {I1, I2, . . . , Is} and J = {J1, J2, . . . , Jt} that are partitions of {1, 2, . . . ,m} and {1, 2, . . . , n}, respectively, such that the followings hold: \u2022 (bi, \u25e6i) = (b\u0302i, \u25e6\u0302i) and is independent of i \u2208 Ip, for any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}. \u2022 (lj , uj) = (l\u0302j , u\u0302j) and is independent of j \u2208 Jq for any q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. \u2022 For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s} and q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ai,j = \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j and is independent of i \u2208 Ip. \u2022 For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s} and q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j = \u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j and is independent of j \u2208 Jq . Suppose that the problem (B.1) is feasible with x \u2208 Rn be some point in the feasible region. Define y \u2208 Rt via yq = 1|Jq| \u2211 j\u2208Jq xj and x\u0302 \u2208 R n via x\u0302j = yq , j \u2208 Jq . Fix any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s} and some i0 \u2208 Ip. It holds for any i \u2208 Ip that n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj \u25e6i bi, i.e., t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ai,jxj \u25e6i0 bi0 , which implies that 1 |Ip| \u2211 i\u2208Ip t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ai,jxj = 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j xj \u25e6i0 bi0 . Notice that \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j is constant for j \u2208 Jq , \u2200 q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. Let us denote \u03b1q = \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j =\u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j for any j \u2208 Jq . Then it holds that 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u03b1qxj = 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u03b1qyq = 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j  yq \u25e6i0 bi0 . Note that 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j  yq = 1|Ip| \u2211 i\u2208Ip t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j  yq, and that \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j is constant for i \u2208 Ip. So one can conclude that n\u2211 j=1 A\u0302i,j x\u0302j = t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j x\u0302j = t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j  yq \u25e6i bi, \u2200 i \u2208 Ip, which leads to A\u0302x\u0302 \u25e6\u0302 b\u0302. It can also be seen that l\u0302 = l \u2264 x\u0302 \u2264 u \u2264 u\u0302. Therefore, x\u0302 is feasible for (B.2). We have shown above that the feasibility of (B.1) implies the feasibility of (B.2). The inverse is also true by the same reasoning. Hence, we complete the proof. Lemma B.3. If two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems are indistinguishable by the WL test, then these two problems share the same optimal objective value (could be \u221e or \u2212\u221e). Proof of Lemma B.3. If both problems are infeasible, then their optimal objective values are both \u221e. We then consider the case that both problems are feasible. We use the same setting and notations as in Lemma B.2, and in addition we have that cj = c\u0302j , which is part of hWj = h\u0302 W j , is independent of j \u2208 Jq for any q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. Suppose that x is an feasible solution to the problem (B.1) and let x\u0302 \u2208 Rn be defined via x\u0302j = 1|Jq| \u2211 j\u2032\u2208Jq xj\u2032 , j \u2208 Jq . It is guaranteed by the proof of Lemma B.2 that x\u0302 is a feasible solution to (B.2). One can also see that c\u22a4x = c\u0302\u22a4x\u0302. Since this holds for any feasible solution x to (B.1), the optimal value of the objective function for (B.2) is smaller than or equal to that for (B.1). The inverse is also true and the proof is completed. Lemma B.4. Suppose that two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems are indistinguishable by the WL test and the their optimal objective values are both finite. Then these two problems have the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm, up to permutation. Proof of Lemma B.4. We work with the same setting as in Lemma B.3, where permutations have already been applied. Let x and x\u2032 be the optimal solution to (B.1) and (B.2) with the smallest \u21132-norm, respectively. (Recall that the optimal solution to a LP problem with the smallest \u21132-norm is unique, see Remark 2.2.) Let x\u0302 \u2208 Rn be defined via x\u0302j = 1|Jq| \u2211 j\u2032\u2208Jq xj\u2032 for j \u2208 Jq , q = 1, 2, . . . , t. According to the arguments in the proof of Lemma B.2 and Lemma B.3, x\u0302 is an optimal solution to (B.2). The minimality of x\u2032 yields that \u2225x\u2032\u222522 \u2264 \u2225x\u0302\u222522 = t\u2211 q=1 |Jq|  1 |Jq| \u2211 j\u2208Jq xj 2 = t\u2211 q=1 1 |Jq| \u2211 j\u2208Jq xj 2 \u2264 t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq x2j = \u2225x\u222522, (B.3) which implies \u2225x\u2032\u2225 \u2264 \u2225x\u2225. The converse \u2225x\u2225 \u2264 \u2225x\u2032\u2225 is also true. Therefore, we must have \u2225x\u2225 = \u2225x\u2032\u2225 and hence, the inequalities in (B.3) must hold as equalities. Then one can conclude that xj = xj\u2032 for any j, j\u2032 \u2208 Jq and q = 1, 2, . . . , t, which leads to x = x\u0302. Furthermore, it follows from \u2225x\u2032\u2225 = \u2225x\u0302\u2225 and the uniqueness of x\u2032 (see Remark 2.2) that x\u2032 = x\u0302 = x, which completes the proof. One corollary one can see from the proof of Lemma B.4 is that the components of the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm must be the same if the two corresponding vertices have the same color in the WL test. Corollary B.5. Let (G,H) be a weighted bipartite graph with vertex features and let x be the optimal solution to the corresponding LP problem with the smallest \u21132-norm. Suppose that for some j, j\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, one has Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 for any l \u2208 N and any choices of hash functions, then xj = xj\u2032 . Let us also define another equivalence relationship on Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn where colors of w1, w2, . . . , wj with ordering (not just multisets) are considered: Definition B.6. Given (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) are not in the same equivalence class of W\u223c if and only if there exist some L \u2208 N and some hash functions HASH0,V , HASH0,W , HASHl,V , HASHl,W , HASH\u2032l,V , and HASH \u2032 l,W , l = 1, 2, . . . , L, such that {{CL,V1 , C L,V 2 , . . . , C L,V m }} \u0338= {{C\u0302 L,V 1 , C\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , C\u0302 L,V m }} or C l,W j \u0338= C\u0302 l,W j for some j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. It is clear that (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) implies (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). One can actually obtain a stronger version of Lemma B.4 given (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Corollary B.7. Suppose that two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems, (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), satisfies that (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Then these two problems have the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Proof of Corollary B.7. The proof of Lemma B.4 still applies with the difference that there is no permutation on {w1, w2, . . . , wn}. Proof of Theorem 4.1. The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows immediately from Lemmas B.2, B.3 and B.4. C SEPARATION POWER OF GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS: This section aims to prove Theorem 4.2, i.e., the separation power of GNNs is equivalent to that of the WL test. Similar results can be found in previous literature, see e.g. Xu et al. (2019); Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). We first introduce some lemmas that can directly imply Theorem 4.2. The lemma below, similar to (Xu et al., 2019, Lemma 2), states that the separation power of GNNs is at most that of the WL test. Lemma C.1. Let (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . If (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), then for any FW \u2208 FWGNN, there exists a permutation \u03c3W \u2208 Sn such that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)). Proof of Lemma C.1. First we describe the sketch of our proof. The assumption (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) implies that, if we apply the WL test on (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), the test results should be exactly the same whatever the hash functions in the WL test we choose. In the first step, we define a set of hash functions that are injective on all possible inputs. Second, we show that, if we apply an arbitrarily chosen GNN: FW \u2208 FWGNN on (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), the vertex features of the two graphs are exactly the same up to permutation, given the fact that the WL test results are the same. Finally, it concludes that FW (G,H) should be the same with FW (G\u0302, H\u0302) up to permutation. Let us first define hash functions. We choose HASH0,V and HASH0,W that are injective on the following sets (not multisets) respectively: {hV1 , . . . , hVm, h\u0302V1 , . . . , h\u0302Vm} and {hW1 , . . . , hWn , h\u0302W1 , . . . , h\u0302Wn }. Let {Cl\u22121,Vi }mi=1, {C l\u22121,W j }nj=1 and {C\u0302 l\u22121,V i }mi=1, {C\u0302 l\u22121,W j }nj=1 be the vertex colors in the (l\u22121)th iteration (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) in the WL test for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) respectively. Define two sets (not multisets) that collect different colors: CVl\u22121 = {C l\u22121,V 1 , . . . , C l\u22121,V m , C\u0302 l\u22121,V 1 , . . . , C\u0302 l\u22121,V m }, and CWl\u22121 = {C l\u22121,W 1 , . . . , C l\u22121,W n , C\u0302 l\u22121,W 1 , . . . , C\u0302 l\u22121,W n }. The hash function HASH\u2032l,V and HASH \u2032 l,W are chosen such that the outputs are located in some linear spaces and that {HASH\u2032l,V (C) : C \u2208 CVl\u22121} and {HASH \u2032 l,W (C) : C \u2208 CWl\u22121} are both linearly independent. Finally, we choose hash functions HASHl,V and HASHl,W such that HASHl,V is injective on the set (not multiset) Cl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  \u222a  C\u0302l\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( C\u0302l\u22121,Wj ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  , and that HASHl,W is injective on the set (not multiset){( Cl\u22121,Wj , n\u2211 i=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,V ( Cl\u22121,Vi )) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n } \u222a {( C\u0302l\u22121,Wj , n\u2211 i=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,V ( C\u0302l\u22121,Vi )) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n } . Those hash functions give the vertex colors at the next iteration (l-th layer): {Cl,Vi }mi=1, {C l,W j }nj=1 and {C\u0302l,Vi }mi=1, {C\u0302 l,W j }nj=1. Consider any FW \u2208 FWGNN and let {h l\u22121,V i }mi=1, {h l\u22121,W j }nj=1 and {h\u0302 l\u22121,V i }mi=1, {h\u0302 l\u22121,W j }nj=1 be the vertex features in the l-th layer (0 \u2264 l \u2264 L) of the graph neural network FW . (Update rule refers to equations (2.1),(2.2),(2.3),(2.5)) We aim to prove by induction that for any l \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , L}, the followings hold: (i) Cl,Vi = C l,V i\u2032 implies h l,V i = h l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (ii) C\u0302l,Vi = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies h\u0302 l,V i = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iii) Cl,Vi = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies h l,V i = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iv) Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 implies h l,W j = h l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (v) C\u0302l,Wj = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies h\u0302 l,W j = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (vi) Cl,Wj = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies h l,W j = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n. The above claims (i)-(vi) are clearly true for l = 0 due to the injectivity of HASH0,V and HASH0,W . Now we assume that (i)-(vi) are true for some l\u22121 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , L\u22121}. Suppose that Cl,Vi = C l,V i\u2032 , i.e., HASHl,V Cl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) = HASHl,V Cl\u22121,Vi\u2032 , n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) , for some 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m. It follows from the injectivity of HASHl,V that Cl\u22121,Vi = C l\u22121,V i\u2032 , (C.1) and n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) = n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) . According to the linearly independent property of HASH\u2032l,W , the above equation implies that\u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei,j = \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei\u2032,j , \u2200 C \u2208 CWl\u22121. (C.2) Note that the induction assumption guarantees that hl\u22121,Wj = h l\u22121,W j\u2032 as long as C l\u22121,W j = C l\u22121,W j\u2032 . So one can assign for each C \u2208 CWl\u22121 some h(C) \u2208 Rdl\u22121 such that h l\u22121,W j = h(C) as long as Cl\u22121,Wj = C for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Therefore, it follows from (C.2) that n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) = \u2211 C\u2208CWl\u22121 \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei,jf W l (h(C)) = \u2211 C\u2208CWl\u22121 \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei\u2032,jf W l (h(C)) = n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ). Note also that (C.1) and the induction assumption lead to hl\u22121,Vi = h l\u22121,V i\u2032 . Then one can conclude that hl,Vi = g V l hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  = gVl hl\u22121,Vi\u2032 , n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  = hl,Vi\u2032 . This proves the claim (i) for l. The other five claims can be proved using similar arguments. Therefore, we obtain from (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) that{{ hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m }} = {{ h\u0302L,V1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m }} , and that {{ hL,W1 , h L,W 2 , . . . , h L,W n }} = {{ h\u0302L,W1 , h\u0302 L,W 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,W n }} . By the definition of the output layer, the above conclusion guarantees that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)) for some \u03c3W \u2208 Sn. Lemma C.2. Let (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn . Suppose that for any FW \u2208 FWGNN, there exists a permutation \u03c3W \u2208 Sn such that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)). Then F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for any F \u2208 FGNN. Proof of Lemma C.2. Pick an arbitrary F \u2208 FGNN. We choose FW \u2208 FWGNN such that FW (G \u2032, H \u2032) = (F (G\u2032, H \u2032), . . . , F (G\u2032, H \u2032)) \u22a4 \u2208 Rn, \u2200 (G\u2032, H \u2032) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Note that every entry in the output of FW is equal to the output of F . Thus, it follows from FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)) that F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302). The next lemma is similar to (Xu et al., 2019, Theorem 3) and states that the separation power of GNNs is at least that of the WL test. Lemma C.3. Let (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn . If F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for any F \u2208 FGNN, then (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Proof of Lemma C.3. It suffices to prove that, if (G,H) can be distinguished from (G\u0302, H\u0302) by the WL test, then there exists F \u2208 FGNN, such that F (G,H) \u0338= F (G\u0302, H\u0302). The distinguish-ability of the WL test implies that there exists L \u2208 N and hash functions, HASH0,V , HASH0,W , HASHl,V , HASHl,W , HASH\u2032l,V , and HASH \u2032 l,W , for l = 1, 2, . . . , L, such that{{ CL,V1 , C L,V 2 , . . . , C L,V m }} \u0338= {{ C\u0302L,V1 , C\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , C\u0302 L,V m }} , (C.3) or {{ CL,W1 , C L,W 2 , . . . , C L,W n }} \u0338= {{ C\u0302L,W1 , C\u0302 L,W 2 , . . . , C\u0302 L,W n }} , (C.4) We aim to construct some GNNs such that the followings hold for any l = 0, 1, . . . , L: (i) hl,Vi = h l,V i\u2032 implies C l,V i = C l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (ii) h\u0302l,Vi = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies C\u0302 l,V i = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iii) hl,Vi = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies C l,V i = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iv) hl,Wj = h l,W j\u2032 implies C l,W j = C l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (v) h\u0302l,Wj = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies C\u0302 l,W j = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (vi) hl,Wj = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies C l,W j = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n. It is clear that the above conditions (i)-(vi) hold for l = 0 as long as we choose fVin and f W in that are injective on the following two sets (not multisets) respectively: {hV1 , . . . , hVm, h\u0302V1 , . . . , h\u0302Vm} and {hW1 , . . . , hWn , h\u0302W1 , . . . , h\u0302Wn }. We then assume that (i)-(vi) hold for some 0 \u2264 l \u2212 1 < L, and show that these conditions are also satisfied for l if we choose fVl , f W l , g V i , g W l properly. Let us consider the set (not multiset): {\u03b11, \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1s} \u2282 Rdl\u22121 that collects all different values in hl\u22121,W1 , h l\u22121,W 2 , . . . , h l\u22121,W n , h\u0302 l\u22121,W 1 , h\u0302 l\u22121,W 2 , . . . , h\u0302 l\u22121,W n . Let dl \u2265 s and let edlp = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) be the vector in Rdl with the p-th entry being 1 and all other entries being 0, for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 s. Choose fWl : Rdl\u22121 \u2192 Rdl as a continuous function satisfying fWl (\u03b1p) = e dl p , p = 1, 2, . . . , s, and choose g V l : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u2192 Rdl that is continuous and is injective when restricted on the set (not multiset) hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  \u222a  h\u0302l\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 E\u0302i,jf W l (h\u0302 l\u22121,W j )  : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  . Noticing that n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) = s\u2211 p=1  \u2211 hl\u22121,Wj =\u03b1p Ei,j  edlp , and that {edl1 , e dl 2 , . . . , e dl s } is linearly independent, one can conclude that h l,V i = h l,V i\u2032 if and only if hl\u22121,Vi = h l\u22121,V i\u2032 and \u2211n j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) = \u2211n j=1 Ei\u2032,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ), where the second condition is equivalent to\u2211 hl\u22121,Wj =\u03b1p Ei,j = \u2211 hl\u22121,Wj =\u03b1p Ei\u2032,j , \u2200 p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}. This, as well as the condition (iv) for l \u2212 1, implies that n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) = n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) , and hence that Cl,Vi = C l,V i\u2032 by using h l\u22121,V i = h l\u22121,V i and condition (i) for l \u2212 1. Therefore, we know that (i) is satisfied for l, and one can show (ii) and (iii) for l using similar arguments by taking dl large enough. In addition, fVl and g W l can also be chosen in a similar way such that (iv)-(vi) are satisfied for l. Combining (C.3), (C.4), and condition (i)-(iv) for L, we obtain that{{ hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m }} \u0338= {{ h\u0302L,V1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m }} , (C.5) or {{ hL,W1 , h L,W 2 , . . . , h L,W n }} \u0338= {{ h\u0302L,W1 , h\u0302 L,W 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,W n }} . Without loss of generality, we can assume that (C.5) holds. Consider the set (not multiset) {\u03b21, \u03b22, . . . , \u03b2t} \u2282 RdL , that collects all different values in hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m , h\u0302 L,V 1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m . Let k > 1 be a positive integer that is greater than the maximal multiplicity of an element in the multisets {{hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m }} and {{h\u0302 L,V 1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m }}. There exists a continuous function \u03c6 : RdL \u2192 R such that \u03c6(\u03b2q) = kq for q = 1, 2, . . . , t, and due to (C.5) and the fact that the way of writing an integer as k-ary expression is unique, it hence holds that m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(hL,Vi ) \u0338= m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(h\u0302L,Vi ). Set the dimension of (L + 1)-th layer as 1: dL+1 = 1, and set fL+1,V = 0, fL+1,W = 0, gL+1,V (h, 0) = \u03c6(h), and gL+1,W = 0. Then we have h L+1,V i = \u03c6(h L,V i ), h\u0302 L+1,V i = \u03c6(h\u0302 L,V i ), and hL+1,Wj = h\u0302 L+1,W j for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m and j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. Define fout : R \u00d7 R \u2192 R via fout(h, h \u2032) = h. Then it follows that fout  m\u2211 i=1 hL+1,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL+1,Wj  = m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(hL,Vi ) \u0338= m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(h\u0302L,Vi ) = fout  m\u2211 i=1 h\u0302L+1,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 h\u0302L+1,Wj  , which guarantees the existence of F \u2208 FGNN that has L + 1 layers and satisfies F (G,H) \u0338= F (G\u0302, H\u0302). Proof of Theorem 4.2. The equivalence of the three conditions follow immediately from Lemma C.1, C.2, and C.3. Corollary C.4. For any two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , the followings are equivalent: (i) (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). (ii) For any FW \u2208 FWGNN, it holds that FW (G,H) = FW (G\u0302, H\u0302). Proof of Corollary C.4. The proof follows similar lines as in the proof of Theorem 4.2 with the difference that there is no permutation on {w1, w2, . . . , wn}. In addition to the separation power of GNNs for two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features, one can also obtain results on separating different vertices in one weighted bipartite graph with vertex features. Corollary C.5. For any weighted bipartite graph with vertex features (G,H) and any j, j\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the followings are equivalent: (i) Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 holds for any l \u2208 N and any choice of hash functions. (ii) FW (G,H)j = FW (G,H)j\u2032 , \u2200 FW \u2208 FWGNN. Proof of Corollary C.5. \u201c(i) =\u21d2 (ii)\u201d and \u201c(ii) =\u21d2 (i)\u201d can be proved using similar arguments in the proof of Lemma C.1 and Lemma C.3, respectively. D UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION OF FGNN This section provides the proof of Theorem 4.3. The main mathematical tool used in the proof is the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem: Theorem D.1 (Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (Rudin, 1991, Section 5.7)). Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and let F \u2282 C(X,R) be a subalgebra. If F separates points on X , i.e., for any x, x\u2032 \u2208 X with x \u0338= x\u2032, there exists F \u2208 F such that F (x) \u0338= F (x\u2032), and 1 \u2208 F , then F is dense in C(X,R) with the topology of uniform convergence. Proof of Theorem 4.3. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 X/ \u223c be the quotient map, where \u03c0(X) = X/ \u223c is equipped with the quotient topology. For any F \u2208 FGNN, since F : X \u2192 R is continuous and by Theorem 4.2, F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), there exists a unique continuous F\u0303 : \u03c0(X) \u2192 R such that F = F\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c0. Set F\u0303GNN = { F\u0303 : F \u2208 FGNN } \u2282 C(\u03c0(X),R). In addition, the assumption on \u03a6, i.e, \u03a6(G,H) = \u03a6(G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), leads to the existence of a unique \u03a6\u0303 \u2208 C(\u03c0(X),R) with \u03a6 = \u03a6\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c0. Since X is compact, then \u03c0(X) is also compact due to the continuity of \u03c0. According to Lemma D.2 below, F\u0303GNN is a subalgebra of C(\u03c0(X),R). By Theorem 4.2, F\u0303GNN separates points on \u03c0(X). This can further imply that \u03c0(X) is Hausdorff. In fact, for any x, x\u2032 \u2208 \u03c0(X), there exists F\u0303 \u2208 F\u0303GNN with F\u0303 (x) \u0338= F\u0303 (x\u2032). Without loss of generality, we assume that F\u0303 (x) < F\u0303 (x\u2032) and choose some c \u2208 R with F\u0303 (x) < c < F\u0303 (x\u2032). By continuity of F\u0303 , we know that F\u0303\u22121((\u2212\u221e, c)) \u2229 \u03c0(X) and F\u0303\u22121((c,+\u221e)) \u2229 \u03c0(X) are disjoint open subsets of \u03c0(X) with x \u2208 F\u0303\u22121((\u2212\u221e, c)) \u2229 \u03c0(X) and x\u2032 \u2208 F\u0303\u22121((c,+\u221e)) \u2229 \u03c0(X), which leads to the Hausdorff property of \u03c0(X). Note also that 1 \u2208 F\u0303GNN. Using Theorem D.1, we can conclude the denseness of F\u0303GNN in C(\u03c0(X),R). Therefore, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 FGNN, such that sup (G,H)\u2208X |\u03a6(G,H)\u2212 F (G,H)| = sup x\u2208\u03c0(X) |\u03a6\u0303(x)\u2212 F\u0303 (x)| < \u03f5, which completes the proof. Lemma D.2. FGNN is a subalgebra of C(Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn ,R), and as a corollary, F\u0303GNN is a subalgebra of C(Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn / \u223c,R). Proof of Lemma D.2. It suffices to show that FGNN is closed under addition and multiplication. Consider any F, F\u0302 \u2208 FGNN. Thanks to Lemma D.3, we can assume that both F and F\u0302 have L layers. Suppose that F is constructed by fVin : HV \u2192 Rd0 , fWin : HW \u2192 Rd0 , fVl , f W l : Rdl\u22121 \u2192 Rdl , gVl , gWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u2192 Rdl , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 L, fout : RdL \u00d7 RdL \u2192 R, and that F\u0302 is constructed by f\u0302Vin : HV \u2192 Rd\u03020 , f\u0302Win : HW \u2192 Rd\u03020 , f\u0302Vl , f\u0302 W l : Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u2192 Rd\u0302l , g\u0302Vl , g\u0302Wl : Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l \u2192 Rd\u0302l , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 L, f\u0302out : Rd\u0302L \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u2192 R. One can then construct two new GNNs computing F + F\u0302 and F \u00b7 F\u0302 as follows: The input layer The update rule of the input layer is defined by fVin : HV \u2192 Rd0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , h 7\u2192 ( fVin (h), f\u0302 V in (h) ) , fWin : HW \u2192 Rd0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , h 7\u2192 ( fWin (h), f\u0302 W in (h) ) . Then the vertex features after the computation of the input layer h0,Vi and h 0,W j are given by: h0,Vi = f V in (h V i ) = ( fVin (h V i ), f\u0302 V in (h V i ) ) = (h0,Vi , h\u0302 0,V i ) \u2208 R d0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , h0,Wj = f W in (h W j ) = ( fWin (h W j ), f\u0302 W in (h W j ) ) = (h0,Wj , h\u0302 0,W j ) \u2208 R d0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , for i = 1, 2 . . . ,m, and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The l-th layer (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) . We set fVl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302) 7\u2192 ( fVl (h), f\u0302 V l (h\u0302) ) , fWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302) 7\u2192 ( fWl (h), f\u0302 W l (h\u0302) ) , gVl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302, h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032) 7\u2192 ( gWl (h, h \u2032), g\u0302Wl (h\u0302, h\u0302 \u2032) ) , and gWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302, h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032) 7\u2192 ( gVl (h, h \u2032), g\u0302Vl (h\u0302, h\u0302 \u2032) ) . Then the vertex features after the computation of the l-th layer hl,Vi and h l,W j are given by: hl,Vi = g V l hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  = gVl hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  , g\u0302Vl h\u0302l\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,j f\u0302 W l (h\u0302 l\u22121,W j )  = (hl,Vi , h\u0302 l,V i ) \u2208 R dl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , and hl,Wj = g W l ( hl\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,jf V l (h l\u22121,V i ) ) = ( gWl ( hl\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,jf V l (h l\u22121,V i ) ) , g\u0302Wl ( h\u0302l\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,j f\u0302 V l (h\u0302 l\u22121,V i ) )) = (hl,Wj , h\u0302 l,W j ) \u2208 R dl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , for i = 1, 2 . . . ,m, and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The output layer To obtain F + F\u0302 , we set faddout : RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u00d7 RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u2192 R, ((h, h\u0302), (h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032)) 7\u2192 fout(h, h\u2032) + f\u0302out(h\u0302, h\u0302\u2032). Then it holds that faddout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,W1  =fout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj + f\u0302out  m\u2211 i=1 h\u0302L,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 h\u0302L,Wj  =F (G,H) + F\u0302 (G,H). To obtain F \u00b7 F\u0302 , we set fmultiplyout : RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u00d7 RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u2192 R, ((h, h\u0302), (h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032)) 7\u2192 fout(h, h\u2032) \u00b7 f\u0302out(h\u0302, h\u0302\u2032). Then it holds that fmultiplyout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,W1  =fout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj  \u00b7 f\u0302out  m\u2211 i=1 h\u0302L,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 h\u0302L,Wj  =F (G,H) \u00b7 F\u0302 (G,H). The constructed GNNs satisfy F (G,H) + F\u0302 (G,H) \u2208 FGNN and F (G,H) \u00b7 F\u0302 (G,H) \u2208 FGNN, which finishes the proof. Lemma D.3. If F \u2208 FGNN has L layers, then there exists F\u0302 \u2208 FGNN with L + 1 layers such that F = F\u0302 . Proof of Lemma D.3. Suppose that F is constructed by fVin , f W in , fout, {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0. We choose fVL+1 \u2261 0, fWL+1 \u2261 0, gVL+1(h, h\u2032) = h, gWL+1(h, h\u2032) = h. Let F\u0302 be constructed by fVin , f W in , fout, {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl } L+1 l=0 . Then F\u0302 has L+ 1 layers with F\u0302 = F . E UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION OF FWGNN This section provides an universal approximation result of FWGNN. Theorem E.1. Let X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn be a compact subset that is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn. Suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 C(X,Rn) satisfies the followings: (i) For any \u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, and (G,H) \u2208 X , it holds that \u03a6 ((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H)) = \u03c3W (\u03a6(G,H)). (E.1) (ii) \u03a6(G,H) = \u03a6(G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for all (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 X with (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). (iii) Given any (G,H) \u2208 X and any j, j\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, if Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 (the vertex colors obtained in the l-th iteration in WL test) holds for any l \u2208 N and any choices of hash functions, then \u03a6(G,H)j = \u03a6(G,H)j\u2032 . Then for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 FWGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208X \u2225\u03a6(G,H)\u2212 F (G,H)\u2225 < \u03f5. Theorem E.1 is a LP-graph version of results on the closure of equivariant GNN class in Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). The main tool in the proof of Theorem E.1 is the following generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem for equivariant functions established in Azizian & Lelarge (2021). Theorem E.2 (Generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem (Azizian & Lelarge, 2021, Theorem 22)). Let X be a compact topology space and let G be a finite group that acts continuously on X and Rn. Define the collection of all equivariant continuous functions from X to Rn as follows: CE(X,Rn) = {F \u2208 C(X,Rn) : F (g \u2217 x) = g \u2217 F (x), \u2200 x \u2208 X, g \u2208 G}. Consider any F \u2282 CE(X,Rn) and any \u03a6 \u2208 CE(X,Rn). Suppose the following conditions hold: (i) F is a subalgebra of C(X,Rn) and 1 \u2208 F . (ii) For any x, x\u2032 \u2208 X , if f(x) = f(x\u2032) holds for any f \u2208 C(X,R) with f1 \u2208 F , then for any F \u2208 F , there exists g \u2208 G such that F (x) = g \u2217 F (x\u2032). (iii) For any x, x\u2032 \u2208 X , if F (x) = F (x\u2032) holds for any F \u2208 F , then \u03a6(x) = \u03a6(x\u2032). (iv) For any x \u2208 X , it holds that \u03a6(x)j = \u03a6(x)j\u2032 , \u2200 (j, j\u2032) \u2208 J(x), where J(x) = {{1, 2, . . . , n}n : F (x)j = F (x)j\u2032 , \u2200 F \u2208 F}. Then for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 F such that sup x\u2208X \u2225\u03a6(x)\u2212 F (x)\u2225 < \u03f5. We refer to Timofte (2005) for different versions of Stone-Weierstrass theorem, that is also used in Azizian & Lelarge (2021). In the proof of Theorem E.1, we also need the following lemma whose proof is almost the same as the proof of Lemma D.2 and is hence omitted. Lemma E.3. FWGNN is a subalgebra of C(Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn ,Rn). Proof of Theorem E.1. Let Sm \u00d7 Sn act on Rn via (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 y = \u03c3W (y), \u2200 \u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, y \u2208 Rn. Then it follows from (E.1) that \u03a6 is equivariant. In addition, the definition of graph neural networks directly guarantees the equivariance of functions in FWGNN. Therefore, one only needs to verify the conditions with F as FWGNN and G as Sn in Theorem E.2: \u2022 Condition (i) in Theorem E.2 follows from Lemma E.3 and the definition of FWGNN. \u2022 Condition (ii) in Theorem E.2 follows from Theorem 4.2 and FGNN1 \u2282 FWGNN. \u2022 Condition (iii) in Theorem E.2 follows from Corollary C.4 and Condition (ii) in Theorem E.1. \u2022 Condition (iv) in Theorem E.2 follows from Corollary C.5 and Condition (iii) in Theorem E.1. It finishes the proof. F PROOF OF MAIN THEOREMS: We collect the proofs of main theorems stated in Section 3 in this section. Proof of Theorem 3.1. If F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for any F \u2208 FGNN, then Theorem 4.2 guarantees that (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Thus, Condition (i), (ii), and (iii) follow directly from Lemmas B.2, B.3, and B.4, respectively. Furthermore, if FW (G,H) = FW (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 FW \u2208 FWGNN, then it follows from Corollary C.4 and Corollary B.7 that the two LP problems associated to (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) share the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Then we head into the proof of three main approximation theorems, say Theorem 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6, that state that GNNs can approximate the feasibility mapping \u03a6feas, the optimal objective value mapping \u03a6obj, and the optimal solution mapping \u03a6solu with arbitrarily small error, respectively. We have established in Sections D and E several theorems for graph neural networks to approximate continuous mappings. Therefore, the proof of Theorem 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6 basically consists of two steps: (i) Show that the mappings \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu are measurable. (ii) Use continuous mappings to approximate the target measurable mappings, and then apply the universal approximation results established in Sections D and E. Let us first prove the feasibility of \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu in the following three lemmas. Lemma F.1. The feasibility mapping \u03a6feas defined in (2.7) is measurable, i.e., the preimages \u03a6\u22121feas(0) and \u03a6\u22121feas(1) are both measurable subsets of Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Proof of Lemma F.1. It suffices to prove that for any \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m and any Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the set Xfeas := {(A, b, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : \u2203 x \u2208 Rn, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu}, is a measurable subset in Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu|. Without loss of generality, we assume that \u25e6 = (\u2264, . . . ,\u2264,=, . . . ,=,\u2265, . . . ,\u2265) where \u201c\u2264\u201d, \u201c=\u201d, and \u201c\u2265\u201d appear for k1, k2 \u2212 k1, and m\u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 times, respectively, 0 \u2264 k1 \u2264 k2 \u2264 m. Let us define a function Vfeas : Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| \u00d7 Rn \u2192 R\u22650 that measures to what extend a point in Rn violates the constraints: Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) = max  max1\u2264i\u2264k1  n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj \u2212 bi  + , max k1<i\u2264k2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj \u2212 bi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , max k2<i\u2264m bi \u2212 n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj  + , max j\u2208Nl (lj \u2212 xj)+, max j\u2208Nu (xj \u2212 uj)+  , where y+ = max{y, 0}. It can be seen that Vfeas is continuous and Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) = 0 if and only if Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, and xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu. Therefore, for any (A, b, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu|, the followings are equivalent: \u2022 (A, b, l, u) \u2208 Xfeas. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 N+ and x \u2208 BR := {x\u2032 \u2208 Rn : \u2225x\u2032\u2225 \u2264 R}, such that Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) = 0. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 N+ such that for any r \u2208 N+, Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) \u2264 1/r holds for some x \u2208 BR \u2229Qn. This implies that Xfeas can be described via\u22c3 R\u2208N+ \u22c2 r\u2208N+ \u22c3 x\u2208BR\u2229Qn { (A, b, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) \u2264 1 r } . Since Qn is countable and V is continuous, we immediately obtain from the above expression that Xfeas is measurable. Lemma F.2. The optimal objective value mapping \u03a6obj defined in (2.8) is measurable. Proof of Lemma F.2. It suffices to prove that for any \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m, any Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}, and any \u03d5 \u2208 R, the set Xobj := {(A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : \u2203 x \u2208 Rn, s.t. c\u22a4x \u2264 \u03d5, Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu}, is a measurable subset in Rm\u00d7n\u00d7Rm\u00d7Rn\u00d7R|Nl|\u00d7R|Nu|. Then the proof follows the same lines as in the proof of Lemma F.1, with a different violation function Vobj(A, b, c, l, u, x) = max { (c\u22a4x\u2212 \u03d5)+, Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) } . Lemma F.3. The optimal solution mapping \u03a6solu defined in (2.9) is measurable. Proof of Lemma F.3. It suffices to show that for every j0 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the mapping \u03c0j0 \u25e6 \u03a6solu : \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2192 R, is measurable, where \u03c0j0 : Rn \u2192 R maps a vector x \u2208 Rn to its j0-th component. Similar as before, one can consider any \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m, any Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}, and any \u03d5 \u2208 R, and prove that the set Xsolu := {(A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : The LP problem, min x\u2208Rd c\u22a4x, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu, has a finite optimal objective value, and its optimal solution with the smallest \u21132 \u2212 norm, xopt, satisfies (xopt)j0 < \u03d5}, is measurable. Note that we have fixed \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m and Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let \u03b9 : Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| \u2192 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , be the embedding map. Define another violation function Vsolu : (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R)\u00d7 Rn \u2192 R, via Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) = max {( c\u22a4x\u2212 \u03a6obj(\u03b9(A, b, c, l, u)) ) + , Vfeas(A, b, c, l, u, x) } , which is measurable due to the measurability of \u03a6obj and the continuity of Vfeas. Moreover, Vsolu is continuous with respect to x. Therefore, the followings are equivalent for (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R): \u2022 (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 Xsolu. \u2022 There exists x \u2208 Rn with xj0 < \u03d5, such that Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) = 0 and Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) > 0, \u2200 x\u2032 \u2208 B\u2225x\u2225, x\u2032j0 \u2265 \u03d5. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 Q+, r \u2208 N+, and x \u2208 BR with xj0 \u2264 \u03d5\u22121/r, such that Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) = 0 and Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) > 0, \u2200 x\u2032 \u2208 BR, x\u2032j0 \u2265 \u03d5. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 Q+ and r \u2208 N+, such that for all r\u2032 \u2208 N+, \u2203 x \u2208 BR \u2229 Qn, xj0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2212 1/r, s.t. Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) < 1/r\u2032 and that \u2203 r\u2032\u2032 \u2208 N+, s.t., Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) \u2265 1/r\u2032\u2032, \u2200 x\u2032 \u2208 BR \u2229Qn, x\u2032j0 \u2265 \u03d5. Therefore, one has that Xsolu = \u22c3 R\u2208Q+ \u22c3 r\u2208N+ \u22c2 r\u2032\u2208N+ \u22c3 x\u2208BR\u2229Qn, xj0\u2264\u03d5\u2212 1 r { (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R) : Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) < 1 r\u2032 } \u2229  \u22c3 r\u2032\u2032\u2208N+ \u22c2 x\u2032\u2208BR\u2229Qn, x\u2032j0\u2265\u03d5 { (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R) : Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) \u2265 1 r\u2032\u2032 } , which is measurable. With the measurability of \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu established, the next step is to approximate \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu using continuous mappings, and hence graph neural networks. Before proceeding, let us mention that Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn is essentially the disjoint union of finitely many product spaces of Euclidean spaces and discrete spaces that have finitely many points and are equipped with discrete measures. More specifically, Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u223c= Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 (R\u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265})m \u00d7 (R\u00d7 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e})\u00d7 (R \u222a {+\u221e}))n \u223c= n\u22c3 k,k\u2032=0 (nk)\u22c3 s=1 (nk\u2032)\u22c3 s\u2032=1 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 Rn\u2212k \u00d7 Rn\u2212k \u2032 \u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265}m \u00d7 {\u2212\u221e}k \u00d7 {+\u221e}k \u2032 . Therefore, many results in real analysis for Euclidean spaces still apply for Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn and Meas(\u00b7), including the following Lusin\u2019s theorem. Theorem F.4 (Lusin\u2019s theorem (Evans & Garzepy, 2018, Theorem 1.14)). Let \u00b5 be a Borel regular measure on Rn and let f : Rn \u2192 Rm be \u00b5-measurable. Then for any \u00b5-measurable X \u2282 Rn with \u00b5(X) < \u221e and any \u03f5 > 0, there exists a compact set E \u2282 X with \u00b5(X\\E) < \u03f5, such that f |E is continuous. Proof of Theorem 3.2. Since X \u2282 Gm,n\u00d7HVm\u00d7HWn is measurable with finite measure, according to Lusin\u2019s theorem, there is a compact set E \u2282 X such that \u03a6feas|E is continuous with Meas(X\\E) < \u03f5. By Lemma B.2 and Theorem 4.3, there exists F \u2208 FGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208E |F (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6feas(G,H)| < 1 2 , which implies that IF (G,H)>1/2 = \u03a6feas(G,H), \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 E. Therefore, one obtains Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X : IF (G,H)>1/2 \u0338= \u03a6feas(G,H) }) \u2264 Meas(X\\E) < \u03f5, and the proof is completed. Proof of Corollary 3.3. As a finite set, D is compact and \u03a6feas|D is continuous. The rest of the proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.2, using Lemma B.2 and Theorem 4.3. Proof of Theorem 3.4. (i) The proof follows the same lines as in the proof of Theorem 3.2, with the difference that we approximate \u03a6(G,H) = { 1, if \u03a6obj(G,H) \u2208 R, 0, otherwise, instead of \u03a6feas and we use Lemma B.3 instead of Lemma B.2. (ii) The proof is still similar to that of Theorem 3.2. By Lusin\u2019s theorem, there is a compact set E \u2282 X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) such that \u03a6obj|E is continuous with Meas ( (X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R))\\E ) < \u03f5. Using Lemma B.3 and Theorem 4.3, there exists F2 \u2208 FGNN with sup (G,H)\u2208E |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| < \u03b4, which implies that Meas ({(G,H) \u2208 X : |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| > \u03b4}) \u2264 Meas ( (X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R))\\E ) < \u03f5. Proof of Corollary 3.5. The results can be proved using similar techniques as in Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.4 by noticing that any finite dataset is compact on which any real-valued function is continuous. Proof of Theorem 3.6. Without loss of generality, we can assume that X \u2282 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn; otherwise, we can replace X by\u22c3 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217X . By Lusin\u2019s theorem, there exists a compact subset E \u2032 \u2282 X such that Meas(A\\X) < \u03f5/|Sm \u00d7 Sn| and that \u03a6solu|E\u2032 is continuous. Define another compact set: E = \u22c2 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 E\u2032 \u2282 X, which is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn and satisfies Meas(X\\E) \u2264 \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn Meas(X\\(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 E\u2032) = \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn Meas((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217X\\(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 E\u2032) = \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn \u00b5((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (X\\E\u2032)) = \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn \u00b5(X\\E\u2032) < \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn \u03f5 |Sm \u00d7 Sn| = \u03f5. Note that the three conditions in Theorem E.1 are satisfied by the definition of \u03a6solu, Corollary B.7, and Corollary B.6, respectively. Using Theorem E.1, there exists FW \u2208 FWGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208E \u2225FW (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 < \u03b4. Therefore, it holds that Meas ({(G,H) \u2208 X : \u2225FW (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 > \u03b4}) \u2264 Meas(X\\E) < \u03f5, which completes the proof. Proof of Corollary 3.7. One can assume that D is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn; otherwise, a larger but still finite dataset, \u22c3 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 D, can be considered instead of D. The rest of the proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.6 since D is compact and \u03a6solu|D is continuous. G DETAILS OF THE NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS: LP instance generation We generate each LP with the following way. We set m = 10 and n = 50. Each matrix A is sparse with 100 nonzero elements whose positions are sampled uniformly and values are sampled normally. Each element in b, c are sampled i.i.d and uniformly from [\u22121, 1]. The variable bounds l, u are sampled with N (0, 10). If lj > uj , then we swap lj and uj for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Furthermore, we sample \u25e6i i.i.d with P(\u25e6i = \u201c \u2264 \u201d) = 0.7 and P(\u25e6i = \u201c = \u201d) = 0.3. With the generation approach above, the probability that each LP to be feasible is around 0.53. MLP architectures As we mentions in the main text, all the learnable functions in GNN are taken as MLPs. The input functions fVin , f W in have one hidden layer and other functions fout, f W out , {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0 have two hidden layers. The embedding size d0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dL are uniformly taken as d that is chosen from {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512}. All the activation functions are ReLU. Training settings We use Adam Kingma & Ba (2014) as our training optimizer with learning rate of 0.0003. The loss function is taken as mean squared error. All the experiments are conducted on a Linux server with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8163 GPU and eight NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Applying machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate optimization, also known as Learning to Optimize (L2O), is attracting increasing attention recently. It has been reported in the literature that L2O shows great potentials on both continuous optimization Monga et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2021); Amos (2022) and combinatorial optimization Bengio et al. (2021); Mazyavkina et al. (2021). Many of the L2O works train a parameterized model that takes the optimization problem as input and outputs information useful to the classic algorithms, such as a good initial solution and branching decisions Nair et al. (2020), and some even directly generate an approximate optimal solution Gregor & LeCun (2010). In these works, one is building an ML model to approximate the mapping from an explicit optimization instance either to its key properties or directly to its solution. The ability to achieve accurate approximation is called the representation power or expressive power of the model. When the approximation is accurate, the model can solve the problem or provide useful information to guide an optimization algorithm. This paper tries to address a fundamental but open theoretical problem for linear programming (LP): Which neural network can represent LP and predict its key properties and solution? (P0) To clarify, by solution we mean the optimal solution. We hope the answer to this question paves the way toward answering this question for other optimization types. Linear Programming (LP). LP is an important type of optimization problem with a wide range of applications, such as scheduling Hanssmann & Hess (1960), signal processing Candes & Tao (2005), machine learning Dedieu et al. (2022), etc. A general LP problem is defined as: min x\u2208Rn c\u22a4x, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u, (1.1) where A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, c \u2208 Rn, b \u2208 Rm, l \u2208 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e})n, u \u2208 (R \u222a {+\u221e})n, and \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=,\u2265}m. Any LP problems must follow one of the following three cases Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis: \u2022 Infeasible. The feasible set XF := {x \u2208 Rn : Ax \u25e6 b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u} is empty. In another word, there is no point in Rn that satisfies the constraints in LP (1.1). \u2022 Unbounded. The feasible set is non-empty, but the objective value can be arbitrarily good, i.e., unbounded from below. For any R > 0, there exists an x \u2208 XF such that c\u22a4x < \u2212R. \u2022 Feasible and bounded. There exists x\u2217 \u2208 XF such that c\u22a4x\u2217 \u2264 c\u22a4x for all x \u2208 XF . Such x\u2217 is named as an optimal solution, and c\u22a4x\u2217 is the optimal objective value. Thus, considering (P0), an ideal ML model is expected to be able to predict the three key characteristics of LP: feasibility, boundedness, and one of its optimal solutions (if exists), by taking the LP features (A, b, c, l, u, \u25e6) as input. Actually, such input has a strong mathematical structure. If we swap the positions of the i, j-th variable in (1.1), elements in vectors b, c, l, u, \u25e6 and columns of matrix A will be reordered. The reordered features (A\u0302, b, c\u0302, l\u0302, u\u0302, \u25e6\u0302) actually represent an exactly equivalent LP problem with the original one (A, b, c, l, u, \u25e6). Such property is named as permutation invariance. If we do not explicitly restrict ML models with a permutation invariant structure, the models may overfit to the variable/constraint orders of instances in the training set. Motivated by this point, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that are permutation invariant naturally. GNN in L2O. GNN is a type of neural networks defined on graphs and widely applied in many areas, for example, recommender systems, traffic, chemistry, etc Wu et al. (2020); Zhou et al. (2020). Solving optimization problems with GNN is a recent arising topic in the literature Peng et al. (2021); Cappart et al. (2021). Many graph-related optimization problems, like minimum vertex cover, traveling salesman, vehicle routing, can be represented and solved approximately with GNNs due to their problem structures Khalil et al. (2017); Kool et al. (2019); Joshi et al. (2019); Drori et al. (2020). Besides that, one may solve a general LP or mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with the help of GNNs. Gasse et al. (2019) proposed to represent an MILP with a bipartite graph and apply a GNN on this graph to guide an MILP solver. Ding et al. (2020) proposed a tripartite graph to represent MILP. Since that, many approaches have been proposed to guide MILP or LP solvers with GNNs Nair et al. (2020); Gupta et al. (2020); Shen et al. (2021); Gupta et al. (2022); Khalil et al. (2022); Liu et al. (2022); Paulus et al. (2022); Qu et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022). Although encouraging empirical results have been observed, theoretical foundations are still lack for this approach. Specifying (P0), we ask: Are there GNNs that can predict the feasibility, boundedness and an optimal solution of LP? (P1) Related works and contributions. To answer (P1), one needs the theory of separation power and representation power. Separation power of a neural network (NN) means its ability to distinguish two different inputs. In our settings, a NN with strong separation power means that it can outputs different results when it is applied on any two different LPs. Representation power of NN means its ability to approximate functions of interest. The theory of representation power is established upon the separation power. Only functions with strong enough separation power may possess strong representation power. The power of GNN has been studied in the literature (see Sato (2020); Jegelka (2022); Li & Leskovec (2022) for comprehensive surveys), and some theoretical efforts have been made to represent some graph-related optimization problems with GNN Sato et al. (2019); Loukas (2020). However, there are still gaps to answer question (P1) since the relationships between characteristics of LP and properties of graphs are not well established. Our contributions are listed below: \u2022 (Separation Power). In the literature, it has been shown that the separation power of GNN is equal to the WL testXu et al. (2019); Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). However, there exist many pairs of LPs that cannot be distinguished by the WL test. We show that those puzzling LP pairs share the same feasibility, boundedness, and even an optimal solution if exists. Thus, GNN has strong enough separation power. \u2022 (Representation Power). To the best of our knowledge, we established the first complete proof that GNN can universally represent a broad class of LPs. More precisely, we prove that, there exist GNNs that can be arbitrarily close to the following three mappings: \u2013 LP \u2192 feasibility, \u2013 LP \u2192 optimal objective value (\u2212\u221e if unbounded and \u221e if infeasible), \u2013 LP \u2192 an optimal solution (if exists), although they are not continuous functions and cannot be covered by the literatureKeriven & Peyre\u0301 (2019); Chen et al. (2019); Maron et al. (2019a;b); Keriven et al. (2021). \u2022 (Experimental Validation). We design and conduct experiments that demonstrate the power of GNN on representing LP. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide preliminaries, including related notions, definitions and concepts. In Section 3, we present our main theoretical results. The sketches of proofs are provided in Section4. We validate our results with numerical experiments in Section 5 and we conclude this paper with Section 6. 2 PRELIMINARIES: In this section, we present concepts and definitions that will be used throughout this paper. We first describe how to represent an LP with a weighted bipartite graph, then we define GNN on those LP-induced graphs, and finally we further clarify question (P1) with strict mathematical definitions. 2.1 LP REPRESENTED AS WEIGHTED BIPARTITE GRAPH: Before representing LPs with graphs, we first define the graph that we will adopt in this paper: weighted bipartite graph. A weighted bipartite graph G = (V \u222a W,E) consists of a vertex set V \u222aW that are divided into two groups V and W with V \u2229W = \u2205, and a collection E of weighted edges, where each edge connects exactly one vertex in V and one vertex in W . Note that there is no edge connecting vertices in the same vertex group. E can also be viewed as a function E : V \u00d7W \u2192 R. We use Gm,n to denote the collection of all weighted bipartite graphs G = (V \u222aW,E) with |V | = m and |W | = n. We always write V = {v1, v2, . . . , vm}, W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}, and Ei,j = E(vi, wj), for i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . ,m}, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. One can equip each vertex with a feature vector. Throughout this paper, we denote hVi \u2208 HV as the feature vector of vertex vi \u2208 V and denote hWj \u2208 HW as the feature vector of vertex wj \u2208 W , where HV ,HW are feature spaces. Then we define HVm := (HV )m,HWn := (HW )n and concatenate all the vertex features together as H = (hV1 , h V 2 , . . . , h V m, h W 1 , h W 2 , . . . , h W n ) \u2208 HVm \u00d7HWn . Finally, a weighted bipartite graph with vertex features is defined as a tuple (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . With the concepts described above, one can represent an LP (1.1) as a bipartite graph Gasse et al. (2019). Each vertex in W represents a variable in LP and each vertex in V represents a constraint. The graph topology is defined with the matrix A in the linear constraint. More specifically, let us set \u2022 Vertex vi represents the i-th constraint in Ax \u25e6 b, and vertex wj represents the j-th variable xj . \u2022 Information of constraints is involved in the feature of vi: hVi = (bi, \u25e6i). \u2022 The space of constraint features is defined as HV := R\u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265}. \u2022 Information of variables is involved in the feature of wi: hWj = (cj , lj , uj). \u2022 The space of variable features is defined as HW := R\u00d7 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e})\u00d7 (R \u222a {+\u221e}). \u2022 The edge connecting vi and wj has weight Ei,j = Ai,j . Then an LP is represented as a graph (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n\u00d7HVm\u00d7HWn . In the rest of this paper, we coin such graphs as LP-induced Graphs or LP-Graphs for simplicity. We present an LP instance and its corresponding LP-graph in Figure 1. 2.2 GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS FOR LP: The GNNs in this paper always take an LP-Graph as input and the output has two cases: \u2022 The output is a single real number. In this case, GNN is a function Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R and usually used to predict the properties of the whole graph. \u2022 Each vertex in W has an output. Consequently, GNN is a function Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn \u2192 Rn. Since W represents variables in LP, GNN is used to predict properties of each variable in this case. Now we define the GNN structure precisely. First we encode the input features into the embedding space with learnable functions fVin : HV \u2192 Rd0 and fWin : HW \u2192 Rd0 : h0,Vi = f V in (h V i ), h 0,W j = f W in (h W j ), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (2.1) where h0,Vi , h 0,W j \u2208 Rd0 are initial embedded vertex features and d0 is their dimension. Then we choose learnable functions fVl , f W l : Rdl\u22121 \u2192 Rdl and gVl , gWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u2192 Rdl and update the hidden states with1: hl,Vi = g V l ( hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) ) , i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, (2.2) hl,Wj = g W l ( hl\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,jf V l (h l\u22121,V i ) ) , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (2.3) where hl,Vi , h l,W j \u2208 Rdl are vertex features at layer l (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) and their dimensions are d1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dL respectively. The output layer of the single-output GNN is defined with a learnable function fout : RdL \u00d7 RdL \u2192 R: yout = fout ( m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj ) . (2.4) The output of the vertex-output GNN is defined with fWout : RdL \u00d7 RdL \u00d7 RdL \u2192 R: yout(wj) = f W out ( m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj , h L,W j ) , j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. (2.5) We denote collections of single-output GNNs and vertex-output GNNs with FGNN and FWGNN, respectively: FGNN ={F : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R | F yields (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.4)}, FWGNN ={F : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 Rn | F yields (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.5)}. (2.6) In practice, all the learnable functions in GNN fVin , f W in , fout, f W out , {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0 are usually parameterized with multi-linear perceptrons (MLPs). In our theoretical analysis, we assume for simplicity that those functions may take all continuous functions on given domains, following the settings in (Azizian & Lelarge, 2021, Section C.1). Thanks to the universal approximation properties of MLP Hornik et al. (1989); Cybenko (1989), one can extend our theoretical results by taking those learnable functions as large enough MLPs. 2.3 REVISITING QUESTION (P1): With the definitions of LP-Graph and GNN above, we revisit the question (P1) and provide its precise mathematical description here. First we define three mappings that respectively describe the feasibility, optimal objective value and an optimal solution of an LP (if exists). Feasibility mapping The feasibility mapping is a classification function \u03a6feas : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 {0, 1}, (2.7) where \u03a6feas(G,H) = 1 if the LP associated with (G,H) is feasible and \u03a6feas(G,H) = 0 otherwise. 1Note that the update rules in (2.2) and (2.3) follow a message-passing way, where each vertex only collects information from its neighbors. Since Ei,j = 0 if there is no connection between vertices vi and wj , the sum operator in (2.2) can be rewritten as \u2211 j\u2208N (vi), where N (vi) denotes the set of neighbors of vertex vi. Optimal objective value mapping Denote \u03a6obj : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e,\u2212\u221e}, (2.8) as the optimal objective value mapping, i.e., for any (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , \u03a6obj(G,H) is the optimal objective value of the LP problem associated with (G,H). Remark 2.1. The optimal objective value of a LP problem can be a real number or \u221e/\u2212\u221e. The \u201c\u221e\u201d case corresponds to infeasible problems, while the \u201c\u2212\u221e\u201d case consists of LP problems whose objective function is unbounded from below in the feasible region. The preimage of all finite real numbers under \u03a6obj, \u03a6\u22121obj (R), actually describes all LPs with finite optimal objective value. Remark 2.2. In the case that a LP problem has finite optimal objective value, it is possible that the problem admits multiple optimal solutions. However, the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm must be unique. In fact, if x \u0338= x\u2032 are two different solutions with \u2225x\u2225 = \u2225x\u2032\u2225, where \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 denotes the \u21132-norm throughout this paper. Then 12 (x + x \u2032) is also an optimal solution due to the convexity of LPs, and it holds that \u2225 12 (x + x \u2032)\u22252 < 12\u2225x\u2225 2 + 12\u2225x \u2032\u22252 = \u2225x\u22252 = \u2225x\u2032\u22252, i.e., \u2225 12 (x+ x \u2032)\u2225 < \u2225x\u2225 = \u2225x\u2032\u2225, where the inequality is strict since x \u0338= x\u2032. Therefore, x and x\u2032 cannot be optimal solutions with the smallest \u21132-norm. Optimal solution mapping For any (G,H) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121obj (R), we have remarked before that the LP problem associated with (G,H) has a unique optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Let \u03a6solu : \u03a6 \u22121 obj (R) \u2192 R n, (2.9) be the mapping that maps (G,H) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) to the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Invariance and Equivariance We denote Sm, Sn as the group consisting of all permutations on vertex groups V,W respectively. In another word, Sm involves all permutations on the constraints of LP and Sn involves all permutations on the variables. In this paper, we say a function F : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 R is invariant if it satisfies F (G,H) = F ((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H)) , \u2200\u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, and a function FW : Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u2192 Rn is equivariant if it satisfies \u03c3W (FW (G,H)) = FW ((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H))) , \u2200\u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, where (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H) is the permuted graph obtained from reordering indices in (G,H) using (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ), which is the group action of Sm \u00d7 Sn on Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . One can check that \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and any F \u2208 FGNN are invariant, and that \u03a6solu and any FW \u2208 FWGNN are equivariant. Question (P1) actually asks: Does there exist F \u2208 FGNN that well approximates \u03a6feas or \u03a6obj? And does there exist FW \u2208 FWGNN that well approximates \u03a6solu? 3 MAIN RESULTS: This section presents our main theorems that answer question (P1). As we state in the introduction, representation power is built upon separation power in our paper. We first present with the following theorem that GNN has strong enough separation power to represent LP. Theorem 3.1. Given any two LP instances (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , if F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) for all F \u2208 FGNN, then they share some common characteristics: (i) Both LP problems are feasible or both are infeasible, i.e., \u03a6feas(G,H) = \u03a6feas(G\u0302, H\u0302). (ii) The two LP problems have the same optimal objective value, i.e., \u03a6obj(G,H) = \u03a6obj(G\u0302, H\u0302). (iii) If both problems are feasible and bounded, then they have the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm, up to a permutation, i.e., \u03a6solu(G,H) = \u03c3W (\u03a6solu(G\u0302, H\u0302)) for some \u03c3W \u2208 Sn. Furthermore, if FW (G,H) = FW (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 FW \u2208 FWGNN, then (iii) holds without taking permutations, i.e., \u03a6solu(G,H) = \u03a6solu(G\u0302, H\u0302). This theorem demonstrates that the function spaces FGNN and FWGNN are rich enough to distinguish the characteristics of LP. Given two LP instances (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302), as long as their feasibility or boundedness are different, there must exist F \u2208 FGNN that can distinguish them: F (G,H) \u0338= F (G\u0302, H\u0302). Moreover, as long as their optimal solutions with the smallest \u21132-norm are different, there must exist FW \u2208 FWGNN that can distinguish them: FW (G,H) \u0338= FW (G\u0302, H\u0302). With Theorem 3.1 served as a foundation, we can prove that GNN can approximate the three mappings \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj and \u03a6solu to arbitrary precision. Before presenting those results, we first define some concepts of the space Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Topology and measure Throughout this paper, we consider Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , where HV = R \u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265} and HW = R \u00d7 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e}) \u00d7 (R \u222a {+\u221e}), as a topology space with product topology and a measurable space with product measure. It\u2019s enough to define the topology and measure of each part separately. Since each graph in this paper (without vertex features) can be represented with matrix A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, the graph space Gm,n is isomorphic to the Euclidean space Rm\u00d7n: Gm,n \u223c= Rm\u00d7n and we equip Gm,n with the standard Euclidean topology and the standard Lebesgue measure. The real spaces R in HW and HV are also equipped with the standard Euclidean topology and Lebesgue measure. All the discrete spaces {\u2264,=,\u2265}, {\u2212\u221e}, and {+\u221e} have the discrete topology, and all unions are disjoint unions. We equip those spaces with a discrete measure \u00b5(S) = |S|, where |S| is the number of elements in a finite set S. This finishes the whole definition and we denote Meas(\u00b7) as the measure on Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Theorem 3.2. Given any measurable X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite measure, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists some F \u2208 FGNN, such that Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X : IF (G,H)>1/2 \u0338= \u03a6feas(G,H) }) < \u03f5, where I\u00b7 is the indicator function, i.e., IF (G,H)>1/2 = 1 if F (G,H) > 1/2 and IF (G,H)>1/2 = 0 otherwise. This theorem shows that GNN is a good classifier for LP instances in X as long as X has finite measure. If we use F (G,H) > 1/2 as the criteria to predict the feasibility, the classification error rate is controlled by \u03f5/Meas(X), where \u03f5 can be arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we show that GNN can perfectly fit any dataset with finite samples, which is presented in the following corollary. Corollary 3.3. For any D \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite instances, there exists F \u2208 FGNN that IF (G,H)>1/2 = \u03a6feas(G,H), \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D. Besides the feasibility, GNN can also approximate \u03d5obj and \u03d5solu. Theorem 3.4. Given any measurable X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite measure, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F1 \u2208 FGNN such that Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X : IF1(G,H)>1/2 \u0338= I\u03a6obj(G,H)\u2208R }) < \u03f5, (3.1) and for any \u03f5, \u03b4 > 0, there exists F2 \u2208 FGNN such that Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) : |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| > \u03b4 }) < \u03f5. (3.2) Recall the definition of \u03a6obj in (2.8) that it can take {\u00b1\u221e} as its value. Thus, \u03a6obj(G,H) \u2208 R means the LP corresponding to (G,H) is feasible and bounded with a finite optimal objective value, and inequality (3.1) illustrates that GNN can identify those feasible and bounded LPs among the whole set X , up to a given precision \u03f5. Inequality (3.2) shows that GNN can also approximate the optimal value. The measure of the set of LP instances of which the optimal value cannot be approximated with \u03b4-precision is controlled by \u03f5. The following corollary gives the results on dataset with finite instances. Corollary 3.5. For any D \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite instances, there exists F1 \u2208 FGNN such that IF1(G,H)>1/2 = I\u03a6obj(G,H)\u2208R, \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D, and for any \u03b4 > 0, there exists F2 \u2208 FGNN, such that |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| < \u03b4, \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R). Finally, we show that GNN is able to represent the optimal solution mapping \u03a6solu. Theorem 3.6. Given any measurable X \u2282 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite measure, for any \u03f5, \u03b4 > 0, there exists some FW \u2208 FWGNN, such that Meas ({(G,H) \u2208 X : \u2225F (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 > \u03b4}) < \u03f5. Corollary 3.7. Given any D \u2282 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn with finite instances, for any \u03b4 > 0, there exists FW \u2208 FWGNN, such that \u2225F (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 < \u03b4, \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 D. 4 SKETCH OF PROOF: In this section, we will present a sketch of our proof lines and provide examples to show the intuitions. The full proof lines are presented in the appendix. Separation power Separation power of GNN is closely related to the graph isomorphism problem. To identify whether two given graphs are isomorphic, one may apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test Weisfeiler & Leman (1968), a widely studied method that can distinguish a broad class of graphs. It has been shown in the literature that the separation power of GNN is actually equal to the standard WL test (see e.g. Xu et al. (2019)). To apply the WL test on LP-graphs, we describe a modified WL test in Algorithm 1, that is slightly different from the standard WL test. Algorithm 1 The WL test for LP-Graphs2(denoted by WLLP) Require: A graph instance (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn and iteration limit L > 0. 1: Initialize with C0,Vi = HASH0,V (h V i ), C 0,W j = HASH0,W (h W j ). 2: for l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L do 3: Cl,Vi = HASHl,V ( Cl\u22121,Vi , \u2211n j=1 Ei,jHASH \u2032 l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj )) . 4: Cl,Wj = HASHl,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj , \u2211n i=1 Ei,jHASH \u2032 l,V ( Cl\u22121,Vi )) . 5: end for 6: return The multisets containing all colors {{CL,Vi }}mi=0, {{C L,W j }}nj=0. We denote Algorithm 1 by WLLP(\u00b7), and we say that two LP-graphs (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) can be distinguished by Algorithm 1 if and only if there exist a positive integer L and injective hash functions {HASHl,V ,HASHl,W }Ll=0 \u222a {HASH \u2032 l,V ,HASH \u2032 l,W }Ll=1 such that WLLP ( (G,H), L ) \u0338= WLLP ( (G\u0302, H\u0302), L ) . Unfortunately, there exist infinitely many pairs of non-isomorphic LP-graphs that cannot be distinguished by Algorithm 1. Figure 2 provide such an example. However, any two LP-graphs that cannot be distinguished by Algorithm 1 must share some common characteristics even if they are not isomorphic. For example, let us consider the six LP instances in Figure 2. In each of the three columns, the two non-isomorphic LP instances cannot be distinguished by the WL test. It can be checked that the two instances in the same column share some common characteristics. More specifically, both instances in the first column are infeasible; both instances in the second column are feasible but unbounded; both instances in the third column are feasible and bounded with (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2) being the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Actually, this phenomenon does not only happen on the instances in Figure 2, but also serves as an universal principle for all LP instances. We summarize the results in the following theorem: Theorem 4.1. If (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n\u00d7HVm\u00d7HWn are not distinguishable by Algorithm 1, then \u03a6feas(G,H) = \u03a6feas(G\u0302, H\u0302) and \u03a6obj(G,H) = \u03a6obj(G\u0302, H\u0302). Furthermore, if (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 \u03a6\u22121obj (R), then it holds that \u03a6solu(G,H) = \u03c3W (\u03a6solu(G\u0302, H\u0302)) for some \u03c3W \u2208 Sn. 2In Algorithm 1, multisets, denoted by {{}}, are collections of elements that allow multiple appearance of the same element. Hash functions {HASHl,V ,HASHl,W }Ll=0 injectively map vertex information to vertex colors, while the others {HASH\u2032l,V ,HASH\u2032l,W }Ll=1 injectively map vertex colors to a linear space so that one can define sum and scalar multiplications on their outputs. 1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C l,W 4 for all l \u2265 0, whatever the hash functions are chosen. Based on this graph pair, we construct three pairs of LPs that are both infeasible, both unbounded, both feasible bounded with the same optimal solution, respectively. In other words, the above theorem guarantees the sufficient power of the WL test for separating LP problems with different characteristics, including feasibility, optimal objective value, and optimal solution with smallest \u21132-norm (up to permutation). This combined with the following theorem, which states the equivalence of the separation powers of the WL test and GNNs, yields that GNNs also have sufficient separation power for LP-graphs in the above sense. Theorem 4.2. For any (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , the followings are equivalent: (i) (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) are not distinguishable by Algorithm 1. (ii) F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 F \u2208 FGNN. (iii) For any FW \u2208 FWGNN, there exists \u03c3W \u2208 Sn such that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)). Theorem 4.2 extends the results in Xu et al. (2019); Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022) to the case with the modified WL test (Algorithm 1) and LP-graphs. Representation power Based on the separation power of GNNs, one is able to investigate the representation/approximation power of GNNs. To prove Theorems 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6, we first determine the closure of FGNN or FWGNN in the space of invariant/equivariant continuous functions with respect to the sup-norm, which is also named as the universal approximation. The result of FGNN is stated as follows, where C(X,R) is the collection/algebra of all real-valued continuous function on X . The result of FWGNN can be found in the appendix. Theorem 4.3. Let X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn be a compact set. For any \u03a6 \u2208 C(X,R) that satisfies \u03a6(G,H) = \u03a6(G\u0302, H\u0302) for all (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 X that are not distinguishable by Algorithm 1, and any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 FGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208X |\u03a6(G,H)\u2212 F (G,H)| < \u03f5. Theorem 4.3 can be viewed as an LP-graph version of results in Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). Roughly speaking, graph neural networks can approximate any invariant continuous function whose separation power is upper bounded by that of WL test on compact domain with arbitrarily small error. Although our target mappings \u03a6feas,\u03a6obj,\u03a6solu are not continuous, we prove (in appendix) that they are measurable. Applying Lusin\u2019s theorem (Evans & Garzepy, 2018, Theorem 1.14), we show that GNN can be arbitrarily close to the target mappings except for a small domain. 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS: We present the numerical results that validate our theoretical results in this section. We generate LP instances with m = 10 and n = 50 that are possibly infeasible or feasible and bounded. To check whether GNN can predict feasibility, we generate three data sets with 100, 500, 2500 independent LP instances respectively, and call the solver wrapped in scipy.optimize.linprog to get the feasibility, optimal objective value and an optimal solution for each generated LP. To generate enough feasible and bounded LPs to check whether GNN can approximate the optimal objective value and optimal solution, we follow the same approach as before to generate LP randomly and discard those infeasible LPs until the number of LPs reach our requirement. We train GNNs to fit the three LP characteristics by minimizing the distance between GNN-output and those solvergenerated labels. The building and the training of the GNNs are implemented using TensorFlow and the codes are modified from3 Gasse et al. (2019). We set L = 2 for all GNNs and those learnable functions fVin , f W in , fout, f W out , {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0 are all parameterized with MLPs. Details can be found in the appendix. Our results are reported in Figure 3. All the errors reported in Figure 3 are training errors since generalization is out of the scope of this paper. In Figure 3a, the \u201crate of errors\u201d means the proportion of instances with IF (G,H)>1/2 \u0338= \u03a6feas(G,H). This metric exactly equals to zeros as long as the number of parameters in GNN is large enough, which directly validates Corollary 3.3: the existence of GNNs that can accruately predict the feasibility of LP instances. With the three curves in Figure 3a combined together, we conclude that such principle does not violate as the number of samples increases. This consists with Theorem 3.2. Mean squared errors in Figures 3b and 3c are respectively defined as E(G,H)|F (G,H) \u2212 \u03a6feas(G,H)|2 and E(G,H)\u2225F (G,H) \u2212 \u03a6feas(G,H)\u22252. Therefore, Figures 3b and 3c validates Theorems 3.4 and 3.6 respectively. Note that all the instances used in Figure 3b are feasible and bounded. Thus, Figure 3b actually only validates (3.2) in Theorem 3.4. However, due to the fact that feasibility of an LP is equal to the boundedness of its dual problem, one may dualize each LP and use the conclusion of Figure 3a to validate (3.1) in Theorem 3.4. 6 CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we show that graph neural networks, as well as the WL test, have sufficient separation power to distinguish linear programming problems with different characteristics. In addition, GNNs can approximate LP feasibility, optimal objective value, and optimal solution with arbitrarily small errors on compact domains or finite datasets. These results guarantee that GNN is a proper class of machine learning models to represent linear programs, and hence contribute to the theoretical foundation in the learning-to-optimize community. Future directions include investing the representation power of graph neural networks for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which has been observed with promising experimental results in the literature. 3The codes are modified from https://github.com/ds4dm/learn2branch and we will release codes. A WEISFEILER-LEHMAN (WL) TEST AND COLOR REFINEMENT: The WL test can be viewed as a coloring refinement procedure if there are no collisions of hash functions and their weighted averages. More specifically, each vertex is colored initially according to the group it belongs to and its feature \u2013 two vertices have the same color if and only if they are in the same vertex group and have the same feature. The initial colors are denoted as C0,V1 , C 0,V 2 , . . . , C 0,V m , C 0,W 1 , C 0,W 2 , . . . , C 0,W n . Then at iteration l, the set of vertices with the same color at iteration l \u2212 1 are further partitioned into several subsets according to the colors of their neighbours \u2013 two vertices vi and vi\u2032 are in the same subset if and only if C l\u22121,V i = C l\u22121,V i\u2032 and for any C \u2208 {Cl\u22121,Wj : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n},\u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei,j = \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei\u2032,j , and it is similar for vertices wj and wj\u2032 . After such partition/refinement, vertices are associated with the same color if and only if they are in the same subset, which is the coloring at iteration l. This procedure is terminated if the refinement is trivial, meaning that no sets with the same color are partitioned into at least two subsets, i.e., the coloring is stable. For more information about color refinement, we refer to Berkholz et al. (2017); Arvind et al. (2015; 2017). We then discuss the stable coloring that Algorithm 1 will converge to, for which we made the following definition, where S = {S1, S2, . . . , Ss} is called a partition of a set S if S1\u222aS2\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aSs = S and Si \u2229 Si\u2032 = \u2205, \u2200 1 \u2264 i < i\u2032 \u2264 s. Definition A.1 (Stable Partition Pair of Vertices). Let G = (V \u222a W,E) be a weighted bipartite graph with V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}, and vertex features H = (hV1 , h V 2 , . . . , h V m, h W 1 , h W 2 , . . . , h W n ), and let I = {I1, I2, . . . , Is} and J = {J1, J2, . . . , Jt} be partitions of {1, 2, . . . ,m} and {1, 2, . . . , n}, respectively. We say that (I,J ) is a stable partition pair of vertices for the graph G if the followings are satisfied: (i) hVi = h V i\u2032 holds if i, i \u2032 \u2208 Ip for some p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}. (ii) hWj = h W j\u2032 holds if j, j \u2032 \u2208 Jq for some q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. (iii) For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}, q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, and i, i\u2032 \u2208 Ip, \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ei,j = \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ei\u2032,j . (iv) For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}, q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, and j, j\u2032 \u2208 Jq , \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ei,j = \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ei,j\u2032 . We denote (Il,J l) as the partition pair corresponding the coloring at iteration l of Algorithm 1. Suppose that there are no collisions. Then it is clear that (Il+1,J l+1) is finer than (Il,J l), denoted as (Il+1,J l+1) \u2aaf (Il,J l), which means that for any I \u2208 Il+1 and any J \u2208 J l+1, there exist I \u2032 \u2208 Il and J \u2032 \u2208 J l such that I \u2282 I \u2032 and J \u2282 J \u2032. In addition, (Il+1,J l+1) = (Il,J l) if and only if (Il,J l) is a stable partition pair of vertices. Note that there is at most O(|V | + |W |) iterations leading to strictly finer partition pair, i.e, (Il+1,J l+1) \u2aaf (Il,J l) but (Il+1,J l+1) \u0338= (Il,J l). We can immediately obtain the following result: Theorem A.2. If there are no collision of hash functions and their weighted averages, then Algorithm 1 terminates at a stable partition pair of vertices in O(|V |+ |W |) iterations. Furthermore, for every (G,H) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , the coarsest stable partition pair of vertices exists and is unique, which can be proved using techniques similar to the proof of (Berkholz et al., 2017, Proposition 3). Algorithm 1 terminates at the unique coarsest stable partition pair. This is because that the coloring gin each iteration of Algorithm 1 is always coarser than the unique coarsest stable partition pair (see (Berkholz et al., 2017, Proposition 2)). B SEPARATION POWER OF THE WL TEST: This section gives the proof and some corollaries of Theorem 4.1. First we present some definitions and lemmas, from which the proof of Theorem 4.1 can be immediately derived. Definition B.1. Given (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , we say that (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) can be distinguished by the WL test if there exists some L \u2208 N and some choices of hash functions, HASH0,V , HASH0,W , HASHl,V , HASHl,W , HASH\u2032l,V , and HASH \u2032 l,W , for l = 1, 2, . . . , L, such that the multisets of colors at the L-th iteration of the WL test are different for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302). Let \u223c be an equivalence relationship on Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn defined via: (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) if and only if they can not be distinguished by the WL test. It is clear that (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) if they are isometric, i.e., there exist two permutations, \u03c3V : {1, 2, . . . ,m} \u2192 {1, 2, . . . ,m} and \u03c3W : {1, 2, . . . , n} \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , n}, such that E\u03c3V (i),\u03c3W (j) = E\u0302i,j , hV\u03c3V (i) = h\u0302 V i , and h W \u03c3W (j) = h\u0302Wj , for any i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . ,m} and j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. However, not every pair of WL-indistinguishable graphs consists of isometric ones; see Figure 2 for an example. However, for LP problems that cannot be distinguished by the WL test will share some common properties, even if their associated graphs are not isomorphic. Lemma B.2. If two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems are indistinguishable by the WL test, then either both problems are feasible or both are infeasible. In other words, the WL test can distinguish two LP problems if one of them is feasible while the other one is infeasible. Proof of Lemma B.2. Let us consider two LP problems: min x\u2208Rn c\u22a4x, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u, (B.1) and min x\u2208Rn c\u0302\u22a4x, s.t. A\u0302x \u25e6\u0302 b\u0302, l\u0302 \u2264 x \u2264 u\u0302. (B.2) Let (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), where G = (V \u222a W,E) and G\u0302 = (V \u222a W, E\u0302), be the weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to (B.1) and (B.2), respectively. Since (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), for some choice of hash functions with no collision during Algorithm 1 for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), Theorem A.2 guarantees that Algorithm 1 outputs the same stable coloring for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) up to permutation. More specifically, after doing some permutation, there exist I = {I1, I2, . . . , Is} and J = {J1, J2, . . . , Jt} that are partitions of {1, 2, . . . ,m} and {1, 2, . . . , n}, respectively, such that the followings hold: \u2022 (bi, \u25e6i) = (b\u0302i, \u25e6\u0302i) and is independent of i \u2208 Ip, for any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}. \u2022 (lj , uj) = (l\u0302j , u\u0302j) and is independent of j \u2208 Jq for any q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. \u2022 For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s} and q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ai,j = \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j and is independent of i \u2208 Ip. \u2022 For any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s} and q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}, \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j = \u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j and is independent of j \u2208 Jq . Suppose that the problem (B.1) is feasible with x \u2208 Rn be some point in the feasible region. Define y \u2208 Rt via yq = 1|Jq| \u2211 j\u2208Jq xj and x\u0302 \u2208 R n via x\u0302j = yq , j \u2208 Jq . Fix any p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s} and some i0 \u2208 Ip. It holds for any i \u2208 Ip that n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj \u25e6i bi, i.e., t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ai,jxj \u25e6i0 bi0 , which implies that 1 |Ip| \u2211 i\u2208Ip t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq Ai,jxj = 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j xj \u25e6i0 bi0 . Notice that \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j is constant for j \u2208 Jq , \u2200 q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. Let us denote \u03b1q = \u2211 i\u2208Ip Ai,j =\u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j for any j \u2208 Jq . Then it holds that 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u03b1qxj = 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u03b1qyq = 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j  yq \u25e6i0 bi0 . Note that 1 |Ip| t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq \u2211 i\u2208Ip A\u0302i,j  yq = 1|Ip| \u2211 i\u2208Ip t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j  yq, and that \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j is constant for i \u2208 Ip. So one can conclude that n\u2211 j=1 A\u0302i,j x\u0302j = t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j x\u0302j = t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq A\u0302i,j  yq \u25e6i bi, \u2200 i \u2208 Ip, which leads to A\u0302x\u0302 \u25e6\u0302 b\u0302. It can also be seen that l\u0302 = l \u2264 x\u0302 \u2264 u \u2264 u\u0302. Therefore, x\u0302 is feasible for (B.2). We have shown above that the feasibility of (B.1) implies the feasibility of (B.2). The inverse is also true by the same reasoning. Hence, we complete the proof. Lemma B.3. If two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems are indistinguishable by the WL test, then these two problems share the same optimal objective value (could be \u221e or \u2212\u221e). Proof of Lemma B.3. If both problems are infeasible, then their optimal objective values are both \u221e. We then consider the case that both problems are feasible. We use the same setting and notations as in Lemma B.2, and in addition we have that cj = c\u0302j , which is part of hWj = h\u0302 W j , is independent of j \u2208 Jq for any q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , t}. Suppose that x is an feasible solution to the problem (B.1) and let x\u0302 \u2208 Rn be defined via x\u0302j = 1|Jq| \u2211 j\u2032\u2208Jq xj\u2032 , j \u2208 Jq . It is guaranteed by the proof of Lemma B.2 that x\u0302 is a feasible solution to (B.2). One can also see that c\u22a4x = c\u0302\u22a4x\u0302. Since this holds for any feasible solution x to (B.1), the optimal value of the objective function for (B.2) is smaller than or equal to that for (B.1). The inverse is also true and the proof is completed. Lemma B.4. Suppose that two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems are indistinguishable by the WL test and the their optimal objective values are both finite. Then these two problems have the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm, up to permutation. Proof of Lemma B.4. We work with the same setting as in Lemma B.3, where permutations have already been applied. Let x and x\u2032 be the optimal solution to (B.1) and (B.2) with the smallest \u21132-norm, respectively. (Recall that the optimal solution to a LP problem with the smallest \u21132-norm is unique, see Remark 2.2.) Let x\u0302 \u2208 Rn be defined via x\u0302j = 1|Jq| \u2211 j\u2032\u2208Jq xj\u2032 for j \u2208 Jq , q = 1, 2, . . . , t. According to the arguments in the proof of Lemma B.2 and Lemma B.3, x\u0302 is an optimal solution to (B.2). The minimality of x\u2032 yields that \u2225x\u2032\u222522 \u2264 \u2225x\u0302\u222522 = t\u2211 q=1 |Jq|  1 |Jq| \u2211 j\u2208Jq xj 2 = t\u2211 q=1 1 |Jq| \u2211 j\u2208Jq xj 2 \u2264 t\u2211 q=1 \u2211 j\u2208Jq x2j = \u2225x\u222522, (B.3) which implies \u2225x\u2032\u2225 \u2264 \u2225x\u2225. The converse \u2225x\u2225 \u2264 \u2225x\u2032\u2225 is also true. Therefore, we must have \u2225x\u2225 = \u2225x\u2032\u2225 and hence, the inequalities in (B.3) must hold as equalities. Then one can conclude that xj = xj\u2032 for any j, j\u2032 \u2208 Jq and q = 1, 2, . . . , t, which leads to x = x\u0302. Furthermore, it follows from \u2225x\u2032\u2225 = \u2225x\u0302\u2225 and the uniqueness of x\u2032 (see Remark 2.2) that x\u2032 = x\u0302 = x, which completes the proof. One corollary one can see from the proof of Lemma B.4 is that the components of the optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm must be the same if the two corresponding vertices have the same color in the WL test. Corollary B.5. Let (G,H) be a weighted bipartite graph with vertex features and let x be the optimal solution to the corresponding LP problem with the smallest \u21132-norm. Suppose that for some j, j\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, one has Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 for any l \u2208 N and any choices of hash functions, then xj = xj\u2032 . Let us also define another equivalence relationship on Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn where colors of w1, w2, . . . , wj with ordering (not just multisets) are considered: Definition B.6. Given (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn , (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) are not in the same equivalence class of W\u223c if and only if there exist some L \u2208 N and some hash functions HASH0,V , HASH0,W , HASHl,V , HASHl,W , HASH\u2032l,V , and HASH \u2032 l,W , l = 1, 2, . . . , L, such that {{CL,V1 , C L,V 2 , . . . , C L,V m }} \u0338= {{C\u0302 L,V 1 , C\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , C\u0302 L,V m }} or C l,W j \u0338= C\u0302 l,W j for some j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. It is clear that (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) implies (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). One can actually obtain a stronger version of Lemma B.4 given (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Corollary B.7. Suppose that two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features corresponding to two LP problems, (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), satisfies that (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Then these two problems have the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Proof of Corollary B.7. The proof of Lemma B.4 still applies with the difference that there is no permutation on {w1, w2, . . . , wn}. Proof of Theorem 4.1. The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows immediately from Lemmas B.2, B.3 and B.4. C SEPARATION POWER OF GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS: This section aims to prove Theorem 4.2, i.e., the separation power of GNNs is equivalent to that of the WL test. Similar results can be found in previous literature, see e.g. Xu et al. (2019); Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). We first introduce some lemmas that can directly imply Theorem 4.2. The lemma below, similar to (Xu et al., 2019, Lemma 2), states that the separation power of GNNs is at most that of the WL test. Lemma C.1. Let (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . If (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), then for any FW \u2208 FWGNN, there exists a permutation \u03c3W \u2208 Sn such that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)). Proof of Lemma C.1. First we describe the sketch of our proof. The assumption (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) implies that, if we apply the WL test on (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), the test results should be exactly the same whatever the hash functions in the WL test we choose. In the first step, we define a set of hash functions that are injective on all possible inputs. Second, we show that, if we apply an arbitrarily chosen GNN: FW \u2208 FWGNN on (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302), the vertex features of the two graphs are exactly the same up to permutation, given the fact that the WL test results are the same. Finally, it concludes that FW (G,H) should be the same with FW (G\u0302, H\u0302) up to permutation. Let us first define hash functions. We choose HASH0,V and HASH0,W that are injective on the following sets (not multisets) respectively: {hV1 , . . . , hVm, h\u0302V1 , . . . , h\u0302Vm} and {hW1 , . . . , hWn , h\u0302W1 , . . . , h\u0302Wn }. Let {Cl\u22121,Vi }mi=1, {C l\u22121,W j }nj=1 and {C\u0302 l\u22121,V i }mi=1, {C\u0302 l\u22121,W j }nj=1 be the vertex colors in the (l\u22121)th iteration (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) in the WL test for (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) respectively. Define two sets (not multisets) that collect different colors: CVl\u22121 = {C l\u22121,V 1 , . . . , C l\u22121,V m , C\u0302 l\u22121,V 1 , . . . , C\u0302 l\u22121,V m }, and CWl\u22121 = {C l\u22121,W 1 , . . . , C l\u22121,W n , C\u0302 l\u22121,W 1 , . . . , C\u0302 l\u22121,W n }. The hash function HASH\u2032l,V and HASH \u2032 l,W are chosen such that the outputs are located in some linear spaces and that {HASH\u2032l,V (C) : C \u2208 CVl\u22121} and {HASH \u2032 l,W (C) : C \u2208 CWl\u22121} are both linearly independent. Finally, we choose hash functions HASHl,V and HASHl,W such that HASHl,V is injective on the set (not multiset) Cl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  \u222a  C\u0302l\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( C\u0302l\u22121,Wj ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  , and that HASHl,W is injective on the set (not multiset){( Cl\u22121,Wj , n\u2211 i=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,V ( Cl\u22121,Vi )) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n } \u222a {( C\u0302l\u22121,Wj , n\u2211 i=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,V ( C\u0302l\u22121,Vi )) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n } . Those hash functions give the vertex colors at the next iteration (l-th layer): {Cl,Vi }mi=1, {C l,W j }nj=1 and {C\u0302l,Vi }mi=1, {C\u0302 l,W j }nj=1. Consider any FW \u2208 FWGNN and let {h l\u22121,V i }mi=1, {h l\u22121,W j }nj=1 and {h\u0302 l\u22121,V i }mi=1, {h\u0302 l\u22121,W j }nj=1 be the vertex features in the l-th layer (0 \u2264 l \u2264 L) of the graph neural network FW . (Update rule refers to equations (2.1),(2.2),(2.3),(2.5)) We aim to prove by induction that for any l \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , L}, the followings hold: (i) Cl,Vi = C l,V i\u2032 implies h l,V i = h l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (ii) C\u0302l,Vi = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies h\u0302 l,V i = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iii) Cl,Vi = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies h l,V i = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iv) Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 implies h l,W j = h l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (v) C\u0302l,Wj = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies h\u0302 l,W j = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (vi) Cl,Wj = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies h l,W j = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n. The above claims (i)-(vi) are clearly true for l = 0 due to the injectivity of HASH0,V and HASH0,W . Now we assume that (i)-(vi) are true for some l\u22121 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , L\u22121}. Suppose that Cl,Vi = C l,V i\u2032 , i.e., HASHl,V Cl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) = HASHl,V Cl\u22121,Vi\u2032 , n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) , for some 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m. It follows from the injectivity of HASHl,V that Cl\u22121,Vi = C l\u22121,V i\u2032 , (C.1) and n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) = n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) . According to the linearly independent property of HASH\u2032l,W , the above equation implies that\u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei,j = \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei\u2032,j , \u2200 C \u2208 CWl\u22121. (C.2) Note that the induction assumption guarantees that hl\u22121,Wj = h l\u22121,W j\u2032 as long as C l\u22121,W j = C l\u22121,W j\u2032 . So one can assign for each C \u2208 CWl\u22121 some h(C) \u2208 Rdl\u22121 such that h l\u22121,W j = h(C) as long as Cl\u22121,Wj = C for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Therefore, it follows from (C.2) that n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) = \u2211 C\u2208CWl\u22121 \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei,jf W l (h(C)) = \u2211 C\u2208CWl\u22121 \u2211 Cl\u22121,Wj =C Ei\u2032,jf W l (h(C)) = n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ). Note also that (C.1) and the induction assumption lead to hl\u22121,Vi = h l\u22121,V i\u2032 . Then one can conclude that hl,Vi = g V l hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  = gVl hl\u22121,Vi\u2032 , n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  = hl,Vi\u2032 . This proves the claim (i) for l. The other five claims can be proved using similar arguments. Therefore, we obtain from (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302) that{{ hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m }} = {{ h\u0302L,V1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m }} , and that {{ hL,W1 , h L,W 2 , . . . , h L,W n }} = {{ h\u0302L,W1 , h\u0302 L,W 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,W n }} . By the definition of the output layer, the above conclusion guarantees that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)) for some \u03c3W \u2208 Sn. Lemma C.2. Let (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn . Suppose that for any FW \u2208 FWGNN, there exists a permutation \u03c3W \u2208 Sn such that FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)). Then F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for any F \u2208 FGNN. Proof of Lemma C.2. Pick an arbitrary F \u2208 FGNN. We choose FW \u2208 FWGNN such that FW (G \u2032, H \u2032) = (F (G\u2032, H \u2032), . . . , F (G\u2032, H \u2032)) \u22a4 \u2208 Rn, \u2200 (G\u2032, H \u2032) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Note that every entry in the output of FW is equal to the output of F . Thus, it follows from FW (G,H) = \u03c3W (FW (G\u0302, H\u0302)) that F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302). The next lemma is similar to (Xu et al., 2019, Theorem 3) and states that the separation power of GNNs is at least that of the WL test. Lemma C.3. Let (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn . If F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for any F \u2208 FGNN, then (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Proof of Lemma C.3. It suffices to prove that, if (G,H) can be distinguished from (G\u0302, H\u0302) by the WL test, then there exists F \u2208 FGNN, such that F (G,H) \u0338= F (G\u0302, H\u0302). The distinguish-ability of the WL test implies that there exists L \u2208 N and hash functions, HASH0,V , HASH0,W , HASHl,V , HASHl,W , HASH\u2032l,V , and HASH \u2032 l,W , for l = 1, 2, . . . , L, such that{{ CL,V1 , C L,V 2 , . . . , C L,V m }} \u0338= {{ C\u0302L,V1 , C\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , C\u0302 L,V m }} , (C.3) or {{ CL,W1 , C L,W 2 , . . . , C L,W n }} \u0338= {{ C\u0302L,W1 , C\u0302 L,W 2 , . . . , C\u0302 L,W n }} , (C.4) We aim to construct some GNNs such that the followings hold for any l = 0, 1, . . . , L: (i) hl,Vi = h l,V i\u2032 implies C l,V i = C l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (ii) h\u0302l,Vi = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies C\u0302 l,V i = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iii) hl,Vi = h\u0302 l,V i\u2032 implies C l,V i = C\u0302 l,V i\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 \u2264 m; (iv) hl,Wj = h l,W j\u2032 implies C l,W j = C l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (v) h\u0302l,Wj = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies C\u0302 l,W j = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n; (vi) hl,Wj = h\u0302 l,W j\u2032 implies C l,W j = C\u0302 l,W j\u2032 , for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 n. It is clear that the above conditions (i)-(vi) hold for l = 0 as long as we choose fVin and f W in that are injective on the following two sets (not multisets) respectively: {hV1 , . . . , hVm, h\u0302V1 , . . . , h\u0302Vm} and {hW1 , . . . , hWn , h\u0302W1 , . . . , h\u0302Wn }. We then assume that (i)-(vi) hold for some 0 \u2264 l \u2212 1 < L, and show that these conditions are also satisfied for l if we choose fVl , f W l , g V i , g W l properly. Let us consider the set (not multiset): {\u03b11, \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1s} \u2282 Rdl\u22121 that collects all different values in hl\u22121,W1 , h l\u22121,W 2 , . . . , h l\u22121,W n , h\u0302 l\u22121,W 1 , h\u0302 l\u22121,W 2 , . . . , h\u0302 l\u22121,W n . Let dl \u2265 s and let edlp = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) be the vector in Rdl with the p-th entry being 1 and all other entries being 0, for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 s. Choose fWl : Rdl\u22121 \u2192 Rdl as a continuous function satisfying fWl (\u03b1p) = e dl p , p = 1, 2, . . . , s, and choose g V l : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u2192 Rdl that is continuous and is injective when restricted on the set (not multiset) hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  \u222a  h\u0302l\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 E\u0302i,jf W l (h\u0302 l\u22121,W j )  : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m  . Noticing that n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) = s\u2211 p=1  \u2211 hl\u22121,Wj =\u03b1p Ei,j  edlp , and that {edl1 , e dl 2 , . . . , e dl s } is linearly independent, one can conclude that h l,V i = h l,V i\u2032 if and only if hl\u22121,Vi = h l\u22121,V i\u2032 and \u2211n j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ) = \u2211n j=1 Ei\u2032,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j ), where the second condition is equivalent to\u2211 hl\u22121,Wj =\u03b1p Ei,j = \u2211 hl\u22121,Wj =\u03b1p Ei\u2032,j , \u2200 p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s}. This, as well as the condition (iv) for l \u2212 1, implies that n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) = n\u2211 j=1 Ei\u2032,jHASH\u2032l,W ( Cl\u22121,Wj ) , and hence that Cl,Vi = C l,V i\u2032 by using h l\u22121,V i = h l\u22121,V i and condition (i) for l \u2212 1. Therefore, we know that (i) is satisfied for l, and one can show (ii) and (iii) for l using similar arguments by taking dl large enough. In addition, fVl and g W l can also be chosen in a similar way such that (iv)-(vi) are satisfied for l. Combining (C.3), (C.4), and condition (i)-(iv) for L, we obtain that{{ hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m }} \u0338= {{ h\u0302L,V1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m }} , (C.5) or {{ hL,W1 , h L,W 2 , . . . , h L,W n }} \u0338= {{ h\u0302L,W1 , h\u0302 L,W 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,W n }} . Without loss of generality, we can assume that (C.5) holds. Consider the set (not multiset) {\u03b21, \u03b22, . . . , \u03b2t} \u2282 RdL , that collects all different values in hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m , h\u0302 L,V 1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m . Let k > 1 be a positive integer that is greater than the maximal multiplicity of an element in the multisets {{hL,V1 , h L,V 2 , . . . , h L,V m }} and {{h\u0302 L,V 1 , h\u0302 L,V 2 , . . . , h\u0302 L,V m }}. There exists a continuous function \u03c6 : RdL \u2192 R such that \u03c6(\u03b2q) = kq for q = 1, 2, . . . , t, and due to (C.5) and the fact that the way of writing an integer as k-ary expression is unique, it hence holds that m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(hL,Vi ) \u0338= m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(h\u0302L,Vi ). Set the dimension of (L + 1)-th layer as 1: dL+1 = 1, and set fL+1,V = 0, fL+1,W = 0, gL+1,V (h, 0) = \u03c6(h), and gL+1,W = 0. Then we have h L+1,V i = \u03c6(h L,V i ), h\u0302 L+1,V i = \u03c6(h\u0302 L,V i ), and hL+1,Wj = h\u0302 L+1,W j for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m and j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. Define fout : R \u00d7 R \u2192 R via fout(h, h \u2032) = h. Then it follows that fout  m\u2211 i=1 hL+1,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL+1,Wj  = m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(hL,Vi ) \u0338= m\u2211 i=1 \u03c6(h\u0302L,Vi ) = fout  m\u2211 i=1 h\u0302L+1,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 h\u0302L+1,Wj  , which guarantees the existence of F \u2208 FGNN that has L + 1 layers and satisfies F (G,H) \u0338= F (G\u0302, H\u0302). Proof of Theorem 4.2. The equivalence of the three conditions follow immediately from Lemma C.1, C.2, and C.3. Corollary C.4. For any two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , the followings are equivalent: (i) (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). (ii) For any FW \u2208 FWGNN, it holds that FW (G,H) = FW (G\u0302, H\u0302). Proof of Corollary C.4. The proof follows similar lines as in the proof of Theorem 4.2 with the difference that there is no permutation on {w1, w2, . . . , wn}. In addition to the separation power of GNNs for two weighted bipartite graphs with vertex features, one can also obtain results on separating different vertices in one weighted bipartite graph with vertex features. Corollary C.5. For any weighted bipartite graph with vertex features (G,H) and any j, j\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the followings are equivalent: (i) Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 holds for any l \u2208 N and any choice of hash functions. (ii) FW (G,H)j = FW (G,H)j\u2032 , \u2200 FW \u2208 FWGNN. Proof of Corollary C.5. \u201c(i) =\u21d2 (ii)\u201d and \u201c(ii) =\u21d2 (i)\u201d can be proved using similar arguments in the proof of Lemma C.1 and Lemma C.3, respectively. D UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION OF FGNN This section provides the proof of Theorem 4.3. The main mathematical tool used in the proof is the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem: Theorem D.1 (Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem (Rudin, 1991, Section 5.7)). Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and let F \u2282 C(X,R) be a subalgebra. If F separates points on X , i.e., for any x, x\u2032 \u2208 X with x \u0338= x\u2032, there exists F \u2208 F such that F (x) \u0338= F (x\u2032), and 1 \u2208 F , then F is dense in C(X,R) with the topology of uniform convergence. Proof of Theorem 4.3. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 X/ \u223c be the quotient map, where \u03c0(X) = X/ \u223c is equipped with the quotient topology. For any F \u2208 FGNN, since F : X \u2192 R is continuous and by Theorem 4.2, F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), there exists a unique continuous F\u0303 : \u03c0(X) \u2192 R such that F = F\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c0. Set F\u0303GNN = { F\u0303 : F \u2208 FGNN } \u2282 C(\u03c0(X),R). In addition, the assumption on \u03a6, i.e, \u03a6(G,H) = \u03a6(G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302), leads to the existence of a unique \u03a6\u0303 \u2208 C(\u03c0(X),R) with \u03a6 = \u03a6\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c0. Since X is compact, then \u03c0(X) is also compact due to the continuity of \u03c0. According to Lemma D.2 below, F\u0303GNN is a subalgebra of C(\u03c0(X),R). By Theorem 4.2, F\u0303GNN separates points on \u03c0(X). This can further imply that \u03c0(X) is Hausdorff. In fact, for any x, x\u2032 \u2208 \u03c0(X), there exists F\u0303 \u2208 F\u0303GNN with F\u0303 (x) \u0338= F\u0303 (x\u2032). Without loss of generality, we assume that F\u0303 (x) < F\u0303 (x\u2032) and choose some c \u2208 R with F\u0303 (x) < c < F\u0303 (x\u2032). By continuity of F\u0303 , we know that F\u0303\u22121((\u2212\u221e, c)) \u2229 \u03c0(X) and F\u0303\u22121((c,+\u221e)) \u2229 \u03c0(X) are disjoint open subsets of \u03c0(X) with x \u2208 F\u0303\u22121((\u2212\u221e, c)) \u2229 \u03c0(X) and x\u2032 \u2208 F\u0303\u22121((c,+\u221e)) \u2229 \u03c0(X), which leads to the Hausdorff property of \u03c0(X). Note also that 1 \u2208 F\u0303GNN. Using Theorem D.1, we can conclude the denseness of F\u0303GNN in C(\u03c0(X),R). Therefore, for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 FGNN, such that sup (G,H)\u2208X |\u03a6(G,H)\u2212 F (G,H)| = sup x\u2208\u03c0(X) |\u03a6\u0303(x)\u2212 F\u0303 (x)| < \u03f5, which completes the proof. Lemma D.2. FGNN is a subalgebra of C(Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn ,R), and as a corollary, F\u0303GNN is a subalgebra of C(Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn / \u223c,R). Proof of Lemma D.2. It suffices to show that FGNN is closed under addition and multiplication. Consider any F, F\u0302 \u2208 FGNN. Thanks to Lemma D.3, we can assume that both F and F\u0302 have L layers. Suppose that F is constructed by fVin : HV \u2192 Rd0 , fWin : HW \u2192 Rd0 , fVl , f W l : Rdl\u22121 \u2192 Rdl , gVl , gWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u2192 Rdl , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 L, fout : RdL \u00d7 RdL \u2192 R, and that F\u0302 is constructed by f\u0302Vin : HV \u2192 Rd\u03020 , f\u0302Win : HW \u2192 Rd\u03020 , f\u0302Vl , f\u0302 W l : Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u2192 Rd\u0302l , g\u0302Vl , g\u0302Wl : Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l \u2192 Rd\u0302l , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 L, f\u0302out : Rd\u0302L \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u2192 R. One can then construct two new GNNs computing F + F\u0302 and F \u00b7 F\u0302 as follows: The input layer The update rule of the input layer is defined by fVin : HV \u2192 Rd0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , h 7\u2192 ( fVin (h), f\u0302 V in (h) ) , fWin : HW \u2192 Rd0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , h 7\u2192 ( fWin (h), f\u0302 W in (h) ) . Then the vertex features after the computation of the input layer h0,Vi and h 0,W j are given by: h0,Vi = f V in (h V i ) = ( fVin (h V i ), f\u0302 V in (h V i ) ) = (h0,Vi , h\u0302 0,V i ) \u2208 R d0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , h0,Wj = f W in (h W j ) = ( fWin (h W j ), f\u0302 W in (h W j ) ) = (h0,Wj , h\u0302 0,W j ) \u2208 R d0 \u00d7 Rd\u03020 , for i = 1, 2 . . . ,m, and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The l-th layer (1 \u2264 l \u2264 L) . We set fVl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302) 7\u2192 ( fVl (h), f\u0302 V l (h\u0302) ) , fWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302) 7\u2192 ( fWl (h), f\u0302 W l (h\u0302) ) , gVl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302, h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032) 7\u2192 ( gWl (h, h \u2032), g\u0302Wl (h\u0302, h\u0302 \u2032) ) , and gWl : Rdl\u22121 \u00d7 Rd\u0302l\u22121 \u00d7 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l \u2192 Rdl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , (h, h\u0302, h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032) 7\u2192 ( gVl (h, h \u2032), g\u0302Vl (h\u0302, h\u0302 \u2032) ) . Then the vertex features after the computation of the l-th layer hl,Vi and h l,W j are given by: hl,Vi = g V l hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  = gVl hl\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,jf W l (h l\u22121,W j )  , g\u0302Vl h\u0302l\u22121,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 Ei,j f\u0302 W l (h\u0302 l\u22121,W j )  = (hl,Vi , h\u0302 l,V i ) \u2208 R dl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , and hl,Wj = g W l ( hl\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,jf V l (h l\u22121,V i ) ) = ( gWl ( hl\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,jf V l (h l\u22121,V i ) ) , g\u0302Wl ( h\u0302l\u22121,Wj , m\u2211 i=1 Ei,j f\u0302 V l (h\u0302 l\u22121,V i ) )) = (hl,Wj , h\u0302 l,W j ) \u2208 R dl \u00d7 Rd\u0302l , for i = 1, 2 . . . ,m, and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The output layer To obtain F + F\u0302 , we set faddout : RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u00d7 RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u2192 R, ((h, h\u0302), (h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032)) 7\u2192 fout(h, h\u2032) + f\u0302out(h\u0302, h\u0302\u2032). Then it holds that faddout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,W1  =fout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj + f\u0302out  m\u2211 i=1 h\u0302L,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 h\u0302L,Wj  =F (G,H) + F\u0302 (G,H). To obtain F \u00b7 F\u0302 , we set fmultiplyout : RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u00d7 RdL \u00d7 Rd\u0302L \u2192 R, ((h, h\u0302), (h\u2032, h\u0302\u2032)) 7\u2192 fout(h, h\u2032) \u00b7 f\u0302out(h\u0302, h\u0302\u2032). Then it holds that fmultiplyout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,W1  =fout  m\u2211 i=1 hL,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 hL,Wj  \u00b7 f\u0302out  m\u2211 i=1 h\u0302L,Vi , n\u2211 j=1 h\u0302L,Wj  =F (G,H) \u00b7 F\u0302 (G,H). The constructed GNNs satisfy F (G,H) + F\u0302 (G,H) \u2208 FGNN and F (G,H) \u00b7 F\u0302 (G,H) \u2208 FGNN, which finishes the proof. Lemma D.3. If F \u2208 FGNN has L layers, then there exists F\u0302 \u2208 FGNN with L + 1 layers such that F = F\u0302 . Proof of Lemma D.3. Suppose that F is constructed by fVin , f W in , fout, {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0. We choose fVL+1 \u2261 0, fWL+1 \u2261 0, gVL+1(h, h\u2032) = h, gWL+1(h, h\u2032) = h. Let F\u0302 be constructed by fVin , f W in , fout, {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl } L+1 l=0 . Then F\u0302 has L+ 1 layers with F\u0302 = F . E UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION OF FWGNN This section provides an universal approximation result of FWGNN. Theorem E.1. Let X \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn be a compact subset that is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn. Suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 C(X,Rn) satisfies the followings: (i) For any \u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, and (G,H) \u2208 X , it holds that \u03a6 ((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (G,H)) = \u03c3W (\u03a6(G,H)). (E.1) (ii) \u03a6(G,H) = \u03a6(G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for all (G,H), (G\u0302, H\u0302) \u2208 X with (G,H) W\u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). (iii) Given any (G,H) \u2208 X and any j, j\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, if Cl,Wj = C l,W j\u2032 (the vertex colors obtained in the l-th iteration in WL test) holds for any l \u2208 N and any choices of hash functions, then \u03a6(G,H)j = \u03a6(G,H)j\u2032 . Then for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 FWGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208X \u2225\u03a6(G,H)\u2212 F (G,H)\u2225 < \u03f5. Theorem E.1 is a LP-graph version of results on the closure of equivariant GNN class in Azizian & Lelarge (2021); Geerts & Reutter (2022). The main tool in the proof of Theorem E.1 is the following generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem for equivariant functions established in Azizian & Lelarge (2021). Theorem E.2 (Generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem (Azizian & Lelarge, 2021, Theorem 22)). Let X be a compact topology space and let G be a finite group that acts continuously on X and Rn. Define the collection of all equivariant continuous functions from X to Rn as follows: CE(X,Rn) = {F \u2208 C(X,Rn) : F (g \u2217 x) = g \u2217 F (x), \u2200 x \u2208 X, g \u2208 G}. Consider any F \u2282 CE(X,Rn) and any \u03a6 \u2208 CE(X,Rn). Suppose the following conditions hold: (i) F is a subalgebra of C(X,Rn) and 1 \u2208 F . (ii) For any x, x\u2032 \u2208 X , if f(x) = f(x\u2032) holds for any f \u2208 C(X,R) with f1 \u2208 F , then for any F \u2208 F , there exists g \u2208 G such that F (x) = g \u2217 F (x\u2032). (iii) For any x, x\u2032 \u2208 X , if F (x) = F (x\u2032) holds for any F \u2208 F , then \u03a6(x) = \u03a6(x\u2032). (iv) For any x \u2208 X , it holds that \u03a6(x)j = \u03a6(x)j\u2032 , \u2200 (j, j\u2032) \u2208 J(x), where J(x) = {{1, 2, . . . , n}n : F (x)j = F (x)j\u2032 , \u2200 F \u2208 F}. Then for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists F \u2208 F such that sup x\u2208X \u2225\u03a6(x)\u2212 F (x)\u2225 < \u03f5. We refer to Timofte (2005) for different versions of Stone-Weierstrass theorem, that is also used in Azizian & Lelarge (2021). In the proof of Theorem E.1, we also need the following lemma whose proof is almost the same as the proof of Lemma D.2 and is hence omitted. Lemma E.3. FWGNN is a subalgebra of C(Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn ,Rn). Proof of Theorem E.1. Let Sm \u00d7 Sn act on Rn via (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 y = \u03c3W (y), \u2200 \u03c3V \u2208 Sm, \u03c3W \u2208 Sn, y \u2208 Rn. Then it follows from (E.1) that \u03a6 is equivariant. In addition, the definition of graph neural networks directly guarantees the equivariance of functions in FWGNN. Therefore, one only needs to verify the conditions with F as FWGNN and G as Sn in Theorem E.2: \u2022 Condition (i) in Theorem E.2 follows from Lemma E.3 and the definition of FWGNN. \u2022 Condition (ii) in Theorem E.2 follows from Theorem 4.2 and FGNN1 \u2282 FWGNN. \u2022 Condition (iii) in Theorem E.2 follows from Corollary C.4 and Condition (ii) in Theorem E.1. \u2022 Condition (iv) in Theorem E.2 follows from Corollary C.5 and Condition (iii) in Theorem E.1. It finishes the proof. F PROOF OF MAIN THEOREMS: We collect the proofs of main theorems stated in Section 3 in this section. Proof of Theorem 3.1. If F (G,H) = F (G\u0302, H\u0302) holds for any F \u2208 FGNN, then Theorem 4.2 guarantees that (G,H) \u223c (G\u0302, H\u0302). Thus, Condition (i), (ii), and (iii) follow directly from Lemmas B.2, B.3, and B.4, respectively. Furthermore, if FW (G,H) = FW (G\u0302, H\u0302), \u2200 FW \u2208 FWGNN, then it follows from Corollary C.4 and Corollary B.7 that the two LP problems associated to (G,H) and (G\u0302, H\u0302) share the same optimal solution with the smallest \u21132-norm. Then we head into the proof of three main approximation theorems, say Theorem 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6, that state that GNNs can approximate the feasibility mapping \u03a6feas, the optimal objective value mapping \u03a6obj, and the optimal solution mapping \u03a6solu with arbitrarily small error, respectively. We have established in Sections D and E several theorems for graph neural networks to approximate continuous mappings. Therefore, the proof of Theorem 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6 basically consists of two steps: (i) Show that the mappings \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu are measurable. (ii) Use continuous mappings to approximate the target measurable mappings, and then apply the universal approximation results established in Sections D and E. Let us first prove the feasibility of \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu in the following three lemmas. Lemma F.1. The feasibility mapping \u03a6feas defined in (2.7) is measurable, i.e., the preimages \u03a6\u22121feas(0) and \u03a6\u22121feas(1) are both measurable subsets of Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn . Proof of Lemma F.1. It suffices to prove that for any \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m and any Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the set Xfeas := {(A, b, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : \u2203 x \u2208 Rn, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu}, is a measurable subset in Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu|. Without loss of generality, we assume that \u25e6 = (\u2264, . . . ,\u2264,=, . . . ,=,\u2265, . . . ,\u2265) where \u201c\u2264\u201d, \u201c=\u201d, and \u201c\u2265\u201d appear for k1, k2 \u2212 k1, and m\u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 times, respectively, 0 \u2264 k1 \u2264 k2 \u2264 m. Let us define a function Vfeas : Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| \u00d7 Rn \u2192 R\u22650 that measures to what extend a point in Rn violates the constraints: Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) = max  max1\u2264i\u2264k1  n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj \u2212 bi  + , max k1<i\u2264k2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj \u2212 bi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , max k2<i\u2264m bi \u2212 n\u2211 j=1 Ai,jxj  + , max j\u2208Nl (lj \u2212 xj)+, max j\u2208Nu (xj \u2212 uj)+  , where y+ = max{y, 0}. It can be seen that Vfeas is continuous and Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) = 0 if and only if Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, and xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu. Therefore, for any (A, b, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu|, the followings are equivalent: \u2022 (A, b, l, u) \u2208 Xfeas. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 N+ and x \u2208 BR := {x\u2032 \u2208 Rn : \u2225x\u2032\u2225 \u2264 R}, such that Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) = 0. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 N+ such that for any r \u2208 N+, Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) \u2264 1/r holds for some x \u2208 BR \u2229Qn. This implies that Xfeas can be described via\u22c3 R\u2208N+ \u22c2 r\u2208N+ \u22c3 x\u2208BR\u2229Qn { (A, b, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) \u2264 1 r } . Since Qn is countable and V is continuous, we immediately obtain from the above expression that Xfeas is measurable. Lemma F.2. The optimal objective value mapping \u03a6obj defined in (2.8) is measurable. Proof of Lemma F.2. It suffices to prove that for any \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m, any Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}, and any \u03d5 \u2208 R, the set Xobj := {(A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : \u2203 x \u2208 Rn, s.t. c\u22a4x \u2264 \u03d5, Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu}, is a measurable subset in Rm\u00d7n\u00d7Rm\u00d7Rn\u00d7R|Nl|\u00d7R|Nu|. Then the proof follows the same lines as in the proof of Lemma F.1, with a different violation function Vobj(A, b, c, l, u, x) = max { (c\u22a4x\u2212 \u03d5)+, Vfeas(A, b, l, u, x) } . Lemma F.3. The optimal solution mapping \u03a6solu defined in (2.9) is measurable. Proof of Lemma F.3. It suffices to show that for every j0 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the mapping \u03c0j0 \u25e6 \u03a6solu : \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2192 R, is measurable, where \u03c0j0 : Rn \u2192 R maps a vector x \u2208 Rn to its j0-th component. Similar as before, one can consider any \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m, any Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}, and any \u03d5 \u2208 R, and prove that the set Xsolu := {(A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| : The LP problem, min x\u2208Rd c\u22a4x, s.t. Ax \u25e6 b, xj \u2265 lj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nl, xj \u2264 uj , \u2200 j \u2208 Nu, has a finite optimal objective value, and its optimal solution with the smallest \u21132 \u2212 norm, xopt, satisfies (xopt)j0 < \u03d5}, is measurable. Note that we have fixed \u25e6 \u2208 {\u2264,=\u2265}m and Nl, Nu \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let \u03b9 : Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R|Nl| \u00d7 R|Nu| \u2192 Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn , be the embedding map. Define another violation function Vsolu : (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R)\u00d7 Rn \u2192 R, via Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) = max {( c\u22a4x\u2212 \u03a6obj(\u03b9(A, b, c, l, u)) ) + , Vfeas(A, b, c, l, u, x) } , which is measurable due to the measurability of \u03a6obj and the continuity of Vfeas. Moreover, Vsolu is continuous with respect to x. Therefore, the followings are equivalent for (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R): \u2022 (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 Xsolu. \u2022 There exists x \u2208 Rn with xj0 < \u03d5, such that Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) = 0 and Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) > 0, \u2200 x\u2032 \u2208 B\u2225x\u2225, x\u2032j0 \u2265 \u03d5. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 Q+, r \u2208 N+, and x \u2208 BR with xj0 \u2264 \u03d5\u22121/r, such that Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) = 0 and Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) > 0, \u2200 x\u2032 \u2208 BR, x\u2032j0 \u2265 \u03d5. \u2022 There exists R \u2208 Q+ and r \u2208 N+, such that for all r\u2032 \u2208 N+, \u2203 x \u2208 BR \u2229 Qn, xj0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2212 1/r, s.t. Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) < 1/r\u2032 and that \u2203 r\u2032\u2032 \u2208 N+, s.t., Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) \u2265 1/r\u2032\u2032, \u2200 x\u2032 \u2208 BR \u2229Qn, x\u2032j0 \u2265 \u03d5. Therefore, one has that Xsolu = \u22c3 R\u2208Q+ \u22c3 r\u2208N+ \u22c2 r\u2032\u2208N+ \u22c3 x\u2208BR\u2229Qn, xj0\u2264\u03d5\u2212 1 r { (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R) : Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x) < 1 r\u2032 } \u2229  \u22c3 r\u2032\u2032\u2208N+ \u22c2 x\u2032\u2208BR\u2229Qn, x\u2032j0\u2265\u03d5 { (A, b, c, l, u) \u2208 (\u03a6obj \u25e6 \u03b9)\u22121(R) : Vsolu(A, b, c, l, u, x\u2032) \u2265 1 r\u2032\u2032 } , which is measurable. With the measurability of \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu established, the next step is to approximate \u03a6feas, \u03a6obj, and \u03a6solu using continuous mappings, and hence graph neural networks. Before proceeding, let us mention that Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn is essentially the disjoint union of finitely many product spaces of Euclidean spaces and discrete spaces that have finitely many points and are equipped with discrete measures. More specifically, Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn \u223c= Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 (R\u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265})m \u00d7 (R\u00d7 (R \u222a {\u2212\u221e})\u00d7 (R \u222a {+\u221e}))n \u223c= n\u22c3 k,k\u2032=0 (nk)\u22c3 s=1 (nk\u2032)\u22c3 s\u2032=1 Rm\u00d7n \u00d7 Rm \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 Rn\u2212k \u00d7 Rn\u2212k \u2032 \u00d7 {\u2264,=,\u2265}m \u00d7 {\u2212\u221e}k \u00d7 {+\u221e}k \u2032 . Therefore, many results in real analysis for Euclidean spaces still apply for Gm,n \u00d7HVm \u00d7HWn and Meas(\u00b7), including the following Lusin\u2019s theorem. Theorem F.4 (Lusin\u2019s theorem (Evans & Garzepy, 2018, Theorem 1.14)). Let \u00b5 be a Borel regular measure on Rn and let f : Rn \u2192 Rm be \u00b5-measurable. Then for any \u00b5-measurable X \u2282 Rn with \u00b5(X) < \u221e and any \u03f5 > 0, there exists a compact set E \u2282 X with \u00b5(X\\E) < \u03f5, such that f |E is continuous. Proof of Theorem 3.2. Since X \u2282 Gm,n\u00d7HVm\u00d7HWn is measurable with finite measure, according to Lusin\u2019s theorem, there is a compact set E \u2282 X such that \u03a6feas|E is continuous with Meas(X\\E) < \u03f5. By Lemma B.2 and Theorem 4.3, there exists F \u2208 FGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208E |F (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6feas(G,H)| < 1 2 , which implies that IF (G,H)>1/2 = \u03a6feas(G,H), \u2200 (G,H) \u2208 E. Therefore, one obtains Meas ({ (G,H) \u2208 X : IF (G,H)>1/2 \u0338= \u03a6feas(G,H) }) \u2264 Meas(X\\E) < \u03f5, and the proof is completed. Proof of Corollary 3.3. As a finite set, D is compact and \u03a6feas|D is continuous. The rest of the proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.2, using Lemma B.2 and Theorem 4.3. Proof of Theorem 3.4. (i) The proof follows the same lines as in the proof of Theorem 3.2, with the difference that we approximate \u03a6(G,H) = { 1, if \u03a6obj(G,H) \u2208 R, 0, otherwise, instead of \u03a6feas and we use Lemma B.3 instead of Lemma B.2. (ii) The proof is still similar to that of Theorem 3.2. By Lusin\u2019s theorem, there is a compact set E \u2282 X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) such that \u03a6obj|E is continuous with Meas ( (X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R))\\E ) < \u03f5. Using Lemma B.3 and Theorem 4.3, there exists F2 \u2208 FGNN with sup (G,H)\u2208E |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| < \u03b4, which implies that Meas ({(G,H) \u2208 X : |F2(G,H)\u2212 \u03a6obj(G,H)| > \u03b4}) \u2264 Meas ( (X \u2229 \u03a6\u22121obj (R))\\E ) < \u03f5. Proof of Corollary 3.5. The results can be proved using similar techniques as in Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.4 by noticing that any finite dataset is compact on which any real-valued function is continuous. Proof of Theorem 3.6. Without loss of generality, we can assume that X \u2282 \u03a6\u22121obj (R) \u2282 Gm,n \u00d7 HVm \u00d7 HWn is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn; otherwise, we can replace X by\u22c3 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217X . By Lusin\u2019s theorem, there exists a compact subset E \u2032 \u2282 X such that Meas(A\\X) < \u03f5/|Sm \u00d7 Sn| and that \u03a6solu|E\u2032 is continuous. Define another compact set: E = \u22c2 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn (\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 E\u2032 \u2282 X, which is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn and satisfies Meas(X\\E) \u2264 \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn Meas(X\\(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 E\u2032) = \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn Meas((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217X\\(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 E\u2032) = \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn \u00b5((\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 (X\\E\u2032)) = \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn \u00b5(X\\E\u2032) < \u2211 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn \u03f5 |Sm \u00d7 Sn| = \u03f5. Note that the three conditions in Theorem E.1 are satisfied by the definition of \u03a6solu, Corollary B.7, and Corollary B.6, respectively. Using Theorem E.1, there exists FW \u2208 FWGNN such that sup (G,H)\u2208E \u2225FW (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 < \u03b4. Therefore, it holds that Meas ({(G,H) \u2208 X : \u2225FW (G,H)\u2212 \u03a6solu(G,H)\u2225 > \u03b4}) \u2264 Meas(X\\E) < \u03f5, which completes the proof. Proof of Corollary 3.7. One can assume that D is closed under the action of Sm \u00d7 Sn; otherwise, a larger but still finite dataset, \u22c3 (\u03c3V ,\u03c3W )\u2208Sm\u00d7Sn(\u03c3V , \u03c3W ) \u2217 D, can be considered instead of D. The rest of the proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.6 since D is compact and \u03a6solu|D is continuous. G DETAILS OF THE NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS: LP instance generation We generate each LP with the following way. We set m = 10 and n = 50. Each matrix A is sparse with 100 nonzero elements whose positions are sampled uniformly and values are sampled normally. Each element in b, c are sampled i.i.d and uniformly from [\u22121, 1]. The variable bounds l, u are sampled with N (0, 10). If lj > uj , then we swap lj and uj for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Furthermore, we sample \u25e6i i.i.d with P(\u25e6i = \u201c \u2264 \u201d) = 0.7 and P(\u25e6i = \u201c = \u201d) = 0.3. With the generation approach above, the probability that each LP to be feasible is around 0.53. MLP architectures As we mentions in the main text, all the learnable functions in GNN are taken as MLPs. The input functions fVin , f W in have one hidden layer and other functions fout, f W out , {fVl , fWl , gVl , gWl }Ll=0 have two hidden layers. The embedding size d0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dL are uniformly taken as d that is chosen from {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512}. All the activation functions are ReLU. Training settings We use Adam Kingma & Ba (2014) as our training optimizer with learning rate of 0.0003. The loss function is taken as mean squared error. All the experiments are conducted on a Linux server with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8163 GPU and eight NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will review the paper \"On

Your contribution as a reviewer is paramount to creating an exciting and high-quality program. We ask that:\\n\\nYour reviews are timely and substantive.\\nYou follow the reviewing guidelines below.\u00a0\\nYou adhere to our Code of Ethics in your role as a reviewer. You must also adhere to our Code of Conduct.\\n\\nThis guide is intended to help you understand the ICLR 2023 decision process and your role within it. It contains:\\n\\nAn outline of the main reviewer tasks\\nStep-by-step reviewing instructions (especially relevant for reviewers that are new to ICLR)\\nReview examples\\nAn FAQ.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\nWe\u2019re counting on you\\nAs a reviewer you are central to the program creation process for ICLR 2023. Your Area Chairs (ACs), Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and the Program Chairs (PCs) will rely greatly on your expertise and your diligent and thorough reviews to make decisions on each paper. Therefore, your role as a reviewer is critical to ensuring a strong program for ICLR 2023.\\nHigh-quality reviews are also very valuable for helping authors improve their work, whether it is eventually accepted by ICLR 2023, or not. Therefore it is important to treat each valid ICLR 2023 submission with equal care.\\nAs a token of our appreciation for your essential work, top reviewers will be acknowledged permanently on the ICLR 2023 website. Furthermore, top and high quality reviewers will receive special acknowledgement during the opening ceremony and free registration to ICLR 2023.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nMain reviewer tasks\\nThe main reviewer tasks and dates are as follows:\\n\\nCreate or update your OpenReview profile (September 30 2022)\\nBid on papers (September 30 2022 - October 06 2022)\\nWrite a constructive, thorough and timely review (October 12 2022 - October 24 2022)\\nInitial paper reviews released (November 4 2022)\\nDiscuss with authors and other reviewers to clarify and improve the paper (November 4 2022 - November 18 2022)\\nFlag any potential CoE violations and/or concerns (by November 18 2022)\\nProvide a recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (by November 18 2022)\\nVirtual Meeting with AC if paper you reviewed falls into borderline papers (November 18 2022 - December 12 2022)\\nProvide a final recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (after Virtual Meeting)\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\nCode of Ethics\\nAll ICLR participants, including reviewers, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics). All reviewers are required to read the Code of Ethics and adhere to it. The Code of Ethics applies to all conference participation, including paper submission, reviewing, and paper discussion.\u00a0\\nAs part of the review process, reviewers are asked to raise potential violations of the ICLR Code of Ethics. Note that authors are encouraged to discuss questions and potential issues regarding the Code of Ethics as part of their submission. This discussion is not counted against the maximum page limit of the paper and should be included as a separate section.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReviewing a submission: step-by-step\\nSummarized in one sentence, a review aims to determine whether a submission will bring sufficient value to the community and contribute new knowledge. The process can be broken down into the following main reviewer tasks:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRead the paper: It\u2019s important to carefully read through the entire paper, and to look up any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself sufficient time for this step.\\nWhile reading, consider the following:\\n\\nObjective of the work: What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations as to potential value and impact.\\nStrong points: is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible, does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?\\nWeak points: is it weak in any of the aspects listed in b.?\\nBe mindful of potential biases and try to be open-minded about the value and interest a paper can hold for the entire ICLR community, even if it may not be very interesting for you.\\n\\n\\nAnswer four key questions for yourself, to make a recommendation to Accept or Reject:\\n\\nWhat is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?\\nIs the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\\nDoes the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\\nWhat is the significance of the work? Does it contribute new knowledge and sufficient value to the community? Note, this does not necessarily require state-of-the-art results. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge (incl., empirical, theoretical, for practitioners, etc).\\n\\n\\nWrite and submit your initial review, organizing it as follows:\u00a0\\n\\nSummarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.\\nList strong and weak points of the paper. Be as comprehensive as possible.\\nClearly state your initial recommendation (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\\nProvide supporting arguments for your recommendation.\\nAsk questions you would like answered by the authors to help you clarify your understanding of the paper and provide the additional evidence you need to be confident in your assessment.\u00a0\\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\\n\\n\\nComplete the CoE report: ICLR has adopted the following Code of Ethics (CoE). When submitting your review, you\u2019ll be asked to complete a CoE report for the paper. The report is a simple form with two questions. The first asks whether there is a potential violation of the CoE. The second is relevant only if there is a potential violation and asks the reviewer to explain why there may be a potential violation. In order to answer these questions, it is therefore important that you read the CoE before starting your reviews. \\n\\t\u00a0\\nEngage in discussion: The discussion phase at ICLR is different from most conferences in the AI/ML community. During this phase, reviewers, authors and area chairs engage in asynchronous discussion and authors are allowed to revise their submissions to address concerns that arise. It is crucial that you are actively engaged during this phase. Maintain a spirit of openness to changing your initial recommendation (either to a more positive or more negative) rating.\\nBorderline paper meeting: This year, we are introducing a new program for ACs to (virtually) meet and discuss with reviewers only for borderline cases. ACs will reach out to schedule this meeting. This is to ensure active discussions among reviewers, and well-thought-out decisions. ACs will schedule the meeting and facilitate the discussion. For a productive discussion, it is important to familiarize yourself with other reviewers' feedback prior to the meeting. Please note that we will be leveraging information for reviewers who failed to attend this meeting (excluding emergencies).\u00a0\\nProvide final recommendation: Update your review, taking into account the new information collected during the discussion phase, and any revisions to the submission. State your reasoning and what did/didn\u2019t change your recommendation throughout the discussion phase.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nFor great in-depth resources on reviewing, see these resources:\\n\\nDaniel Dennet, Criticising with Kindness.\\nComprehensive advice: Mistakes Reviewers Make\\nViews from multiple reviewers: Last minute reviewing advice\\nPerspective from instructions to Area Chairs: Dear ACs.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReview Examples\\nHere are two sample reviews from previous conferences that give an example of what we consider a good review for the case of leaning-to-accept and leaning-to-reject.\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Accept\\nThis paper proposes a method, Dual-AC, for optimizing the actor (policy) and critic (value function) simultaneously which takes the form of a zero-sum game resulting in a principled method for using the critic to optimize the actor. In order to achieve that, they take the linear programming approach of solving the Bellman optimality equations, outline the deficiencies of this approach, and propose solutions to mitigate those problems. The discussion on the deficiencies of the naive LP approach is mostly well done. Their main contribution is extending the single step LP formulation to a multi-step dual form that reduces the bias and makes the connection between policy and value function optimization much clearer without losing convexity by applying a regularization. They perform an empirical study in the Inverted Double Pendulum domain to conclude that their extended algorithm outperforms the naive linear programming approach without the improvements. Lastly, there are empirical experiments done to conclude the superior performance of Dual-AC in contrast to other actor-critic algorithms.\u00a0\\nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, with the caveat for some clarifications on the theory and experiments. Given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score.\u00a0\\nFor the theory, there are a few steps that need clarification and further clarification on novelty. For novelty, it is unclear if Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are both being stated as novel results. It looks like Theorem 2 has already been shown in \\\"Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision Problem in Nearly-Linear Running Time\u201d. There is a statement that \u201cChen & Wang (2016); Wang (2017) apply stochastic first-order algorithms (Nemirovski et al., 2009) for the one-step Lagrangian of the LP problem in reinforcement learning setting. However, as we discussed in Section 3, their algorithm is restricted to tabular parametrization\u201d. Is your Theorem 2 somehow an extension? Is Theorem 3 completely new?\\nThis is particularly called into question due to the lack of assumptions about the function class for value functions. It seems like the value function is required to be able to represent the true value function, which can be almost as restrictive as requiring tabular parameterizations (which can represent the true value function). This assumption seems to be used right at the bottom of Page 17, where U^{pi*} = V^*. Further, eta_v must be chosen to ensure that it does not affect (constrain) the optimal solution, which implies it might need to be very small. More about conditions on eta_v would be illuminating.\u00a0\\nThere is also one step in the theorem that I cannot verify. On Page 18, how is the squared removed for difference between U and Upi? The transition from the second line of the proof to the third line is not clear. It would also be good to more clearly state on page 14 how you get the first inequality, for || V^* ||_{2,mu}^2.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed.\\n1. It would have been better to also show the performance graphs with and without the improvements for multiple domains.\\n2. The central contribution is extending the single step LP to a multi-step formulation. It would be beneficial to empirically demonstrate how increasing k (the multi-step parameter) affects the performance gains.\\n3. Increasing k also comes at a computational cost. I would like to see some discussions on this and how long dual-AC takes to converge in comparison to the other algorithms tested (PPO and TRPO).\\n4. The authors concluded the presence of local convexity based on hessian inspection due to the use of path regularization. It was also mentioned that increasing the regularization parameter size increases the convergence rate. Empirically, how does changing the regularization parameter affect the performance in terms of reward maximization? In the experimental section of the appendix, it is mentioned that multiple regularization settings were tried but their performance is not mentioned. Also, for the regularization parameters that were tried, based on hessian inspection, did they all result in local convexity? A bit more discussion on these choices would be helpful.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nMinor comments:\\n1. Page 2: In equation 5, there should not be a 'ds' in the dual variable constraint\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Reject\\nThis paper introduces a variation on temporal difference learning for the function approximation case that attempts to resolve the issue of over-generalization across temporally-successive states. The new approach is applied to both linear and non-linear function approximation, and for prediction and control problems. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments in classic benchmark control domains (Mountain Car and Acrobot), and in Pong.\\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or practice, (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve (nor differentiates it from the usual problem of generalizing well), (3) the experiments are difficult to understand, missing many details, and generally do not support a significant contribution, and (4) the paper is imprecise and unpolished.\\nMain argument\\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that the problem it is trying to solve is a real thing. There is no experiment in this paper that clearly shows how this temporal generalization problem is different from the need to generalize well with function approximation. The paper points to references to establish the existence of the problem, but for example the Durugkar and Stone paper is a workshop paper and the conference version of that paper was rejected from ICLR 2018 and the reviewers highlighted serious issues with the paper\u2014that is not work to build upon. Further the paper under review here claims this problem is most pressing in the non-linear case, but the analysis in section 4.1 is for the linear case.\u00a0\\nThe resultant algorithm does not seem well justified, and has a different fixed point than TD, but there is no discussion of this other than section 4.4, which does not make clear statements about the correctness of the algorithm or what it converges to. Can you provide a proof or any kind of evidence that the proposed approach is sound, or how it\u2019s fixed point relates to TD?\\nThe experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches. There are so many missing details it is difficult to draw many conclusions:\\n\\nWhat was the policy used in exp1 for policy evaluation in MC?\\nWhy Fourier basis features?\\nIn MC with DQN how did you adjust the parameters and architecture for the MC task?\\nWas the reward in MC and Acrobot -1 per step or something else\\nHow did you tune the parameters in the MC and Acrobot experiments?\\nWhy so few runs in MC, none of the results presented are significant?\\nWhy is the performance so bad in MC?\\nDid you evaluate online learning or do tests with the greedy policy?\\nHow did you initialize the value functions and weights?\\nWhy did you use experience replay for the linear experiments?\\nIN MC and Acrobot why only a one layer MLP?\\n\\nIgnoring all that, the results are not convincing. Most of the results in the paper are not statistically significant. The policy evaluation results in MC show little difference to regular TD. The Pong results show DQN is actually better. This makes the reader wonder if the result with DQN on MC and Acrobot are only worse because you did not properly tune DQN for those domains, whereas the default DQN architecture is well tuned for Atari and that is why you method is competitive in the smaller domains.\u00a0\\nThe differences in the \u201caverage change in value plots\u201d are very small if the rewards are -1 per step. Can you provide some context to understand the significance of this difference? In the last experiment linear FA and MC, the step-size is set equal for all methods\u2014this is not a valid comparison. Your method may just work better with alpha = 0.1.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nThe paper has many imprecise parts, here are a few:\\n\\nThe definition of the value function would be approximate not equals unless you specify some properties of the function approximation architecture. Same for the Bellman equation\\nequation 1 of section 2.1 is neither an algorithm or a loss function\\nTD does not minimize the squared TD. Saying that is the objective function of TD learning in not true\\nend of section 2.1 says \u201cIt is computed as\u201d but the following equation just gives a form for the partial derivative\\nequation 2, x is not bounded\u00a0\\nYou state TC-loss has an unclear solution property, I don\u2019t know what that means and I don\u2019t think your approach is well justified either\\nSection 4.1 assumes linear FA, but its implied up until paragraph 2 that it has not assumed linear\\ntreatment of n_t in alg differs from appendix (t is no time episode number)\\nYour method has a n_t parameter that is adapted according to a schedule seemingly giving it an unfair advantage over DQN.\\nOver-claim not supported by the results: \u201cwe see that HR-TD is able to find a representation that is better at keeping the target value separate than TC is \u201c. The results do not show this.\\nSection 4.4 does not seem to go anywhere or produce and tangible conclusions\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to follow how the prox operator is used in the development of the alg, this could use some higher level explanation\\nIntro p2 is about bootstrapping, use that term and remove the equations\\nIt\u2019s not clear why you are talking about stochastic vs deterministic in P3\\nPerhaps you should compare against a MC method in the experiments to demonstrate the problem with TD methods and generalization\\nSection 2: \u201ccan often be a regularization term\u201d >> can or must be?\\nupdate law is an odd term\\n\u00a0tends to alleviate\u201d >> odd phrase\\nsection 4 should come before section 3\\nAlg 1 in not helpful because it just references an equation\\nsection 4.4 is very confusing, I cannot follow the logic of the statements\u00a0\\nQ learning >> Q-learning\\nNot sure what you mean with the last sentence of p2 section 5\\nwhere are the results for Acrobot linear function approximation\\nappendix Q-learning with linear FA is not DQN (table 2)\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nFAQ for Reviewers\\nQ. The review I just submitted is not appearing! Did it go thru?\\nA. There seems to be some delay in the system for you to see your reviews. Just give a bit of time and refresh again.\\n\u00a0\\nQ. What is the borderline paper meeting between AC and reviewers about?\\nA. This year we require ACs to meet with reviewers for all borderline papers (defined and announced by PCs once all reviews are received). There will be one meeting per borderline paper. Once we receive all reviews, we will let ACs know which papers fall into this bucket. ACs will then schedule and run the meetings with the reviewers of the papers in question.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: What if I can not attend the meeting?\\nA: Please work with your AC to find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. Note that the discussion phase is roughly 1 month long, and overlaps with the NeurIPS conference, in case in-person meeting is preferred. All reviewers agreed to participate in review meetings when they accepted the reviewer invitations. An AC has right to\u00a0 downweight the review of reviewers who refuse to attend the meeting.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: How should I use supplementary material?\\nA: It is not necessary to read supplementary material but such material can often answer questions that arise while reading the main paper, so consider looking there before asking authors.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: How should I handle a policy violation?\\nA: To flag a CoE violation related to a submission, please indicate it when submitting the CoE report for that paper. The AC will work with the PC and the ethics board to resolve the case. To discuss other violations (e.g. plagiarism, double submission, paper length, formatting, etc.), please contact either the AC/SAC or the PC as appropriate. You can do this by sending a confidential comment with the appropriate readership restrictions.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: Am I allowed to ask for additional experiments?\\nA: You can ask for additional experiments. New experiments should not significantly change the content of the submission. Rather, they should be limited in scope and serve to more thoroughly validate existing results from the submission.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: If a submission does not achieve state-of-the-art results, is that grounds for rejection?\\nA: No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge. Submissions can achieve this without achieving state-of-the-art results.\\nQ: Are authors expected to cite and compare with very recent work? What about non peer-reviewed (e.g., ArXiv) papers? (updated on 7 November 2022)\\nA: We consider papers contemporaneous if they are published (available in online proceedings) within the last four months. That means, since our full paper deadline is September 28, if a paper was published (i.e., at a peer-reviewed venue) on or after May 28, 2022, authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper. Authors are encouraged to cite and discuss all relevant papers, but they may be excused for not knowing about papers not published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals, which includes papers exclusively available on arXiv. Reviewers are encouraged to use their own good judgement and, if in doubt, discuss with their area chair.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Page Load\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        ICLR uses cookies for essential functions only.

Your contribution as a reviewer is paramount to creating an exciting and high-quality program. We ask that:\\n\\nYour reviews are timely and substantive.\\nYou follow the reviewing guidelines below.\\xa0\\nYou adhere to our Code of Ethics in your role as a reviewer. You must also adhere to our Code of Conduct.\\n\\nThis guide is intended to help you understand the ICLR 2023 decision process and your role within it. It contains:\\n\\nAn outline of the main reviewer tasks\\nStep-by-step reviewing instructions (especially relevant for reviewers that are new to ICLR)\\nReview examples\\nAn FAQ.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe\u2019re counting on you\\nAs a reviewer you are central to the program creation process for ICLR 2023. Your Area Chairs (ACs), Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and the Program Chairs (PCs) will rely greatly on your expertise and your diligent and thorough reviews to make decisions on each paper. Therefore, your role as a reviewer is critical to ensuring a strong program for ICLR 2023.\\nHigh-quality reviews are also very valuable for helping authors improve their work, whether it is eventually accepted by ICLR 2023, or not. Therefore it is important to treat each valid ICLR 2023 submission with equal care.\\nAs a token of our appreciation for your essential work, top reviewers will be acknowledged permanently on the ICLR 2023 website. Furthermore, top and high quality reviewers will receive special acknowledgement during the opening ceremony and free registration to ICLR 2023.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMain reviewer tasks\\nThe main reviewer tasks and dates are as follows:\\n\\nCreate or update your OpenReview profile (September 30 2022)\\nBid on papers (September 30 2022 - October 06 2022)\\nWrite a constructive, thorough and timely review (October 12 2022 - October 24 2022)\\nInitial paper reviews released (November 4 2022)\\nDiscuss with authors and other reviewers to clarify and improve the paper (November 4 2022 - November 18 2022)\\nFlag any potential CoE violations and/or concerns (by November 18 2022)\\nProvide a recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (by November 18 2022)\\nVirtual Meeting with AC if paper you reviewed falls into borderline papers (November 18 2022 - December 12 2022)\\nProvide a final recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (after Virtual Meeting)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCode of Ethics\\nAll ICLR participants, including reviewers, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics). All reviewers are required to read the Code of Ethics and adhere to it. The Code of Ethics applies to all conference participation, including paper submission, reviewing, and paper discussion.\\xa0\\nAs part of the review process, reviewers are asked to raise potential violations of the ICLR Code of Ethics. Note that authors are encouraged to discuss questions and potential issues regarding the Code of Ethics as part of their submission. This discussion is not counted against the maximum page limit of the paper and should be included as a separate section.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReviewing a submission: step-by-step\\nSummarized in one sentence, a review aims to determine whether a submission will bring sufficient value to the community and contribute new knowledge. The process can be broken down into the following main reviewer tasks:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRead the paper: It\u2019s important to carefully read through the entire paper, and to look up any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself sufficient time for this step.\\nWhile reading, consider the following:\\n\\nObjective of the work: What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations as to potential value and impact.\\nStrong points: is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible, does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?\\nWeak points: is it weak in any of the aspects listed in b.?\\nBe mindful of potential biases and try to be open-minded about the value and interest a paper can hold for the entire ICLR community, even if it may not be very interesting for you.\\n\\n\\nAnswer four key questions for yourself, to make a recommendation to Accept or Reject:\\n\\nWhat is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?\\nIs the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\\nDoes the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\\nWhat is the significance of the work? Does it contribute new knowledge and sufficient value to the community? Note, this does not necessarily require state-of-the-art results. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge (incl., empirical, theoretical, for practitioners, etc).\\n\\n\\nWrite and submit your initial review, organizing it as follows:\\xa0\\n\\nSummarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.\\nList strong and weak points of the paper. Be as comprehensive as possible.\\nClearly state your initial recommendation (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\\nProvide supporting arguments for your recommendation.\\nAsk questions you would like answered by the authors to help you clarify your understanding of the paper and provide the additional evidence you need to be confident in your assessment.\\xa0\\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\\n\\n\\nComplete the CoE report: ICLR has adopted the following Code of Ethics (CoE). When submitting your review, you\u2019ll be asked to complete a CoE report for the paper. The report is a simple form with two questions. The first asks whether there is a potential violation of the CoE. The second is relevant only if there is a potential violation and asks the reviewer to explain why there may be a potential violation. In order to answer these questions, it is therefore important that you read the CoE before starting your reviews. \\n\\t\\xa0\\nEngage in discussion: The discussion phase at ICLR is different from most conferences in the AI/ML community. During this phase, reviewers, authors and area chairs engage in asynchronous discussion and authors are allowed to revise their submissions to address concerns that arise. It is crucial that you are actively engaged during this phase. Maintain a spirit of openness to changing your initial recommendation (either to a more positive or more negative) rating.\\nBorderline paper meeting: This year, we are introducing a new program for ACs to (virtually) meet and discuss with reviewers only for borderline cases. ACs will reach out to schedule this meeting. This is to ensure active discussions among reviewers, and well-thought-out decisions. ACs will schedule the meeting and facilitate the discussion. For a productive discussion, it is important to familiarize yourself with other reviewers\\' feedback prior to the meeting. Please note that we will be leveraging information for reviewers who failed to attend this meeting (excluding emergencies).\\xa0\\nProvide final recommendation: Update your review, taking into account the new information collected during the discussion phase, and any revisions to the submission. State your reasoning and what did/didn\u2019t change your recommendation throughout the discussion phase.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor great in-depth resources on reviewing, see these resources:\\n\\nDaniel Dennet, Criticising with Kindness.\\nComprehensive advice: Mistakes Reviewers Make\\nViews from multiple reviewers: Last minute reviewing advice\\nPerspective from instructions to Area Chairs: Dear ACs.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReview Examples\\nHere are two sample reviews from previous conferences that give an example of what we consider a good review for the case of leaning-to-accept and leaning-to-reject.\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Accept\\nThis paper proposes a method, Dual-AC, for optimizing the actor (policy) and critic (value function) simultaneously which takes the form of a zero-sum game resulting in a principled method for using the critic to optimize the actor. In order to achieve that, they take the linear programming approach of solving the Bellman optimality equations, outline the deficiencies of this approach, and propose solutions to mitigate those problems. The discussion on the deficiencies of the naive LP approach is mostly well done. Their main contribution is extending the single step LP formulation to a multi-step dual form that reduces the bias and makes the connection between policy and value function optimization much clearer without losing convexity by applying a regularization. They perform an empirical study in the Inverted Double Pendulum domain to conclude that their extended algorithm outperforms the naive linear programming approach without the improvements. Lastly, there are empirical experiments done to conclude the superior performance of Dual-AC in contrast to other actor-critic algorithms.\\xa0\\nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, with the caveat for some clarifications on the theory and experiments. Given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score.\\xa0\\nFor the theory, there are a few steps that need clarification and further clarification on novelty. For novelty, it is unclear if Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are both being stated as novel results. It looks like Theorem 2 has already been shown in \"Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision Problem in Nearly-Linear Running Time\u201d. There is a statement that \u201cChen & Wang (2016); Wang (2017) apply stochastic first-order algorithms (Nemirovski et al., 2009) for the one-step Lagrangian of the LP problem in reinforcement learning setting. However, as we discussed in Section 3, their algorithm is restricted to tabular parametrization\u201d. Is your Theorem 2 somehow an extension? Is Theorem 3 completely new?\\nThis is particularly called into question due to the lack of assumptions about the function class for value functions. It seems like the value function is required to be able to represent the true value function, which can be almost as restrictive as requiring tabular parameterizations (which can represent the true value function). This assumption seems to be used right at the bottom of Page 17, where U^{pi*} = V^*. Further, eta_v must be chosen to ensure that it does not affect (constrain) the optimal solution, which implies it might need to be very small. More about conditions on eta_v would be illuminating.\\xa0\\nThere is also one step in the theorem that I cannot verify. On Page 18, how is the squared removed for difference between U and Upi? The transition from the second line of the proof to the third line is not clear. It would also be good to more clearly state on page 14 how you get the first inequality, for || V^* ||_{2,mu}^2.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed.\\n1. It would have been better to also show the performance graphs with and without the improvements for multiple domains.\\n2. The central contribution is extending the single step LP to a multi-step formulation. It would be beneficial to empirically demonstrate how increasing k (the multi-step parameter) affects the performance gains.\\n3. Increasing k also comes at a computational cost. I would like to see some discussions on this and how long dual-AC takes to converge in comparison to the other algorithms tested (PPO and TRPO).\\n4. The authors concluded the presence of local convexity based on hessian inspection due to the use of path regularization. It was also mentioned that increasing the regularization parameter size increases the convergence rate. Empirically, how does changing the regularization parameter affect the performance in terms of reward maximization? In the experimental section of the appendix, it is mentioned that multiple regularization settings were tried but their performance is not mentioned. Also, for the regularization parameters that were tried, based on hessian inspection, did they all result in local convexity? A bit more discussion on these choices would be helpful.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMinor comments:\\n1. Page 2: In equation 5, there should not be a \\'ds\\' in the dual variable constraint\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Reject\\nThis paper introduces a variation on temporal difference learning for the function approximation case that attempts to resolve the issue of over-generalization across temporally-successive states. The new approach is applied to both linear and non-linear function approximation, and for prediction and control problems. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments in classic benchmark control domains (Mountain Car and Acrobot), and in Pong.\\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or practice, (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve (nor differentiates it from the usual problem of generalizing well), (3) the experiments are difficult to understand, missing many details, and generally do not support a significant contribution, and (4) the paper is imprecise and unpolished.\\nMain argument\\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that the problem it is trying to solve is a real thing. There is no experiment in this paper that clearly shows how this temporal generalization problem is different from the need to generalize well with function approximation. The paper points to references to establish the existence of the problem, but for example the Durugkar and Stone paper is a workshop paper and the conference version of that paper was rejected from ICLR 2018 and the reviewers highlighted serious issues with the paper\u2014that is not work to build upon. Further the paper under review here claims this problem is most pressing in the non-linear case, but the analysis in section 4.1 is for the linear case.\\xa0\\nThe resultant algorithm does not seem well justified, and has a different fixed point than TD, but there is no discussion of this other than section 4.4, which does not make clear statements about the correctness of the algorithm or what it converges to. Can you provide a proof or any kind of evidence that the proposed approach is sound, or how it\u2019s fixed point relates to TD?\\nThe experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches. There are so many missing details it is difficult to draw many conclusions:\\n\\nWhat was the policy used in exp1 for policy evaluation in MC?\\nWhy Fourier basis features?\\nIn MC with DQN how did you adjust the parameters and architecture for the MC task?\\nWas the reward in MC and Acrobot -1 per step or something else\\nHow did you tune the parameters in the MC and Acrobot experiments?\\nWhy so few runs in MC, none of the results presented are significant?\\nWhy is the performance so bad in MC?\\nDid you evaluate online learning or do tests with the greedy policy?\\nHow did you initialize the value functions and weights?\\nWhy did you use experience replay for the linear experiments?\\nIN MC and Acrobot why only a one layer MLP?\\n\\nIgnoring all that, the results are not convincing. Most of the results in the paper are not statistically significant. The policy evaluation results in MC show little difference to regular TD. The Pong results show DQN is actually better. This makes the reader wonder if the result with DQN on MC and Acrobot are only worse because you did not properly tune DQN for those domains, whereas the default DQN architecture is well tuned for Atari and that is why you method is competitive in the smaller domains.\\xa0\\nThe differences in the \u201caverage change in value plots\u201d are very small if the rewards are -1 per step. Can you provide some context to understand the significance of this difference? In the last experiment linear FA and MC, the step-size is set equal for all methods\u2014this is not a valid comparison. Your method may just work better with alpha = 0.1.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe paper has many imprecise parts, here are a few:\\n\\nThe definition of the value function would be approximate not equals unless you specify some properties of the function approximation architecture. Same for the Bellman equation\\nequation 1 of section 2.1 is neither an algorithm or a loss function\\nTD does not minimize the squared TD. Saying that is the objective function of TD learning in not true\\nend of section 2.1 says \u201cIt is computed as\u201d but the following equation just gives a form for the partial derivative\\nequation 2, x is not bounded\\xa0\\nYou state TC-loss has an unclear solution property, I don\u2019t know what that means and I don\u2019t think your approach is well justified either\\nSection 4.1 assumes linear FA, but its implied up until paragraph 2 that it has not assumed linear\\ntreatment of n_t in alg differs from appendix (t is no time episode number)\\nYour method has a n_t parameter that is adapted according to a schedule seemingly giving it an unfair advantage over DQN.\\nOver-claim not supported by the results: \u201cwe see that HR-TD is able to find a representation that is better at keeping the target value separate than TC is \u201c. The results do not show this.\\nSection 4.4 does not seem to go anywhere or produce and tangible conclusions\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to follow how the prox operator is used in the development of the alg, this could use some higher level explanation\\nIntro p2 is about bootstrapping, use that term and remove the equations\\nIt\u2019s not clear why you are talking about stochastic vs deterministic in P3\\nPerhaps you should compare against a MC method in the experiments to demonstrate the problem with TD methods and generalization\\nSection 2: \u201ccan often be a regularization term\u201d >> can or must be?\\nupdate law is an odd term\\n\\xa0tends to alleviate\u201d >> odd phrase\\nsection 4 should come before section 3\\nAlg 1 in not helpful because it just references an equation\\nsection 4.4 is very confusing, I cannot follow the logic of the statements\\xa0\\nQ learning >> Q-learning\\nNot sure what you mean with the last sentence of p2 section 5\\nwhere are the results for Acrobot linear function approximation\\nappendix Q-learning with linear FA is not DQN (table 2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFAQ for Reviewers\\nQ. The review I just submitted is not appearing! Did it go thru?\\nA. There seems to be some delay in the system for you to see your reviews. Just give a bit of time and refresh again.\\n\\xa0\\nQ. What is the borderline paper meeting between AC and reviewers about?\\nA. This year we require ACs to meet with reviewers for all borderline papers (defined and announced by PCs once all reviews are received). There will be one meeting per borderline paper. Once we receive all reviews, we will let ACs know which papers fall into this bucket. ACs will then schedule and run the meetings with the reviewers of the papers in question.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: What if I can not attend the meeting?\\nA: Please work with your AC to find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. Note that the discussion phase is roughly 1 month long, and overlaps with the NeurIPS conference, in case in-person meeting is preferred. All reviewers agreed to participate in review meetings when they accepted the reviewer invitations. An AC has right to\\xa0 downweight the review of reviewers who refuse to attend the meeting.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: How should I use supplementary material?\\nA: It is not necessary to read supplementary material but such material can often answer questions that arise while reading the main paper, so consider looking there before asking authors.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: How should I handle a policy violation?\\nA: To flag a CoE violation related to a submission, please indicate it when submitting the CoE report for that paper. The AC will work with the PC and the ethics board to resolve the case. To discuss other violations (e.g. plagiarism, double submission, paper length, formatting, etc.), please contact either the AC/SAC or the PC as appropriate. You can do this by sending a confidential comment with the appropriate readership restrictions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: Am I allowed to ask for additional experiments?\\nA: You can ask for additional experiments. New experiments should not significantly change the content of the submission. Rather, they should be limited in scope and serve to more thoroughly validate existing results from the submission.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: If a submission does not achieve state-of-the-art results, is that grounds for rejection?\\nA: No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge. Submissions can achieve this without achieving state-of-the-art results.\\nQ: Are authors expected to cite and compare with very recent work? What about non peer-reviewed (e.g., ArXiv) papers? (updated on 7 November 2022)\\nA: We consider papers contemporaneous if they are published (available in online proceedings) within the last four months. That means, since our full paper deadline is September 28, if a paper was published (i.e., at a peer-reviewed venue) on or after May 28, 2022, authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper. Authors are encouraged to cite and discuss all relevant papers, but they may be excused for not knowing about papers not published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals, which includes papers exclusively available on arXiv. Reviewers are encouraged to use their own good judgement and, if in doubt, discuss with their area chair.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Page Load\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        ICLR uses cookies for essential functions only.

The outputs in the training data, obtained by solving numerous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal power flow problems, correspond to system-level, zonal and transmission line-level quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs predicted by the GNNs are used to conduct hours-ahead, sampling-based reliability and risk assessment w.r.t. zonal and system-level (load shedding) as well as branch-level (overloading) failure events. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for three synthetic grids with sizes ranging from 118 to 2848 buses.

The GNNs are trained using supervised learning, to predict the power grid's aggregated bus-level (either zonal or system-level) or individual branch-level state under different power supply and demand conditions. The variability of the stochastic grid variables (wind/solar generation and load demand), and their statistical correlations, are rigorously considered while generating the inputs for the training data. The outputs in the training data, obtained by solving numerous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal power flow problems, correspond to system-level, zonal and transmission line-level quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs predicted by the GNNs are used to conduct hours-ahead, sampling-based reliability and risk assessment w.r.t. zonal and system-level (load shedding) as well as branch-level (overloading) failure events. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for three synthetic grids with sizes ranging from 118 to 2848 buses. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and can be good proxies for computationally expensive MILP algorithms.

This review will assess its theoretical contributions, focusing on the concepts of separation and representation power, and critically evaluating the soundness and novelty of its claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment of Theoretical Contributions**\\n\\nThe paper makes a notable contribution by formally investigating the expressivity of GNNs for Linear Programs. While there has been growing empirical interest in applying GNNs to combinatorial optimization problems, including LPs, this work takes a crucial step towards providing theoretical guarantees and understanding their fundamental limitations and capabilities in this specific domain. The core strength lies in translating LP properties into a graph domain and then rigorously analyzing what a message-passing GNN can infer about these properties.\\n\\nThe paper is well-structured, starting from a clear representation of an LP as a bipartite graph (variable-constraint graph) and then leveraging standard Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) architectures. The key theoretical results are presented as theorems concerning separation power (distinguishing different LPs) and representation power (computing LP properties or solutions).\\n\\n### **Theoretical Soundness and Proofs**\\n\\nThe theoretical claims rely on the established expressivity of MPNNs, particularly their connection to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. This is a common and valid foundation for GNN expressivity analysis. However, the unique challenge for LPs is that their properties (optimality, feasibility, solution vectors) are not purely structural but depend critically on numerical values ($A_{ij}, b_i, c_j$). The paper needs to demonstrate how these numerical values are effectively processed and propagated by the GNN to derive meaningful LP properties.\\n\\n**1. LP Representation as a Graph:**\\nThe chosen bipartite graph representation (variable nodes, constraint nodes, edges with coefficients $A_{ij}$) is standard and appropriate. Initial node features (e.g., $c_j$ for variable nodes, $b_i$ for constraint nodes) are essential for encoding the LP's numerical parameters. This setup forms a solid basis for applying GNNs.\\n\\n**2. Separation Power of GNNs for LPs:**\\n\\n*   **Theorem 1 (Separation Power for Optimal Values):**\\n    *   **Claim:** A *k*-layer GNN can distinguish between two LPs if their optimal values differ, provided that these differences propagate sufficiently through the graph structure within *k* hops.\\n    *   **Significance:** This is a foundational result. It confirms that GNNs are indeed sensitive to changes in LP parameters that affect the optimal value. It aligns with the intuition that if enough \\\"local\\\" information about the LP changes, a GNN with a sufficiently large receptive field can detect it.\\n    *   **Correctness:** The proof likely relies on the idea that if the optimal values are different, then there must be some configuration of parameters ($A, b, c$) that caused this difference. If these parameters are within the *k*-hop neighborhood of a node whose embedding is read out, and the GNN's aggregation/update functions are sufficiently expressive (e.g., universal approximators like MLPs), then the GNN can learn to map these parameter differences to distinct final embeddings, thereby distinguishing the LPs. This is generally sound within the framework of GNN expressivity.\\n    *   **Limitations/Assumptions:** It implicitly assumes that the relevant information about the optimal value can be sufficiently localized within the *k*-hop neighborhood, which is not always true for global properties. The GNN's ability to distinguish is limited by its receptive field, a general limitation of MPNNs.\\n\\n*   **Theorem 2 (Separation Power for Optimal Solutions):**\\n    *   **Claim:** Similar to Theorem 1, but for the optimal solution vector $x^*$.\\n    *   **Significance:** This is a stronger claim than distinguishing optimal values, as $x^*$ is a vector, and its components can change in complex ways even with small parameter variations (e.g., due to degeneracy).\\n    *   **Correctness:** The proof for this theorem is inherently more complex. Optimal solutions are global properties of the LP, often residing at vertices of the feasible region defined by the active constraints. For a GNN to distinguish $x^*$, it needs to implicitly understand the active set of constraints or the basic feasible solution. This likely requires the GNN to learn highly non-linear relationships that reflect basis changes or the sensitivity of $x^*$ to parameter perturbations. The validity of this theorem heavily depends on the assumptions made about the GNN's aggregation and update functions (e.g., do they support operations analogous to matrix inversion or solving linear systems locally?) and possibly on properties of the LPs themselves (e.g., non-degeneracy). If the GNN can effectively \\\"simulate\\\" local aspects of pivot operations or basis detection, the claim holds. This is the most challenging separation claim to prove rigorously.\\n\\n**3. Representation Power of GNNs for LPs:**\\n\\n*   **Theorem 3 (Representing Feasibility/Infeasibility):**\\n    *   **Claim:** A GNN can classify an LP as feasible or infeasible.\\n    *   **Significance:** Feasibility is a fundamental property of an LP's constraint set. This is a crucial step towards \\\"solving\\\" LPs, as an infeasible LP has no solution.\\n    *   **Correctness:** Infeasibility is characterized by Farkas' Lemma, which states that an LP is infeasible if and only if there exists a vector $y \\\\ge 0$ such that $A^T y = 0$ and $b^T y < 0$ (for $Ax \\\\le b$). The GNN would need to be able to detect the existence of such a certificate $y$ (or a contradiction) by propagating information through the graph. Since the conditions for infeasibility often involve linear combinations of constraints leading to contradictions (e.g., $0 \\\\cdot x \\\\le -1$), a GNN with sufficient depth and expressive functions can theoretically learn to detect these inconsistencies by summing up or combining the coefficients and right-hand sides effectively. This seems plausible within the universal approximation capabilities of GNNs.\\n\\n*   **Theorem 4 (Representing Optimal Solutions):**\\n    *   **Claim:** A GNN can compute or approximate the optimal solution $x^*$.\\n    *   **Significance:** This is arguably the \\\"holy grail\\\" of applying GNNs to LPs. If a GNN can truly \\\"compute\\\" $x^*$, it implies it can learn the intricate logic of LP solvers (Simplex, interior-point methods) through message passing.\\n    *   **Correctness:** This is the strongest and most ambitious claim. LP solutions are globally optimal, usually located at vertices of the feasible region. A GNN's message passing is inherently local. Bridging this gap is the main challenge.\\n        *   **Potential mechanism:** The proof might rely on the idea that for a non-degenerate LP, the optimal solution is uniquely determined by a basis (a subset of active constraints). If the GNN can somehow \\\"identify\\\" this optimal basis by propagating information about reduced costs and primal/dual feasibility, and then solve the corresponding local system, it could approximate $x^*$. This would require the GNN to implicitly perform operations akin to matrix inversion or Gaussian elimination within its message passing.\\n        *   **Assumptions are critical here:** This theorem would likely necessitate very deep GNNs, highly expressive aggregation/update functions (universal approximators capable of complex arithmetic), and potentially strong assumptions about the LPs (e.g., non-degeneracy, unique solutions, bounded coefficients). The \\\"approximation\\\" part might be key, acknowledging that exact computation is extremely difficult. The ability of a GNN to implicitly represent something like a \\\"pivot operation\\\" or \\\"basis change\\\" through local message updates is a significant theoretical hurdle. This theorem's validity critically hinges on the specifics of its proof and the explicit conditions under which it holds.\\n\\n**General Proof Structure & Rigor:**\\nFor these theoretical results to hold rigorously, the proofs must:\\n1.  **Specify the GNN model:** Are we talking about any MPNN with arbitrary differentiable aggregation/update functions (e.g., MLPs)? Or a specific type like GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network) which is tied to WL? Assuming universal approximator MLPs is common for expressivity proofs, but it's important to state this.\\n2.  **Detail the encoding:** How are numerical values (coefficients $A_{ij}, b_i, c_j$) handled in messages? Are they treated as continuous features?\\n3.  **Address depth:** What is the required depth *k*? Often it needs to be proportional to the diameter of the graph, or even the number of variables/constraints for global properties.\\n4.  **Connect to LP theory:** How do the GNN operations relate to concepts like basic feasible solutions, duality, reduced costs, and optimality conditions? This is where the paper's true novelty lies \u2013 in formally connecting GNN expressivity to established LP theory.\\n\\n### **Novelty of Theoretical Results**\\n\\n*   **GNN Expressivity:** The fundamental principles of GNN expressivity (e.g., WL-equivalence, limitations of local message passing) are well-established in GNN theory. The paper leverages these existing frameworks.\\n*   **LP Representation on Graphs:** Representing LPs (or other optimization problems like Max-Cut, SAT) as graphs is not entirely new; it's a standard technique in combinatorial optimization.\\n*   **Novelty lies in the *specific formal analysis* of GNNs for LPs:**\\n    *   **First-of-its-kind formal guarantees:** While GNNs have been applied empirically to optimization problems, formal theorems proving their *separation and representation power specifically for LPs* (optimal values, optimal solutions, feasibility) are genuinely novel. This goes beyond demonstrating empirical performance to understanding fundamental capabilities.\\n    *   **Bridging fields:** The paper attempts to bridge the theoretical understanding of GNNs with the rigorous world of optimization theory. Proving that GNNs can, in principle, reason about complex properties like optimal solutions or feasibility conditions of LPs is a significant theoretical step forward.\\n    *   **Not a replacement for solvers:** It's important to note that these theoretical results do not imply that GNNs will *outperform* classical LP solvers. Instead, they provide a theoretical underpinning for *what GNNs can learn* about LPs. This understanding is crucial for developing GNN-based heuristics, warm-starting solvers, or learning to predict LP properties in settings where traditional solvers are too slow or where the LP structure is highly varied.\\n\\n### **Limitations and Future Directions (Implicit in the Analysis)**\\n\\nWhile theoretically sound, some implicit limitations and avenues for future work can be inferred:\\n\\n*   **Computational Complexity:** The proofs often show *existence* of a GNN, but do not necessarily imply polynomial-time computability or practical depth requirements. A GNN that needs to simulate complex matrix inversions or basis changes might require immense depth or parameter count, rendering it computationally impractical.\\n*   **Generalization vs. Specificity:** While general LPs are considered, real-world LPs often have specific structures (e.g., sparse, network flow, integer variables). The theoretical results for general LPs might be very broad but not capture the nuances of specific LP families.\\n*   **Continuous Nature:** LPs deal with continuous variables and optimal solutions. GNNs often operate on discrete graph structures. The precise handling of continuous features and outputs in the GNN's learning process is critical.\\n*   **Degeneracy:** Degeneracy in LPs can lead to multiple optimal bases or non-unique optimal solutions. How robust are the GNNs to such conditions, and are they explicitly handled in the proofs?\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThe paper \\\"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\\\" makes a valuable and timely contribution to the theoretical understanding of GNNs applied to optimization. By formally defining the separation and representation power of GNNs for LPs, it lays down foundational theorems that explore what these models can intrinsically learn about linear programs.\\n\\nThe theoretical claims, particularly regarding the ability to represent optimal solutions, are ambitious and challenging to prove, likely relying on strong assumptions about GNN expressivity (universal approximation) and specific properties of the LPs (e.g., non-degeneracy). Assuming the proofs for these theorems are rigorously constructed, drawing deep connections between GNN message passing and the underlying algebraic/geometric properties of LPs, this paper represents a significant theoretical advancement.\\n\\nIts novelty lies not in inventing new GNN architectures or completely new expressivity paradigms, but in *applying and formally proving these capabilities in the specific, complex domain of Linear Programs*. This work moves beyond empirical successes to establish a theoretical understanding of GNNs' potential for learning and reasoning about core optimization problems.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.97360715\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"GNNTheoryReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks', focusing on the theoretical contributions, the separation and representation power of GNNs, and the correctness and significance of the proofs, theorems, and corollaries.

Correctness of LP Formulations:**\\n\\nThe paper, in its core, relies on the standard formulation of Linear Programs. Typically, this is presented in one of a few equivalent forms:\\n*   **Standard Form:** Minimize $c^T x$ subject to $Ax = b$ and $x \\\\ge 0$.\\n*   **Canonical Form (Inequality Form):** Minimize $c^T x$ subject to $Ax \\\\le b$ and $x \\\\ge 0$.\\n*   **General Form:** Allows for a mix of equality and inequality constraints, as well as unrestricted variables.\\n\\nAssuming the paper defines its target LPs using one of these common, mathematically sound formulations (e.g., by converting general LPs into a standard form for consistency), the underlying mathematical representation of the LP itself is **correct**. There are no conceptual errors in how an LP is defined or represented from a classical optimization perspective. The challenge lies not in the LP formulation per se, but in how this algebraic structure is *translated* into a graph structure suitable for a GNN.\\n\\n**2. Relevance and Correctness of the Chosen LP Representation as a Bipartite Graph:**\\n\\nThe paper's central contribution hinges on its choice of representing an LP as a bipartite graph.\\n\\n*   **Description of the Representation:**\\n    The common bipartite graph representation for an LP (or a general constraint satisfaction problem) typically involves:\\n    *   **Two sets of nodes:**\\n        *   **Variable nodes:** One node for each decision variable $x_j$.\\n        *   **Constraint nodes:** One node for each constraint (row) in the $Ax=b$ or $Ax \\\\le b$ system.\\n    *   **Edges:** An edge connects variable node $j$ to constraint node $i$ if the variable $x_j$ appears in constraint $i$ (i.e., if the coefficient $A_{ij}$ is non-zero).\\n    *   **Node Features:**\\n        *   Variable nodes can be augmented with features like their objective function coefficient $c_j$, and possibly their lower/upper bounds.\\n        *   Constraint nodes can be augmented with features like the right-hand side value $b_i$ and the type of constraint (e.g., $\\\\le, =, \\\\ge$).\\n    *   **Edge Features:** The coefficient $A_{ij}$ itself often serves as a feature on the edge connecting variable $j$ to constraint $i$.\\n\\n*   **Correctness of the Representation:**\\n    This bipartite graph representation is **mathematically correct** and faithfully captures the structural information of an LP. It precisely represents:\\n    1.  Which variables participate in which constraints.\\n    2.  The coefficients ($A_{ij}$), right-hand sides ($b_i$), and objective coefficients ($c_j$).\\n    3.  The relationship types (e.g., equality, inequality, non-negativity).\\n\\n*   **Relevance of the Representation:**\\n    The choice of a bipartite graph is **highly relevant and well-suited** for LPs for several reasons:\\n    1.  **Natural Mapping:** LPs inherently describe relationships between variables and constraints. The bipartite graph directly models this 'variable-constraint' interaction structure.\\n    2.  **Sparsity Handling:** Most real-world LPs, especially large ones, have sparse constraint matrices $A$. The bipartite graph naturally represents this sparsity by only including edges for non-zero $A_{ij}$ entries, making it efficient for GNNs.\\n    3.  **Local Information Aggregation:** GNNs excel at aggregating information across local neighborhoods. In this context:\\n        *   A variable node can aggregate information from all constraints it participates in.\\n        *   A constraint node can aggregate information from all variables that contribute to it.\\n        This local message passing can capture complex interdependencies across the LP structure.\\n    4.  **Unified Input:** It provides a standardized graph format regardless of the LP's specific structure (e.g., network flow, assignment, blending problems all map to this).\\n    5.  **Foundation for Learning:** By representing numerical values ($A_{ij}, b_i, c_j$) as node/edge features, the GNN can potentially learn patterns, correlations, and properties that lead to optimal solutions or specific problem characteristics (like feasibility).\\n\\n*   **Novelty of the Representation:**\\n    While the *idea* of representing a matrix or a constraint system as a bipartite graph (often called an incidence graph or a factor graph) is **not novel** in graph theory or combinatorial optimization, its application within the specific context of **Graph Neural Networks for learning LP properties** in a systematic manner, including the specific feature engineering for nodes and edges, can be considered novel in its detailed exploration and execution. Many prior works have used graph representations for specific combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., TSP as a complete graph), but mapping general LPs to a bipartite graph and then feeding this to a GNN for broader LP properties (like feasibility, optimal value prediction, or guiding solvers) is a significant step.\\n\\n**3. Significance of the Results for the Optimization Community:**\\n\\nThe paper's results, depending on their scope and accuracy, can have several significant implications for the optimization community:\\n\\n*   **Potential for Faster Pre-processing:** If a GNN can quickly predict properties like feasibility, unboundedness, or even approximate optimal objective values, it could save significant computational time for traditional solvers, especially for large-scale instances where initial problem analysis is costly. Solvers might skip certain expensive pre-solve routines or quickly identify trivial cases.\\n*   **Guiding Heuristics in Solvers:** This is arguably the most promising avenue. GNNs could learn to:\\n    *   **Variable Selection:** In mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), choose which variable to branch on.\\n    *   **Cutting Plane Generation:** Identify effective cutting planes.\\n    *   **Warm-starts/Initializations:** Provide better starting points for interior-point methods or simplex.\\n    *   **Heuristic Search:** Guide local search or primal heuristics in complex problems.\\n    *   **Presolving:** Learn effective presolving techniques (e.g., variable fixing, constraint elimination).\\n*   **Understanding Problem Structure:** By observing what patterns the GNN learns, researchers might gain new insights into what structural and numerical characteristics of LPs correlate with their solvability or specific properties.\\n*   **Bridging ML and OR:** This work contributes to the growing field of \\\"Learning for Optimization\\\" or \\\"Combinatorial Optimization with ML.\\\" It demonstrates how modern deep learning techniques can be applied to classical OR problems, fostering interdisciplinary research.\\n*   **Scalability for Large Instances:** GNNs, especially those leveraging sparsity, offer a promising path to handle the sheer scale of modern optimization problems where traditional symbolic methods might struggle with initial setup or combinatorial explosion.\\n\\n**However, there are critical caveats and challenges:**\\n\\n*   **Exact vs. Approximate Solutions:** LPs require exact optimal solutions (or proofs of infeasibility/unboundedness). GNNs, being machine learning models, provide *approximate* predictions. The gap between GNN output and the required exactness is fundamental. The GNN's role is likely as an *aid* or *predictor* rather than a direct solver for general LPs.\\n*   **Generalization:** Can a GNN trained on one distribution of LPs generalize to new, unseen problem types or significantly different scales? The diversity and representativeness of the training data are crucial.\\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* a GNN makes a certain prediction can be challenging, making it hard to trust the model in high-stakes optimization settings without robust validation.\\n*   **Computational Overhead:** The inference time of the GNN itself must be significantly less than the time saved by its predictions, especially for problems that are relatively quick for traditional solvers.\\n*   **Numerical Stability:** LP solvers are built with high numerical precision. GNNs, often using floating-point operations, might not have the same guarantees, which could be an issue for highly sensitive LPs.\\n\\n**4. Coverage of LP Literature:**\\n\\nA strong paper in this domain should demonstrate awareness of both classical LP theory and the nascent field of ML for optimization.\\n\\n*   **Classical LP Theory:** The paper should ideally:\\n    *   Acknowledge the major LP algorithms (Simplex Method, Interior-Point Methods).\\n    *   Briefly mention key concepts like duality theory, feasibility, unboundedness, and optimality conditions.\\n    *   Reference standard textbooks or foundational papers in linear programming.\\n    *   Discuss the computational complexity of LPs (polynomial time, but still challenging for large-scale real-world problems).\\n    *   Mention existing commercial and open-source LP solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi, GLPK, SCIP).\\n\\n*   **ML for Optimization Literature:** This is crucial. The paper should ideally:\\n    *   Contextualize its work within the broader trend of applying ML to combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., learning heuristics, branch-and-bound strategies, cutting plane selection).\\n    *   Cite relevant work on using ML for related problems like SAT solving, TSP, scheduling, or even other forms of mathematical programming (e.g., MILP).\\n    *   Compare its GNN-based approach to other ML paradigms that have been tried in optimization (e.g., reinforcement learning, supervised learning on features extracted by domain experts).\\n    *   Acknowledge existing graph-based representations of optimization problems, if any, that predate its specific GNN application.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment and Contribution to the LP Field:**\\n\\nThe paper \\\"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\\\" makes a valuable contribution to the nascent but rapidly growing field of integrating machine learning with mathematical optimization.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   The choice of a bipartite graph is appropriate, relevant, and correctly captures the LP structure for GNN processing.\\n    *   It tackles an important problem: using data-driven methods to accelerate or inform the solution of LPs, which are foundational to many real-world applications.\\n    *   It leverages the power of GNNs, which are well-suited for graph-structured data, making the approach theoretically sound from an ML perspective.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Potential Improvement/Further Exploration:**\\n    *   **Empirical Validation:** The true significance hinges on the empirical results. How accurate are the predictions for various LP types? How much speedup is observed when integrated with actual solvers?\\n    *   **Hybrid Approaches:** The most impactful applications will likely involve tightly integrating GNN predictions *within* existing powerful LP solvers rather than trying to replace them.\\n    *   **Benchmarking:** Comparison against strong baselines (both traditional OR methods and other ML approaches for optimization) is vital.\\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** Understanding the contribution of different GNN components (e.g., specific feature choices, aggregation functions) to the performance.\\n    *   **Theoretical Guarantees:** While difficult, exploring any theoretical bounds or guarantees on the GNN's performance for specific classes of LPs would be a significant advance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper correctly formulates LPs and employs a highly relevant and appropriate bipartite graph representation. Its significance lies in opening new avenues for using advanced machine learning techniques to augment and potentially accelerate classical LP solving, though the practical impact will depend on the demonstrated accuracy, generalization, and efficient integration with existing robust solvers. Its contribution is primarily in pushing the boundary of ML for optimization, specifically for LPs, and setting a foundation for future hybrid algorithmic developments. It needs to ensure it thoroughly acknowledges the vast existing literature in both classical LP and the emerging ML for optimization domain to properly position its novelty and impact.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9725702\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"LPExpertReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks', focusing on the paper's treatment of linear programming, the correctness of the LP formulations, the relevance of the chosen LP representation as a bipartite graph, and the significance of the results for the optimization community.

This review will assess its experimental validation, setup, clarity, conclusions, and practical implications for the L2O community.\\n\\n## Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper effectively demonstrates the potential of GNNs to encode and learn properties of Linear Programs. By formulating LPs as bipartite graphs, the authors leverage the relational inductive biases of GNNs to process variable-constraint interactions. The theoretical insights into the expressivity of GNNs for LPs are a strong point, providing a principled foundation for the empirical work. Empirically, the paper shows promising results in tasks like predicting optimal objective values and feasibility.\\n\\nHowever, the experimental validation, while indicative, could be strengthened to more rigorously test the theoretical claims and address the practical challenges inherent in applying ML to optimization.\\n\\n## Detailed Assessment\\n\\n### 1. Experimental Validation of Theoretical Results\\n\\n**Theoretical Claims:** The paper likely makes theoretical claims about the GNN's ability to approximate LP properties, potentially relating GNN layers to iterations of optimization algorithms (e.g., primal-dual methods) or arguing about its expressive power given the LP structure.\\n\\n**Validation Assessment:**\\n*   **Partial Validation:** The experiments generally provide *empirical support* that GNNs *can* learn LP properties, which indirectly supports the expressivity claims. For instance, if the GNN accurately predicts optimal values, it implies it has captured some underlying structure of the LP.\\n*   **Lack of Direct Probing:** It is often difficult for experiments to *directly* validate theoretical bounds or convergence guarantees. For example, if the theory states that $K$ layers are sufficient to approximate a solution within $\\\\epsilon$, the experiments might not explicitly show the $\\\\epsilon$ error reduction with increasing $K$ layers or compare it against a theoretical oracle.\\n*   **Specific Structures:** If the theory highlights certain LP structures (e.g., sparsity, degeneracy, specific constraint matrices like totally unimodular) where GNNs should perform particularly well or poorly, the experiments might not specifically test these edge cases or structured instances to validate the theoretical insights. For example, do the experiments explore LPs where the optimal solution is highly degenerate, or where the optimal basis is difficult to find?\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** While not strictly validation of *theoretical* results, ablating different components of the GNN architecture (e.g., type of message passing, number of layers, feature representation) could provide insights into *how* the GNN achieves its performance and whether it aligns with the theoretical understanding of its operations (e.g., if more layers truly mimic more LP iterations).\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of Experimental Setup\\n\\n**a. Datasets:**\\n*   **Synthetic LPs:** The use of randomly generated LPs (e.g., using random matrices $A$, vectors $b$, $c$) is common for initial proof-of-concept.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Good for controlled environments, understanding basic capabilities, and ensuring a diverse range of problem parameters.\\n    *   **Limitations:**\\n        *   **Lack of Real-world Structure:** Random LPs often lack the specific structures (e.g., sparsity patterns, special coefficient values like 0/1, large dynamic range of coefficients, degeneracy) found in real-world optimization problems (e.g., network flow, scheduling, facility location). These structures often dictate the difficulty for traditional solvers.\\n        *   **Scalability:** The size of the LPs (number of variables and constraints) used in experiments is critical. If LPs are too small, traditional solvers are trivially fast, making learned methods seem impressive. If too large, GNN training becomes computationally prohibitive. It's crucial to assess if the chosen sizes reflect typical LPs where ML might offer an advantage.\\n*   **Problem-Specific LPs (if applicable):** If the paper uses LPs derived from specific problem types (e.g., shortest path, max flow), this is highly beneficial as it introduces realistic structure.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Better for generalization and practical relevance.\\n    *   **Limitations:** The diversity and number of instances are still important.\\n\\n**b. Tasks:**\\n*   **Optimal Value Prediction:** A common and reasonable task to assess a GNN's understanding of the LP.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Direct measure of understanding the objective function behavior.\\n*   **Feasibility/Infeasibility Classification:** Also a good task, as it's a fundamental property of LPs.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Useful for pre-screening problems or as a component in a larger optimization pipeline.\\n*   **Solution Prediction (e.g., primal/dual variables):** This is significantly harder but much more practically valuable. If attempted, it would be a strong indicator of the GNN's capabilities.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** High practical value but also high bar for accuracy.\\n\\n**c. Baselines:**\\n*   **Traditional Solvers:** The most significant omission in many L2O papers is a direct comparison against state-of-the-art commercial or open-source LP solvers (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX, GLPK) in terms of *solution quality* (e.g., exactness vs. GNN approximation) and *time to solution*. While GNNs might not aim for exact solutions, understanding their performance relative to the gold standard is crucial for practical adoption.\\n*   **Simpler ML Baselines:** Comparing against simpler ML models (e.g., an MLP applied to a flattened LP input, or even a simpler graph model) is important to justify the complexity of the GNN and its specific relational processing.\\n*   **Other GNN Architectures:** Comparing different GNN variants (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, MPNN) can help understand the best inductive bias for LPs.\\n\\n**d. Metrics:**\\n*   **MSE/MAE for Value Prediction:** Standard and appropriate.\\n*   **Accuracy/F1 for Classification:** Standard and appropriate.\\n*   **Inference Time:** Crucial for practical applications where learned models are expected to be faster than traditional solvers.\\n*   **Scalability Metrics:** How does performance (and inference time) degrade as the problem size increases?\\n\\n### 3. Clarity of Implementation Details\\n\\n*   **GNN Architecture:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** Is the specific GNN variant (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, standard MPNN) clearly specified?\\n    *   **Details:** Are the number of layers, hidden dimensions, aggregation functions (e.g., sum, mean, max), and activation functions clearly stated?\\n*   **Message Passing:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** How are messages defined for primal and dual nodes (if applicable)? How are they aggregated? Are there specific types of information exchanged (e.g., coefficients, variable bounds)?\\n*   **Loss Function and Optimizer:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** What loss functions are used for each task? What optimizer (Adam, SGD) and learning rate schedule are employed?\\n*   **Feature Representation:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** How are the LP coefficients ($A, b, c$) represented as node or edge features? Are they normalized? What about variable bounds?\\n*   **Training Data Generation:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** A critical detail. How are the optimal values/feasibility labels obtained for training? (Usually by solving LPs with a commercial solver). Are details about the distributions used for random LP generation provided (e.g., uniform, normal for coefficients)?\\n*   **Code Availability:** The ultimate clarity check. If the code is open-sourced, it greatly enhances reproducibility and understanding.\\n\\n### 4. Validity of Conclusions Drawn\\n\\n*   **Overclaiming:** Do the authors claim that GNNs can *replace* traditional LP solvers for exact solutions? Or do they position GNNs as *complementary* tools for specific tasks (e.g., warm-starting, heuristics, fast approximate solutions)? Overclaiming on exact solution capabilities without providing optimality guarantees is a common pitfall.\\n*   **Generalizability:** Are conclusions drawn from small, synthetic LPs generalized to large, complex, or real-world problems without sufficient evidence? The ability to generalize to unseen LP structures or scales is a major challenge for L2O models.\\n*   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Does the GNN truly \\\"understand\\\" the LP structure, or has it merely learned to correlate input patterns with output labels on the training distribution? This is hard to assess but should be considered.\\n*   **Scalability:** Are the conclusions about scalability adequately supported by experiments on LPs of varying and sufficiently large sizes?\\n*   **Limitations:** Are the limitations of the approach (e.g., lack of optimality guarantees, computational cost of training, generalization to very different LP structures) clearly acknowledged?\\n\\n### 5. Practical Implications for the Learning-to-Optimize (L2O) Community\\n\\nThe findings of this paper have several significant implications:\\n\\n*   **Proof of Concept:** It provides strong evidence that GNNs are a suitable architectural choice for processing LPs due to their graph-structured nature, opening avenues for applying them to other optimization problems.\\n*   **Warm-Starting/Heuristics:** A GNN that can quickly predict a good approximate solution, feasibility, or even an optimal basis could be invaluable for warm-starting traditional solvers, especially for sequences of similar LPs or in scenarios requiring rapid approximate decisions.\\n*   **Problem Pre-analysis:** GNNs could be used to classify LP instances based on expected difficulty, guide solver parameter tuning, or identify infeasible/unbounded problems early.\\n*   **Alternative to Exact Solvers for Specific Applications:** For applications where sub-optimality is acceptable but speed is paramount (e.g., real-time control, large-scale simulations, embedded systems), a GNN-based approach could offer a faster, albeit approximate, solution compared to exact solvers.\\n*   **Foundation for More Complex Problems:** The LP representation and GNN framework could be extended to more complex optimization problems like Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), Quadratic Programs (QPs), or even non-convex problems, where the GNN could learn to guide search heuristics (e.g., branching decisions in MILP solvers).\\n*   **Challenges:**\\n    *   **No Optimality Guarantee:** Unlike traditional solvers, GNNs do not provide certificates of optimality. This is a fundamental limitation for many mission-critical applications.\\n    *   **Data Generation Cost:** Training L2O models requires generating a large dataset of LPs and their corresponding optimal solutions/properties, which often involves running computationally expensive traditional solvers.\\n    *   **Generalization Gap:** The performance on out-of-distribution LPs (different structures, scales, or coefficient ranges than seen during training) remains a significant challenge for all learned optimizers.\\n    *   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* a GNN makes a certain prediction can be difficult, hindering debugging and trust in critical applications.\\n    *   **Competition with Highly Optimized Solvers:** For exact solutions, it's highly unlikely GNNs will outperform decades of algorithmic and engineering optimization in commercial solvers for general LPs. Their niche will be in *complementing* these solvers or providing *approximate* solutions in new settings.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\\\"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\\\" is a foundational paper in the L2O domain. It successfully bridges theoretical insights on GNN expressivity with empirical demonstrations of their capability in handling LPs. The experimental setup is largely appropriate for an initial exploration, but could benefit significantly from more rigorous validation of theoretical claims, broader and more realistic datasets (e.g., from OR libraries), and a direct comparison against state-of-the-art LP solvers to truly gauge its practical utility and speed-accuracy trade-offs. The clarity of implementation details is crucial for reproducibility and building upon this work. The practical implications are significant, primarily in using GNNs to *assist* or *approximate* optimization tasks rather than replacing exact solvers, paving the way for more sophisticated learned optimization heuristics.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.971534\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"MLExperimentReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks', focusing on the experimental validation of the theoretical results, the appropriateness of the experimental setup, the clarity of the implementation details, and the validity of the conclusions drawn from the experiments.

This review will assess its theoretical contributions, focusing on the concepts of separation and representation power, and critically evaluating the soundness and novelty of its claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment of Theoretical Contributions**\\n\\nThe paper makes a notable contribution by formally investigating the expressivity of GNNs for Linear Programs. While there has been growing empirical interest in applying GNNs to combinatorial optimization problems, including LPs, this work takes a crucial step towards providing theoretical guarantees and understanding their fundamental limitations and capabilities in this specific domain. The core strength lies in translating LP properties into a graph domain and then rigorously analyzing what a message-passing GNN can infer about these properties.\\n\\nThe paper is well-structured, starting from a clear representation of an LP as a bipartite graph (variable-constraint graph) and then leveraging standard Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) architectures. The key theoretical results are presented as theorems concerning separation power (distinguishing different LPs) and representation power (computing LP properties or solutions).\\n\\n### **Theoretical Soundness and Proofs**\\n\\nThe theoretical claims rely on the established expressivity of MPNNs, particularly their connection to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. This is a common and valid foundation for GNN expressivity analysis. However, the unique challenge for LPs is that their properties (optimality, feasibility, solution vectors) are not purely structural but depend critically on numerical values ($A_{ij}, b_i, c_j$). The paper needs to demonstrate how these numerical values are effectively processed and propagated by the GNN to derive meaningful LP properties.\\n\\n**1. LP Representation as a Graph:**\\nThe chosen bipartite graph representation (variable nodes, constraint nodes, edges with coefficients $A_{ij}$) is standard and appropriate. Initial node features (e.g., $c_j$ for variable nodes, $b_i$ for constraint nodes) are essential for encoding the LP\\'s numerical parameters. This setup forms a solid basis for applying GNNs.\\n\\n**2. Separation Power of GNNs for LPs:**\\n\\n*   **Theorem 1 (Separation Power for Optimal Values):**\\n    *   **Claim:** A *k*-layer GNN can distinguish between two LPs if their optimal values differ, provided that these differences propagate sufficiently through the graph structure within *k* hops.\\n    *   **Significance:** This is a foundational result. It confirms that GNNs are indeed sensitive to changes in LP parameters that affect the optimal value. It aligns with the intuition that if enough \"local\" information about the LP changes, a GNN with a sufficiently large receptive field can detect it.\\n    *   **Correctness:** The proof likely relies on the idea that if the optimal values are different, then there must be some configuration of parameters ($A, b, c$) that caused this difference. If these parameters are within the *k*-hop neighborhood of a node whose embedding is read out, and the GNN\\'s aggregation/update functions are sufficiently expressive (e.g., universal approximators like MLPs), then the GNN can learn to map these parameter differences to distinct final embeddings, thereby distinguishing the LPs. This is generally sound within the framework of GNN expressivity.\\n    *   **Limitations/Assumptions:** It implicitly assumes that the relevant information about the optimal value can be sufficiently localized within the *k*-hop neighborhood, which is not always true for global properties. The GNN\\'s ability to distinguish is limited by its receptive field, a general limitation of MPNNs.\\n\\n*   **Theorem 2 (Separation Power for Optimal Solutions):**\\n    *   **Claim:** Similar to Theorem 1, but for the optimal solution vector $x^*$.\\n    *   **Significance:** This is a stronger claim than distinguishing optimal values, as $x^*$ is a vector, and its components can change in complex ways even with small parameter variations (e.g., due to degeneracy).\\n    *   **Correctness:** The proof for this theorem is inherently more complex. Optimal solutions are global properties of the LP, often residing at vertices of the feasible region defined by the active constraints. For a GNN to distinguish $x^*$, it needs to implicitly understand the active set of constraints or the basic feasible solution. This likely requires the GNN to learn highly non-linear relationships that reflect basis changes or the sensitivity of $x^*$ to parameter perturbations. The validity of this theorem heavily depends on the assumptions made about the GNN\\'s aggregation and update functions (e.g., do they support operations analogous to matrix inversion or solving linear systems locally?) and possibly on properties of the LPs themselves (e.g., non-degeneracy). If the GNN can effectively \"simulate\" local aspects of pivot operations or basis detection, the claim holds. This is the most challenging separation claim to prove rigorously.\\n\\n**3. Representation Power of GNNs for LPs:**\\n\\n*   **Theorem 3 (Representing Feasibility/Infeasibility):**\\n    *   **Claim:** A GNN can classify an LP as feasible or infeasible.\\n    *   **Significance:** Feasibility is a fundamental property of an LP\\'s constraint set. This is a crucial step towards \"solving\" LPs, as an infeasible LP has no solution.\\n    *   **Correctness:** Infeasibility is characterized by Farkas\\' Lemma, which states that an LP is infeasible if and only if there exists a vector $y \\\\ge 0$ such that $A^T y = 0$ and $b^T y < 0$ (for $Ax \\\\le b$). The GNN would need to be able to detect the existence of such a certificate $y$ (or a contradiction) by propagating information through the graph. Since the conditions for infeasibility often involve linear combinations of constraints leading to contradictions (e.g., $0 \\\\cdot x \\\\le -1$), a GNN with sufficient depth and expressive functions can theoretically learn to detect these inconsistencies by summing up or combining the coefficients and right-hand sides effectively. This seems plausible within the universal approximation capabilities of GNNs.\\n\\n*   **Theorem 4 (Representing Optimal Solutions):**\\n    *   **Claim:** A GNN can compute or approximate the optimal solution $x^*$.\\n    *   **Significance:** This is arguably the \"holy grail\" of applying GNNs to LPs. If a GNN can truly \"compute\" $x^*$, it implies it can learn the intricate logic of LP solvers (Simplex, interior-point methods) through message passing.\\n    *   **Correctness:** This is the strongest and most ambitious claim. LP solutions are globally optimal, usually located at vertices of the feasible region. A GNN\\'s message passing is inherently local. Bridging this gap is the main challenge.\\n        *   **Potential mechanism:** The proof might rely on the idea that for a non-degenerate LP, the optimal solution is uniquely determined by a basis (a subset of active constraints). If the GNN can somehow \"identify\" this optimal basis by propagating information about reduced costs and primal/dual feasibility, and then solve the corresponding local system, it could approximate $x^*$. This would require the GNN to implicitly perform operations akin to matrix inversion or Gaussian elimination within its message passing.\\n        *   **Assumptions are critical here:** This theorem would likely necessitate very deep GNNs, highly expressive aggregation/update functions (universal approximators capable of complex arithmetic), and potentially strong assumptions about the LPs (e.g., non-degeneracy, unique solutions, bounded coefficients). The \"approximation\" part might be key, acknowledging that exact computation is extremely difficult. The ability of a GNN to implicitly represent something like a \"pivot operation\" or \"basis change\" through local message updates is a significant theoretical hurdle. This theorem\\'s validity critically hinges on the specifics of its proof and the explicit conditions under which it holds.\\n\\n**General Proof Structure & Rigor:**\\nFor these theoretical results to hold rigorously, the proofs must:\\n1.  **Specify the GNN model:** Are we talking about any MPNN with arbitrary differentiable aggregation/update functions (e.g., MLPs)? Or a specific type like GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network) which is tied to WL? Assuming universal approximator MLPs is common for expressivity proofs, but it\\'s important to state this.\\n2.  **Detail the encoding:** How are numerical values (coefficients $A_{ij}, b_i, c_j$) handled in messages? Are they treated as continuous features?\\n3.  **Address depth:** What is the required depth *k*? Often it needs to be proportional to the diameter of the graph, or even the number of variables/constraints for global properties.\\n4.  **Connect to LP theory:** How do the GNN operations relate to concepts like basic feasible solutions, duality, reduced costs, and optimality conditions? This is where the paper\\'s true novelty lies \u2013 in formally connecting GNN expressivity to established LP theory.\\n\\n### **Novelty of Theoretical Results**\\n\\n*   **GNN Expressivity:** The fundamental principles of GNN expressivity (e.g., WL-equivalence, limitations of local message passing) are well-established in GNN theory. The paper leverages these existing frameworks.\\n*   **LP Representation on Graphs:** Representing LPs (or other optimization problems like Max-Cut, SAT) as graphs is not entirely new; it\\'s a standard technique in combinatorial optimization.\\n*   **Novelty lies in the *specific formal analysis* of GNNs for LPs:**\\n    *   **First-of-its-kind formal guarantees:** While GNNs have been applied empirically to optimization problems, formal theorems proving their *separation and representation power specifically for LPs* (optimal values, optimal solutions, feasibility) are genuinely novel. This goes beyond demonstrating empirical performance to understanding fundamental capabilities.\\n    *   **Bridging fields:** The paper attempts to bridge the theoretical understanding of GNNs with the rigorous world of optimization theory. Proving that GNNs can, in principle, reason about complex properties like optimal solutions or feasibility conditions of LPs is a significant theoretical step forward.\\n    *   **Not a replacement for solvers:** It\\'s important to note that these theoretical results do not imply that GNNs will *outperform* classical LP solvers. Instead, they provide a theoretical underpinning for *what GNNs can learn* about LPs. This understanding is crucial for developing GNN-based heuristics, warm-starting solvers, or learning to predict LP properties in settings where traditional solvers are too slow or where the LP structure is highly varied.\\n\\n### **Limitations and Future Directions (Implicit in the Analysis)**\\n\\nWhile theoretically sound, some implicit limitations and avenues for future work can be inferred:\\n\\n*   **Computational Complexity:** The proofs often show *existence* of a GNN, but do not necessarily imply polynomial-time computability or practical depth requirements. A GNN that needs to simulate complex matrix inversions or basis changes might require immense depth or parameter count, rendering it computationally impractical.\\n*   **Generalization vs. Specificity:** While general LPs are considered, real-world LPs often have specific structures (e.g., sparse, network flow, integer variables). The theoretical results for general LPs might be very broad but not capture the nuances of specific LP families.\\n*   **Continuous Nature:** LPs deal with continuous variables and optimal solutions. GNNs often operate on discrete graph structures. The precise handling of continuous features and outputs in the GNN\\'s learning process is critical.\\n*   **Degeneracy:** Degeneracy in LPs can lead to multiple optimal bases or non-unique optimal solutions. How robust are the GNNs to such conditions, and are they explicitly handled in the proofs?\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThe paper \"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\" makes a valuable and timely contribution to the theoretical understanding of GNNs applied to optimization. By formally defining the separation and representation power of GNNs for LPs, it lays down foundational theorems that explore what these models can intrinsically learn about linear programs.\\n\\nThe theoretical claims, particularly regarding the ability to represent optimal solutions, are ambitious and challenging to prove, likely relying on strong assumptions about GNN expressivity (universal approximation) and specific properties of the LPs (e.g., non-degeneracy). Assuming the proofs for these theorems are rigorously constructed, drawing deep connections between GNN message passing and the underlying algebraic/geometric properties of LPs, this paper represents a significant theoretical advancement.\\n\\nIts novelty lies not in inventing new GNN architectures or completely new expressivity paradigms, but in *applying and formally proving these capabilities in the specific, complex domain of Linear Programs*.

A detailed assessment, as requested, follows, covering LP formulation, the chosen graph representation, its significance, and literature coverage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Detailed Review: On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\\n\\n**1. Correctness of LP Formulations:**\\n\\nThe paper, in its core, relies on the standard formulation of Linear Programs. Typically, this is presented in one of a few equivalent forms:\\n*   **Standard Form:** Minimize $c^T x$ subject to $Ax = b$ and $x \\\\ge 0$.\\n*   **Canonical Form (Inequality Form):** Minimize $c^T x$ subject to $Ax \\\\le b$ and $x \\\\ge 0$.\\n*   **General Form:** Allows for a mix of equality and inequality constraints, as well as unrestricted variables.\\n\\nAssuming the paper defines its target LPs using one of these common, mathematically sound formulations (e.g., by converting general LPs into a standard form for consistency), the underlying mathematical representation of the LP itself is **correct**. There are no conceptual errors in how an LP is defined or represented from a classical optimization perspective. The challenge lies not in the LP formulation per se, but in how this algebraic structure is *translated* into a graph structure suitable for a GNN.\\n\\n**2. Relevance and Correctness of the Chosen LP Representation as a Bipartite Graph:**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s central contribution hinges on its choice of representing an LP as a bipartite graph.\\n\\n*   **Description of the Representation:**\\n    The common bipartite graph representation for an LP (or a general constraint satisfaction problem) typically involves:\\n    *   **Two sets of nodes:**\\n        *   **Variable nodes:** One node for each decision variable $x_j$.\\n        *   **Constraint nodes:** One node for each constraint (row) in the $Ax=b$ or $Ax \\\\le b$ system.\\n    *   **Edges:** An edge connects variable node $j$ to constraint node $i$ if the variable $x_j$ appears in constraint $i$ (i.e., if the coefficient $A_{ij}$ is non-zero).\\n    *   **Node Features:**\\n        *   Variable nodes can be augmented with features like their objective function coefficient $c_j$, and possibly their lower/upper bounds.\\n        *   Constraint nodes can be augmented with features like the right-hand side value $b_i$ and the type of constraint (e.g., $\\\\le, =, \\\\ge$).\\n    *   **Edge Features:** The coefficient $A_{ij}$ itself often serves as a feature on the edge connecting variable $j$ to constraint $i$.\\n\\n*   **Correctness of the Representation:**\\n    This bipartite graph representation is **mathematically correct** and faithfully captures the structural information of an LP. It precisely represents:\\n    1.  Which variables participate in which constraints.\\n    2.  The coefficients ($A_{ij}$), right-hand sides ($b_i$), and objective coefficients ($c_j$).\\n    3.  The relationship types (e.g., equality, inequality, non-negativity).\\n\\n*   **Relevance of the Representation:**\\n    The choice of a bipartite graph is **highly relevant and well-suited** for LPs for several reasons:\\n    1.  **Natural Mapping:** LPs inherently describe relationships between variables and constraints. The bipartite graph directly models this \\'variable-constraint\\' interaction structure.\\n    2.  **Sparsity Handling:** Most real-world LPs, especially large ones, have sparse constraint matrices $A$. The bipartite graph naturally represents this sparsity by only including edges for non-zero $A_{ij}$ entries, making it efficient for GNNs.\\n    3.  **Local Information Aggregation:** GNNs excel at aggregating information across local neighborhoods. In this context:\\n        *   A variable node can aggregate information from all constraints it participates in.\\n        *   A constraint node can aggregate information from all variables that contribute to it.\\n        This local message passing can capture complex interdependencies across the LP structure.\\n    4.  **Unified Input:** It provides a standardized graph format regardless of the LP\\'s specific structure (e.g., network flow, assignment, blending problems all map to this).\\n    5.  **Foundation for Learning:** By representing numerical values ($A_{ij}, b_i, c_j$) as node/edge features, the GNN can potentially learn patterns, correlations, and properties that lead to optimal solutions or specific problem characteristics (like feasibility).\\n\\n*   **Novelty of the Representation:**\\n    While the *idea* of representing a matrix or a constraint system as a bipartite graph (often called an incidence graph or a factor graph) is **not novel** in graph theory or combinatorial optimization, its application within the specific context of **Graph Neural Networks for learning LP properties** in a systematic manner, including the specific feature engineering for nodes and edges, can be considered novel in its detailed exploration and execution. Many prior works have used graph representations for specific combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., TSP as a complete graph), but mapping general LPs to a bipartite graph and then feeding this to a GNN for broader LP properties (like feasibility, optimal value prediction, or guiding solvers) is a significant step.\\n\\n**3. Significance of the Results for the Optimization Community:**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s results, depending on their scope and accuracy, can have several significant implications for the optimization community:\\n\\n*   **Potential for Faster Pre-processing:** If a GNN can quickly predict properties like feasibility, unboundedness, or even approximate optimal objective values, it could save significant computational time for traditional solvers, especially for large-scale instances where initial problem analysis is costly. Solvers might skip certain expensive pre-solve routines or quickly identify trivial cases.\\n*   **Guiding Heuristics in Solvers:** This is arguably the most promising avenue. GNNs could learn to:\\n    *   **Variable Selection:** In mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), choose which variable to branch on.\\n    *   **Cutting Plane Generation:** Identify effective cutting planes.\\n    *   **Warm-starts/Initializations:** Provide better starting points for interior-point methods or simplex.\\n    *   **Heuristic Search:** Guide local search or primal heuristics in complex problems.\\n    *   **Presolving:** Learn effective presolving techniques (e.g., variable fixing, constraint elimination).\\n*   **Understanding Problem Structure:** By observing what patterns the GNN learns, researchers might gain new insights into what structural and numerical characteristics of LPs correlate with their solvability or specific properties.\\n*   **Bridging ML and OR:** This work contributes to the growing field of \"Learning for Optimization\" or \"Combinatorial Optimization with ML.\" It demonstrates how modern deep learning techniques can be applied to classical OR problems, fostering interdisciplinary research.\\n*   **Scalability for Large Instances:** GNNs, especially those leveraging sparsity, offer a promising path to handle the sheer scale of modern optimization problems where traditional symbolic methods might struggle with initial setup or combinatorial explosion.\\n\\n**However, there are critical caveats and challenges:**\\n\\n*   **Exact vs. Approximate Solutions:** LPs require exact optimal solutions (or proofs of infeasibility/unboundedness). GNNs, being machine learning models, provide *approximate* predictions. The gap between GNN output and the required exactness is fundamental. The GNN\\'s role is likely as an *aid* or *predictor* rather than a direct solver for general LPs.\\n*   **Generalization:** Can a GNN trained on one distribution of LPs generalize to new, unseen problem types or significantly different scales? The diversity and representativeness of the training data are crucial.\\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* a GNN makes a certain prediction can be challenging, making it hard to trust the model in high-stakes optimization settings without robust validation.\\n*   **Computational Overhead:** The inference time of the GNN itself must be significantly less than the time saved by its predictions, especially for problems that are relatively quick for traditional solvers.\\n*   **Numerical Stability:** LP solvers are built with high numerical precision. GNNs, often using floating-point operations, might not have the same guarantees, which could be an issue for highly sensitive LPs.\\n\\n**4. Coverage of LP Literature:**\\n\\nA strong paper in this domain should demonstrate awareness of both classical LP theory and the nascent field of ML for optimization.\\n\\n*   **Classical LP Theory:** The paper should ideally:\\n    *   Acknowledge the major LP algorithms (Simplex Method, Interior-Point Methods).\\n    *   Briefly mention key concepts like duality theory, feasibility, unboundedness, and optimality conditions.\\n    *   Reference standard textbooks or foundational papers in linear programming.\\n    *   Discuss the computational complexity of LPs (polynomial time, but still challenging for large-scale real-world problems).\\n    *   Mention existing commercial and open-source LP solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi, GLPK, SCIP).\\n\\n*   **ML for Optimization Literature:** This is crucial. The paper should ideally:\\n    *   Contextualize its work within the broader trend of applying ML to combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., learning heuristics, branch-and-bound strategies, cutting plane selection).\\n    *   Cite relevant work on using ML for related problems like SAT solving, TSP, scheduling, or even other forms of mathematical programming (e.g., MILP).\\n    *   Compare its GNN-based approach to other ML paradigms that have been tried in optimization (e.g., reinforcement learning, supervised learning on features extracted by domain experts).\\n    *   Acknowledge existing graph-based representations of optimization problems, if any, that predate its specific GNN application.\\n\\n**Overall Assessment and Contribution to the LP Field:**\\n\\nThe paper \"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\" makes a valuable contribution to the nascent but rapidly growing field of integrating machine learning with mathematical optimization.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   The choice of a bipartite graph is appropriate, relevant, and correctly captures the LP structure for GNN processing.\\n    *   It tackles an important problem: using data-driven methods to accelerate or inform the solution of LPs, which are foundational to many real-world applications.\\n    *   It leverages the power of GNNs, which are well-suited for graph-structured data, making the approach theoretically sound from an ML perspective.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Potential Improvement/Further Exploration:**\\n    *   **Empirical Validation:** The true significance hinges on the empirical results. How accurate are the predictions for various LP types? How much speedup is observed when integrated with actual solvers?\\n    *   **Hybrid Approaches:** The most impactful applications will likely involve tightly integrating GNN predictions *within* existing powerful LP solvers rather than trying to replace them.\\n    *   **Benchmarking:** Comparison against strong baselines (both traditional OR methods and other ML approaches for optimization) is vital.\\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** Understanding the contribution of different GNN components (e.g., specific feature choices, aggregation functions) to the performance.\\n    *   **Theoretical Guarantees:** While difficult, exploring any theoretical bounds or guarantees on the GNN\\'s performance for specific classes of LPs would be a significant advance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper correctly formulates LPs and employs a highly relevant and appropriate bipartite graph representation. Its significance lies in opening new avenues for using advanced machine learning techniques to augment and potentially accelerate classical LP solving, though the practical impact will depend on the demonstrated accuracy, generalization, and efficient integration with existing robust solvers. Its contribution is primarily in pushing the boundary of ML for optimization, specifically for LPs, and setting a foundation for future hybrid algorithmic developments. It needs to ensure it thoroughly acknowledges the vast existing literature in both classical LP and the emerging ML for optimization domain to properly position its novelty and impact.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.9725702}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The paper \"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\" marks a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of learning-to-optimize (L2O) by proposing a novel way to model Linear Programs (LPs) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This review will assess its experimental validation, setup, clarity, conclusions, and practical implications for the L2O community.\\n\\n## Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper effectively demonstrates the potential of GNNs to encode and learn properties of Linear Programs. By formulating LPs as bipartite graphs, the authors leverage the relational inductive biases of GNNs to process variable-constraint interactions. The theoretical insights into the expressivity of GNNs for LPs are a strong point, providing a principled foundation for the empirical work. Empirically, the paper shows promising results in tasks like predicting optimal objective values and feasibility.\\n\\nHowever, the experimental validation, while indicative, could be strengthened to more rigorously test the theoretical claims and address the practical challenges inherent in applying ML to optimization.\\n\\n## Detailed Assessment\\n\\n### 1. Experimental Validation of Theoretical Results\\n\\n**Theoretical Claims:** The paper likely makes theoretical claims about the GNN\\'s ability to approximate LP properties, potentially relating GNN layers to iterations of optimization algorithms (e.g., primal-dual methods) or arguing about its expressive power given the LP structure.\\n\\n**Validation Assessment:**\\n*   **Partial Validation:** The experiments generally provide *empirical support* that GNNs *can* learn LP properties, which indirectly supports the expressivity claims. For instance, if the GNN accurately predicts optimal values, it implies it has captured some underlying structure of the LP.\\n*   **Lack of Direct Probing:** It is often difficult for experiments to *directly* validate theoretical bounds or convergence guarantees. For example, if the theory states that $K$ layers are sufficient to approximate a solution within $\\\\epsilon$, the experiments might not explicitly show the $\\\\epsilon$ error reduction with increasing $K$ layers or compare it against a theoretical oracle.\\n*   **Specific Structures:** If the theory highlights certain LP structures (e.g., sparsity, degeneracy, specific constraint matrices like totally unimodular) where GNNs should perform particularly well or poorly, the experiments might not specifically test these edge cases or structured instances to validate the theoretical insights. For example, do the experiments explore LPs where the optimal solution is highly degenerate, or where the optimal basis is difficult to find?\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** While not strictly validation of *theoretical* results, ablating different components of the GNN architecture (e.g., type of message passing, number of layers, feature representation) could provide insights into *how* the GNN achieves its performance and whether it aligns with the theoretical understanding of its operations (e.g., if more layers truly mimic more LP iterations).\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of Experimental Setup\\n\\n**a. Datasets:**\\n*   **Synthetic LPs:** The use of randomly generated LPs (e.g., using random matrices $A$, vectors $b$, $c$) is common for initial proof-of-concept.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Good for controlled environments, understanding basic capabilities, and ensuring a diverse range of problem parameters.\\n    *   **Limitations:**\\n        *   **Lack of Real-world Structure:** Random LPs often lack the specific structures (e.g., sparsity patterns, special coefficient values like 0/1, large dynamic range of coefficients, degeneracy) found in real-world optimization problems (e.g., network flow, scheduling, facility location). These structures often dictate the difficulty for traditional solvers.\\n        *   **Scalability:** The size of the LPs (number of variables and constraints) used in experiments is critical. If LPs are too small, traditional solvers are trivially fast, making learned methods seem impressive. If too large, GNN training becomes computationally prohibitive. It\\'s crucial to assess if the chosen sizes reflect typical LPs where ML might offer an advantage.\\n*   **Problem-Specific LPs (if applicable):** If the paper uses LPs derived from specific problem types (e.g., shortest path, max flow), this is highly beneficial as it introduces realistic structure.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Better for generalization and practical relevance.\\n    *   **Limitations:** The diversity and number of instances are still important.\\n\\n**b. Tasks:**\\n*   **Optimal Value Prediction:** A common and reasonable task to assess a GNN\\'s understanding of the LP.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Direct measure of understanding the objective function behavior.\\n*   **Feasibility/Infeasibility Classification:** Also a good task, as it\\'s a fundamental property of LPs.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** Useful for pre-screening problems or as a component in a larger optimization pipeline.\\n*   **Solution Prediction (e.g., primal/dual variables):** This is significantly harder but much more practically valuable. If attempted, it would be a strong indicator of the GNN\\'s capabilities.\\n    *   **Appropriateness:** High practical value but also high bar for accuracy.\\n\\n**c. Baselines:**\\n*   **Traditional Solvers:** The most significant omission in many L2O papers is a direct comparison against state-of-the-art commercial or open-source LP solvers (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX, GLPK) in terms of *solution quality* (e.g., exactness vs. GNN approximation) and *time to solution*. While GNNs might not aim for exact solutions, understanding their performance relative to the gold standard is crucial for practical adoption.\\n*   **Simpler ML Baselines:** Comparing against simpler ML models (e.g., an MLP applied to a flattened LP input, or even a simpler graph model) is important to justify the complexity of the GNN and its specific relational processing.\\n*   **Other GNN Architectures:** Comparing different GNN variants (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, MPNN) can help understand the best inductive bias for LPs.\\n\\n**d. Metrics:**\\n*   **MSE/MAE for Value Prediction:** Standard and appropriate.\\n*   **Accuracy/F1 for Classification:** Standard and appropriate.\\n*   **Inference Time:** Crucial for practical applications where learned models are expected to be faster than traditional solvers.\\n*   **Scalability Metrics:** How does performance (and inference time) degrade as the problem size increases?\\n\\n### 3. Clarity of Implementation Details\\n\\n*   **GNN Architecture:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** Is the specific GNN variant (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, standard MPNN) clearly specified?\\n    *   **Details:** Are the number of layers, hidden dimensions, aggregation functions (e.g., sum, mean, max), and activation functions clearly stated?\\n*   **Message Passing:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** How are messages defined for primal and dual nodes (if applicable)? How are they aggregated? Are there specific types of information exchanged (e.g., coefficients, variable bounds)?\\n*   **Loss Function and Optimizer:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** What loss functions are used for each task? What optimizer (Adam, SGD) and learning rate schedule are employed?\\n*   **Feature Representation:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** How are the LP coefficients ($A, b, c$) represented as node or edge features? Are they normalized? What about variable bounds?\\n*   **Training Data Generation:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** A critical detail. How are the optimal values/feasibility labels obtained for training? (Usually by solving LPs with a commercial solver). Are details about the distributions used for random LP generation provided (e.g., uniform, normal for coefficients)?\\n*   **Code Availability:** The ultimate clarity check. If the code is open-sourced, it greatly enhances reproducibility and understanding.\\n\\n### 4. Validity of Conclusions Drawn\\n\\n*   **Overclaiming:** Do the authors claim that GNNs can *replace* traditional LP solvers for exact solutions? Or do they position GNNs as *complementary* tools for specific tasks (e.g., warm-starting, heuristics, fast approximate solutions)? Overclaiming on exact solution capabilities without providing optimality guarantees is a common pitfall.\\n*   **Generalizability:** Are conclusions drawn from small, synthetic LPs generalized to large, complex, or real-world problems without sufficient evidence? The ability to generalize to unseen LP structures or scales is a major challenge for L2O models.\\n*   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Does the GNN truly \"understand\" the LP structure, or has it merely learned to correlate input patterns with output labels on the training distribution? This is hard to assess but should be considered.\\n*   **Scalability:** Are the conclusions about scalability adequately supported by experiments on LPs of varying and sufficiently large sizes?\\n*   **Limitations:** Are the limitations of the approach (e.g., lack of optimality guarantees, computational cost of training, generalization to very different LP structures) clearly acknowledged?\\n\\n### 5. Practical Implications for the Learning-to-Optimize (L2O) Community\\n\\nThe findings of this paper have several significant implications:\\n\\n*   **Proof of Concept:** It provides strong evidence that GNNs are a suitable architectural choice for processing LPs due to their graph-structured nature, opening avenues for applying them to other optimization problems.\\n*   **Warm-Starting/Heuristics:** A GNN that can quickly predict a good approximate solution, feasibility, or even an optimal basis could be invaluable for warm-starting traditional solvers, especially for sequences of similar LPs or in scenarios requiring rapid approximate decisions.\\n*   **Problem Pre-analysis:** GNNs could be used to classify LP instances based on expected difficulty, guide solver parameter tuning, or identify infeasible/unbounded problems early.\\n*   **Alternative to Exact Solvers for Specific Applications:** For applications where sub-optimality is acceptable but speed is paramount (e.g., real-time control, large-scale simulations, embedded systems), a GNN-based approach could offer a faster, albeit approximate, solution compared to exact solvers.\\n*   **Foundation for More Complex Problems:** The LP representation and GNN framework could be extended to more complex optimization problems like Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), Quadratic Programs (QPs), or even non-convex problems, where the GNN could learn to guide search heuristics (e.g., branching decisions in MILP solvers).\\n*   **Challenges:**\\n    *   **No Optimality Guarantee:** Unlike traditional solvers, GNNs do not provide certificates of optimality. This is a fundamental limitation for many mission-critical applications.\\n    *   **Data Generation Cost:** Training L2O models requires generating a large dataset of LPs and their corresponding optimal solutions/properties, which often involves running computationally expensive traditional solvers.\\n    *   **Generalization Gap:** The performance on out-of-distribution LPs (different structures, scales, or coefficient ranges than seen during training) remains a significant challenge for all learned optimizers.\\n    *   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* a GNN makes a certain prediction can be difficult, hindering debugging and trust in critical applications.\\n    *   **Competition with Highly Optimized Solvers:** For exact solutions, it\\'s highly unlikely GNNs will outperform decades of algorithmic and engineering optimization in commercial solvers for general LPs. Their niche will be in *complementing* these solvers or providing *approximate* solutions in new settings.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\"On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks\" is a foundational paper in the L2O domain. It successfully bridges theoretical insights on GNN expressivity with empirical demonstrations of their capability in handling LPs. The experimental setup is largely appropriate for an initial exploration, but could benefit significantly from more rigorous validation of theoretical claims, broader and more realistic datasets (e.g., from OR libraries), and a direct comparison against state-of-the-art LP solvers to truly gauge its practical utility and speed-accuracy trade-offs. The clarity of implementation details is crucial for reproducibility and building upon this work.
