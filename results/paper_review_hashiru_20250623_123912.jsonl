The paper title is: A Scalable and Exact Gaussian Process Sampler via Kernel Packets\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Gaussian processes (GPs) have been widely used in statistical and machine learning applications (Rasmussen, 2003; Cressie, 2015; Santner et al., 2003). The relevant areas and topics include regression (O\u2019Hagan, 1978; Bishop et al., 1995; Rasmussen, 2003; MacKay et al., 2003), classification (Kuss et al., 2005; Nickisch & Rasmussen, 2008; Hensman et al., 2015), Bayesian networks (Neal, 2012), optimization (Srinivas et al., 2009), and so on. GP modeling proceeds by imposing a GP as the prior of an underlying continuous function, which provides a flexible nonparametric framework for prediction and inference problems. When the sample size is large, the basic framework for GP regression suffers from the computational challenge of inverting large covariance matrices. A lot of work has been done to address this issue. Recent advances in scalable GP regression include Nystro\u0308m approximation (Quinonero-Candela & Rasmussen, 2005; Titsias, 2009; Hensman et al., 2013), random Fourier features (Rahimi & Recht, 2007), local approximation (Gramacy & Apley, 2015), structured kernel interpolation (Wilson & Nickisch, 2015), Vecchia approximation (Katzfuss & Guinness, 2021), sparse representation (Chen et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2021), etc. In this article, we focus on the sampling of random GP realizations. Such GPs can be either the prior stochastic processes, or the posterior processes in GP regression. Generating random sample paths of the GP prior or the posterior of the GP regression is crucial in machine learning areas such as Bayesian Optimization (Snoek et al., 2012; Frazier, 2018a;b), reinforcement learning (Kuss & Rasmussen, 2003; Engel et al., 2005; Grande et al., 2014), and inverse problems in uncertainty quantification (Murray-Smith & Pearlmutter, 2004; Marzouk & Najm, 2009; Teckentrup, 2020). To generate the function of a random GP sample, a common practice is to discretize the input space, and the problem becomes the sampling of a high-dimensional multivariate normal vector. Sampling high-dimensional multivariate normal vectors, however, is computationally challenging as well, as we need to factorize the large covariance matrices. The ideas of most scalable GP regression methods are not applicable to the sampling problem. Existing scalable sampling algorithms for GPs are scarce. A recent prominent work is done by Wilson et al. (2020). They proposed an efficient sampling approach called decoupled sampling by exploiting Matheron\u2019s rule and combining Nystro\u0308m approximation and random Fourier feature. They also generalized it to pathwise conditioning (Wilson et al., 2021) based on Matheron\u2019s update, which only needs the sampling from GP priors and is a powerful tool for both reasoning about and working with GPs. Motivated by those work, Maddox et al. (2021) extended Matheron\u2019s rule for multi-task GPs and applied it to Bayesian optimization; Nguyen et al. (2021) proposed the first use of such bounds to improve Gaussian process posterior sampling. It is worth noting that each of the above methods enforces a certain approximation scheme to facilitate rapid computation, i.e., none of these methods draws random samples from the theoretical Gaussian distributions exactly. In this paper, we propose algorithms of sampling from GP priors and GP regression posteriors exactly for one-dimension Mate\u0301rn kernel with half integer smoothness \u03bd, then we extend it to noiseless data in multi-dimension. We introduce the kernel packet (KP) (Chen et al., 2022) as a major tool for sampling and reduce the time complexity toO(\u03bd3n). This produces a linear-time exact sampler if \u03bd is not too large. Specifically, our work makes the following contributions: \u2022 We propose an exact sampling method for Gaussian processes with (product) Mate\u0301rn correlations on one-dimensional or multi-dimensional gird points. The computational time grows linearly in the size of the grid points. \u2022 We propose an exact and scalable sampler for the posterior Gaussian processes based on one-dimensional data or multi-dimensional data on full grid designs. \u2022 We demonstrate the value of the proposed algorithm in the Bayesian optimization and dynamical system problems. 2 BACKGROUND: This section covers the related background of the proposed method. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 introduce GPs, GP regression, and the basic method of GP sampling. In section 2.3, we review a newly introduced covariance matrix representation called the Kernel Packet (KP) (Chen et al., 2022), which will help expedite the GP sampling. 2.1 GPS AND GP REGRESSION: A GP is a stochastic process whose finite-dimensional distributions are multivariate normal. The probability law of a GP is uniquely determined by its mean function \u00b5(\u00b7) and covariance function K(\u00b7, \u00b7), and we denote this GP as GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). Let f : X \u2192 R be an unknown function, X \u2286 Rd. Suppose the training set consists of n Gaussian observations yi = f(xi) + \u03f5i with noise \u03f5i \u223c N (0, \u03c32\u03f5 ). In GP regression, we impose the prior f \u223c GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). Suppose that we have observed y = ( y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn )T on n distinct points X = {xi}ni=1. The posterior of f given the data is also a GP. Specifically, the posterior evaluation at m untried inputs X\u2217 = {x\u2217i }mi=1 follows f\u2217|y \u223c N (\u00b5\u2217|n,K\u2217,\u2217|n) with (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006): \u00b5\u2217|n = \u00b5\u2217 +K\u2217,n [ Kn,n + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 In ]\u22121 (y \u2212 \u00b5n) , (1) K\u2217,\u2217|n = \u03c3 2 ( K\u2217,\u2217 \u2212K\u2217,n [ Kn,n + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 In ]\u22121 Kn,\u2217 ) , (2) where \u03c32 > 0 is the variance of GP, In is a n \u00d7 n identity matrix, K\u2217,n = K(x\u2217,X) =( K(X,x\u2217) )T = KTn,\u2217 = ( K(x\u2217,x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K(x\u2217,xn) ) , Kn,n = [ K(xi,xs) ]n i,s=1 , K\u2217,\u2217 =[ K(x\u2217i ,x \u2217 s) ]m i,s=1 , \u00b5n = ( \u00b5(x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b5(xn) )T and \u00b5\u2217 = ( \u00b5(x\u22171), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b5(x\u2217m) )T . In this work, we focus on Mate\u0301rn correlation functions. One-dimensional Mate\u0301rn correlation functions (Stein, 1999) are defined as K(x, x\u2032) = 21\u2212\u03bd \u0393(\u03bd) (\u221a 2\u03bd |x\u2212 x\u2032| \u03c9 )\u03bd K\u03bd (\u221a 2\u03bd |x\u2212 x\u2032| \u03c9 ) , (3) for any x, x\u2032 \u2208 R, where \u03c32 > 0 is the variance, \u03bd > 0 is the smoothness parameter, \u03c9 > 0 is the lengthscale and K\u03bd is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. GPs with Mate\u0301rn correlations form a rich family with finite smoothness; their sample paths are \u2308\u03bd\u22121\u2309 times differentiable (Santner et al., 2003). By virtue of its flexibility, Mate\u0301rn family is deemed a popular choice of correlation functions in spatial statistics (Diggle et al., 2003), geostatistics (Curriero, 2006; Pardo-Iguzquiza & Chica-Olmo, 2008), image analysis (Zafari et al., 2020; Okhrin et al., 2020), and other applications. A common choice of multi-dimensional correlation structure is the \u201cseparable\u201d or \u201cproduct\u201d correlations, given by K(x,x\u2032) = d\u220f j=1 Kj(xj , x \u2032 j), (4) for any x,x\u2032 \u2208 Rd where Kj is the one-dimensional Mate\u0301rn correlation function for each j. The assumption of separability is used extensively in spatio-temporal statistics (Gneiting et al., 2006; Genton, 2007; Constantinou et al., 2017) because it allows for a simple construction of valid spacetime parametric models and facilitates the computational procedures for large datasets in inference and parameter estimation. 2.2 SAMPLING: The goal is to sample f(\u00b7) \u223c GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). To achieve a finite representation, we discretize the input space and consider the function values over a set of grid points Z = {zi}pi=1, and the objective is to generate samples fp = ( f(z1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , f(zp) )T from multivariate normal distribution N (\u00b5(Z),K(Z,Z)) = N (\u00b5p,Kp,p). The standard sampling method of a multivariate normal distribution is as follows: 1) generate a vector of samples fp,0 whose entries are independent and identically distributed normal, 2) employ the Cholesky decomposition (Golub & Van Loan, 2013) to factorize the covariance matrix Kp,p as CpCTp = Kp,p, 3) generate the output sample fp as fp \u2190 Cpfp,0 + \u00b5p. (5) Sampling a posterior GP can be done in a similar manner. Suppose we have observations y =( y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn )T on n distinct points X = {xi}ni=1, where yi = f(xi) + \u03f5i with noise \u03f5i \u223c N (0, \u03c32\u03f5 ) and f \u223c GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). The goal is to generate posterior samples f\u2217|y at m test points X\u2217 = {x\u2217i }mi=1. Because the posterior samples f\u2217|y \u223c N (\u00b5\u2217|n,K\u2217,\u2217|n) are also multivariate normal distributed according to (1) and (2) in Section 2.1, we can do Cholesky decomposition C\u2217|nCT\u2217|n = K\u2217,\u2217|n, and generate GP posterior sample as f\u2217|y\u2190 C\u2217|nfn,0 + \u00b5\u2217|n, (6) where fn,0 \u223c N (0, In). 2.3 KERNEL PACKETS: In this section, we review the theory and methods of kernel packets by Chen et al. (2022). Suppose K(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a one-dimensional Mate\u0301rn kernel defined in (3), and one-dimensional input points X is ordered and distinct. Let K = span{K(\u00b7, xj)}nj=1. Then there exists a collection of linearly independent functions {\u03d5i}ni=1 \u2282 K, such that each \u03d5i = \u2211n j=1 A (i) j K(x, xj) has a compact support. Then covariance matrix Kn,n = K(X,X) is connected to a sparse matrix \u03d5(X) in the following way: Kn,nAX = \u03d5(X), (7) where both AX and \u03d5(X) are banded matrices, the (l, i)th entry of \u03d5(X) is \u03d5i(xl). The matrix AX consists of the coefficients to construct the KPs, and specifically, A (i) j is the (j, i) th entry of AX. In view of the sparse representation and the compact supportedness of \u03d5j , the bandwidth of AX is (k\u2212 1)/2, the bandwidth of \u03d5(X) is (k\u2212 3)/2, k := 2\u03bd + 2, \u03bd is the smoothness parameter in (3). We defer the detailed algorithm to establish the factorization (7) to Appendix A.1. Here we only emphasize that the algorithm to find AX and \u03d5(X) takes only O(\u03bd3n) operations and O(\u03bdn) storage. Based on (7), we can substitute AX and \u03d5(\u00b7) for K(\u00b7,X) in (1), (2) and rewrite the equations as follows: \u00b5\u2217|n = \u00b5\u2217 + \u03d5 T (X\u2217) [ \u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 AX ]\u22121 (y \u2212 \u00b5n) , (8) K\u2217,\u2217|n = \u03c3 2 ( K\u2217,\u2217 \u2212 \u03d5T (X\u2217) [ ATX\u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 ATXAX ]\u22121 \u03d5(X\u2217) ) , (9) Because \u03d5(X) and AX are both banded matrices, the summations \u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32AX and \u03c3 2\u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5AX are also banded matrices. Therefore, the time complexity of matrix inversion via KPs is only O(\u03bd3n). 3 SAMPLING WITH KERNEL PACKETS: In this section, we present the main algorithms for sampling from Gaussian process priors and posteriors based on the KP technique. We introduce the algorithms of sampling from one-dimensional GP and multi-dimensional GP respectively in sections 3.1 and 3.2. 3.1 SAMPLING FROM ONE-DIMENSIONAL GPS: Consider one-dimensional GPs with Mate\u0301rn correlations for half integer smoothness \u03bd. Sampling from the prior distribution For a set of grid points Z = {zi}pi=1, we first compute the sparse matrices AZ and \u03d5(Z) in (7). Now, instead of a direct Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix Kp,p = K(Z,Z), we consider the Cholesky decomposition of the symmetric positive definite matrix RZ := ATZ\u03d5(Z). This shifting makes a significant difference: Kp,p is a dense matrix, and the Cholesky decomposition takes O(n3) time. In contrast, RZ, as a multiplication of two banded matrices, is also a banded matrix with bandwidth of no more than 2\u03bd. It is well known that the Cholesky factor of a banded matrix is also banded, and the computation can be done in O(\u03bd3n) time. Suppose QZQTZ = RZ, then multiply (A T Z) \u22121QZ by a vector fp,0, which is standard multivariate normal distributed. It\u2019s not hard to show that (ATZ) \u22121QZfp,0 + \u00b5p \u223c N (\u00b5p,Kp,p). Hence, we obtain the samples which have same distribution with fp. In practical calculation, we may first compute the multiplication QZfp,0 then compute (ATZ) \u22121(QZfp,0) to reduce the time complexity since both AZ and QZ are banded matrices. The entire algorithm only costs O(\u03bd3n) time and O(\u03bdn) storage. A summary is given in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Sampling from one-dimensional GP priors. Input: Ordered input dataset Z defined in section 2.1 1: Compute banded matrices AZ and \u03d5(Z) with respect to the input data Z 2: Obtain a banded matrix; RZ := ATZ\u03d5(Z); 3: Apply Cholesky decomposition to RZ, get the lower triangular matrix QZ satisfying QZQTZ = RZ; 4: Generate samples fp,0 \u223c N (0, Ip); 5: Compute fkp := (ATZ) \u22121QZfp,0 + \u00b5p. Output: fkp Sampling from one-dimensional GP regression posteriors. This can be done by combining the KP technique with the Matheron\u2019s rule. The Matheron\u2019s rule was popularized by Journel & Huijbregts (1976) to geostatistics field. Recently Wilson et al. (2020) rediscovered and exploited it to develop a GP posterior sampling approach. The Matheron\u2019s rule is stated as follows. Let a and b be jointly Gaussian random vectors. Then the random vector a, conditional on b = \u03b2, is equal in distribution to (a|b = \u03b2) d= a+Cov(a,b)Cov(b,b)\u22121(\u03b2 \u2212 b), (10) where Cov(a,b) is the covariance of (a,b). By (10), the exact GP posteriors can be sampled by two jointly Gaussian random variables, and we obtain f\u2217|y d = f\u2217 +K\u2217,n [ Kn,n + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 In ]\u22121 (y \u2212 fn \u2212 \u03f5), (11) where f\u2217 and fn are jointly Gaussian random variables from the prior distribution, noise variates \u03f5 \u223c N (0, \u03c32\u03f5 In). Clearly, the joint distribution of (fn, f\u2217) follows the multivariate normal distribution as follows: (fn, f\u2217) \u223c N ([ \u00b5n \u00b5\u2217 ] , [ Kn,n Kn,\u2217 K\u2217,n K\u2217,\u2217 ]) . (12) We may apply KP to (11) and get the following corollary: f\u2217|y d = f\u2217 + \u03d5 T (X\u2217) [ \u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 AX ]\u22121 (y \u2212 fn \u2212 \u03f5). (13) Given that Algorithm 1 requires distinct and ordered data points, it\u2019s reasonable to assume training set X doesn\u2019t coincide with test set X\u2217. Also, we can rearrange the combined set of the training set X and test set X\u2217 to an ordered set and record the index of reordering. Next, we can utilize the Algorithm 1 to draw a reordered vector in Rn+m from the GP prior and obtain jointly samples fn and f\u2217 by recovering the reordered vector to the original sequence. Finally, we plug fn and f\u2217 into formula (13) to calculate the posterior samples. It\u2019s obvious the time complexity of this approach is also O(\u03bd3n) due to the sparsity of the matrices to be Cholesky decomposed and inverted. 3.2 SAMPLING FROM MULTI-DIMENSIONAL GPS: For multi-dimensional GPs, we suppose that the points X are given by a full grid, defined as XFG = \u00d7dj=1X(j), where each Xj is a set of one-dimensional data points, A \u00d7 B denotes the Cartesian product of sets A and B. Based on the separable structure defined in (4) and a full grid XFG, we can transform the multi-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem since the correlation matrix K(XFG,XFG) can be represented by Kronecker products (Henderson et al., 1983; Saatc\u0327i, 2012; Wilson & Nickisch, 2015) of matrices over each input dimension j: K(XFG,XFG) = d\u2297 j=1 Kj(X (j),X(j)). (14) Prior To sample from GP priors over a full grid design ZFG = \u00d7dj=1Z(j), it\u2019s easy to compute that tensor product \u2297d j=1 ( A\u2212T Z(j) QZ(j) ) is the Cholesky factor of the correlation matrix with a full grid ZFG. For each dimension j, we can generate matrices AZ(j) , \u03d5(Z(j)), and Cholesky factor QZ(j) with respect to one-dimensional dataset Z(j). To get the GP prior samplings over full grids, we need to apply the tensor product \u2297d j=1 ( A\u2212T Z(j) QZ(j) ) to fFGp,0 . More specifically, the samples from GP priors can be computed via fFGkp := d\u2297 j=1 ( A\u2212T Z(j) QZ(j) ) fFGp,0 + \u00b5 FG p \u223c N (\u00b5FGp ,K(ZFG,ZFG)). (15) Accordingly, on full grids, we only need to perform a for loop over dimensions, multiply banded matrices in each dimension, and calculate a tensor product. The total method is alsoO(\u03bd3n) because we are also dealing with sparse matrices. Posterior With regard to GP posteriors, it\u2019s impossible to employ the prior sampling scheme to draw jointly distributed samples (fFGn , f FG \u2217 ) since we cannot order a sequence of multi-dimensional data. We consider directly Cholesky factorizing the posterior correlation matrix KFG\u2217,\u2217|n to obtain CFG\u2217|n, then use (6) to generate samples. The calculation of posterior mean \u00b5 FG \u2217|n and posterior variance KFG\u2217,\u2217|n only costsO(\u03bd 3mn) time by using equations (25) and (26) in Appendix A.2. Therefore the time complexity of the entire scheme requires O(\u03bd3mn+m3). 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we will demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed sampling algorithm. We first generate samples from GP priors and posteriors with one-dimensional space in section 4.1 and two-dimensional full grid designs in section 4.2. Then we perform our approach to two real problems in section 4.3. For prior samplings, we use the random Fourier features (RFF) (Rahimi & Recht, 2007) and the Cholesky decomposition method as benchmarks. For posterior samplings, decoupled (Wilson et al., 2020) algorithm and the Cholesky decomposition method are used as benchmarks. We consider Mate\u0301rn correlations in (3) with lengthscale \u03c9 =\u221a 2\u03bd, smoothness \u03bd = 3/2 and 5/2. In two-dimensional problems, we choose \u201cseparable\u201d Mate\u0301rn correlations mentioned in Section 2.1 with the same correlations and same parameters \u03c9 = \u221a 2\u03bd in each dimension. We set the variance as \u03c32 = 1 for all experiments. All plots regarding \u03bd = 3/2 are given in the main article and these associated with \u03bd = 5/2 are deferred to Appendix A.3. 4.1 ONE-DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLES: Prior Sampling We generate one-dimensional prior samples on uniformly distributed points Z = {zi}pi=1 over interval [0, 10] with p = 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 1000. Left plots in Figure 1 and Figure 7 show the time taken in sampling schemes for different algorithms over the different number of points p, we can observe that KP algorithm costs much less than other algorithms for both Mate\u0301rn 3/2 and Mate\u0301rn 5/2 correlations especially when p = 5000, 10000. Also, the curves of Cholesky decomposition are incomplete due to the limit of storage. To test the accuracy, we select three subsets of size ten: {zi}10i=1, {zi}259i=250, {zi}500i=491 when p = 500 and compute the 2-Wasserstein distances between empirical priors and true distributions over these three subsets (called Cases 1-3 thereafter). The 2-Wasserstein distance measures the similarity of two distributions. Let f1 \u223c N (\u00b51,\u03a31) and f2 \u223c N (\u00b52,\u03a32), the 2-Wasserstein distance between the Gaussian distributions f1, f2 on L2 norm is given by (Dowson & Landau, 1982; Gelbrich, 1990; Mallasto & Feragen, 2017) W2(f1, f2) := ( ||\u00b51 \u2212 \u00b52||2 + tr ( \u03a31 +\u03a32 \u2212 2(\u03a3 1 2 1 \u03a32\u03a3 1 2 1 ) 1 2 )) 12 . (16) For the empirical distributions, the parameters are estimated from the replicated samples. From right plots in Figure 1 and Figure 7, we can observe that KP algorithm outperforms RFF and Cholesky method greatly in Case 1 and Case 3, which are boundary points of Z. Posterior Sampling We investigate the performance of sampling over m = 1000 test points on the one-dimensional test function, the shifted and dilated Gramacy & Lee function (Gramacy & Lee, 2012) f(x) = sin(2\u03c0x + 5\u03c0)/(0.4x + 1) + (0.2x \u2212 0.5)4 over the interval [0, 10] with n = 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 respectively given \u03c3\u03f5 = 10\u22123. Figure 2 and Figure 8 show the time cost of posterior GP sampling and Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the posterior samplings and the true function values with the above settings. It\u2019s clear that KP consumes less time to achieve better accuracy compared with decoupled approach and direct Cholesky decomposition method. The performance curves of Cholesky factorization in Figure 2 and Figure 8 in Appendix A.3 are incomplete, because the Cholesky decomposition function fails to work for such a huge sample size and gives a runtime error. 4.2 TWO-DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLES: Prior Sampling We generate prior samples over level-\u03b7 full grid design: ZFG\u03b7 = \u00d7dj=1{\u22125 + 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7,\u22125 + 2 \u00b7 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7, . . . , 5 \u2212 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7} with \u03b7 = 3, 4, 5, 6 and d = 2. Likewise, we use 2-Wasserstein distances defined in (16) to evaluate the accuracy of prior samplings in three cases, \u00d7dj=1{zi}3i=1, \u00d7dj=1{zi}17i=15,\u00d7dj=1{zi}31i=29 when {zi}31i=1 = {\u22125 + 10 \u00b7 2\u22125, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5 \u2212 10 \u00b7 2\u22125}. Left plots in Figure 3 and Figure 9 in Appendix A.3 show that KP takes less time than RFF and the Cholesky method especially for 212 gird points. Right plots in Figures 3 and Figure 9 show that KP has higher accuracy than RFF for both Mate\u0301rn 3/2 and 5/2 correlations but has lower accuracy than the Cholesky method for Mate\u0301rn 5/2 correlations. Posterior Sampling We choose the Griewank function (Griewank, 1981) f(x) = d\u2211 i=1 x2i 4000 + d\u220f i=1 cos( xi\u221a i ) + 1, x \u2208 (\u22125, 5)d as our test function and level-\u03b7 full grid design: XFG\u03b7 = \u00d7dj=1{\u22125+10\u00b72\u2212\u03b7,\u22125+2\u00b710\u00b72\u2212\u03b7, . . . , 5\u2212 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7} with \u03b7 = 3, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9 and d = 2 as our design of experiment. We then investigate the av- erage computational time and MSE over m = 1024 random test points for each sampling method. Figure 4 and Figure 10 in Appendix A.3 illustrate the performance of different sampling strategies, we can observe that both direct Cholesky decomposition and decoupled algorithm can only generate posterior samples from at most 212 observations due to the limit of storage, however, KP algorithm can sample from 218 observations because the space complexity of KP-based computation only requires O(\u03bdn). Although the accuracy of the KP method is lower than the direct Cholesky decomposition method and decoupled algorithm, it is still of high accuracy and the time cost is in a much shorter period of time compared with other algorithms. 4.3 APPLICATIONS: Thompson Sampling Thompson Sampling (TS) (Thompson, 1933) is a classical strategy for decision-making by selecting actions x \u2208 X that minimize a black-box function f : X \u2192 R. In round t, TS selects xt+1 \u2208 argminx\u2208X (f |y)(x), y is the observation set. Upon finding the minimizer, we may obtain yt+1 by evaluating at xt+1, and then add (xt+1, yt+1) to the training set. In this experiment, we consider a one-dimensional cut of the Ackley function (Ackley, 2012) f(x) = \u221220 exp{\u22120.2 \u00b7 \u221a 0.5 \u00b7 x2} \u2212 exp{\u22120.5(cos(2\u03c0x) + 1)}+ exp{1}+ 20. (17) The goal of this experiment is to find the global minimizer of function in (17). We start with k = 2\u03bd + 2 samples before the optimization, then at each round of TS, we draw a posterior sample f |y on 1000 uniformly distributed points over the interval [\u22125, 5] given the observation set. Next, we pick the smallest posterior sample at this round and add it to the training set, and repeat the above process. After some steps, we are able to get closer to the global minimum. In Figure 5, we compare the logarithm of total regret of different sampling algorithms, both the proposed approach (KP) and the decoupled method can find the global minimum within 15 rounds, which outperform the direct Cholesky factorization sampling scheme. Simulating Dynamical Systems Gaussian process posteriors are also commonly used in dynamical systems when we don\u2019t have sufficient data. Consider a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation x\u2032(s) = f(s, x(s)), (18) we can discretize the system\u2019s equation (18) to a difference equation in the following formula by Euler method (Butcher, 2016), yt = xt+1 \u2212 xt = \u03c4f(st, xt), (19) where \u03c4 is the fixed step size. We aim to simulate the state trajectories of this dynamical system. First, we set an initial point x0, then at iteration t, we draw a posterior GP sampling from the conditional distribution p(yt|Dt\u22121), where Dt\u22121 denotes the set of the data {(xi, yi)}ni=1 and the current trajectory {(xj , yj)}t\u22121j=1. In our implement, we choose the model as f(s, x(s)) = 0.5x \u2212 0.05x3 with step size \u03c4 = 0.25 and initial point x0 = \u22124.5. The training set was generated by evaluating (19) for n = 1000 points {xi}ni=1 uniformly from the interval [\u22125, 5]. Variations yt in each step were simulated by independent Mate\u0301rn 3/2 GPs with \u03c9 = \u221a 3. Figure 6 demonstrates the state trajectories of each algorithm for T = 480 steps, time cost in each iteration, and logarithm of MSE between xt obtained from GP-based simulations and xt obtained by directly performing the Euler method in (19) at each iteration t. The left plot in Figure 6 shows that the KP algorithm can accurately characterize state trajectories of this dynamical system. The middle and right plots in Figure 6 indicate that the KP algorithm takes much less time and yields high accuracy in each step. It achieves nearly the same performance as the decoupled method and outperforms the Cholesky decomposition method. 5 DISCUSSION: In this work, we propose a scalable and exact algorithm for one-dimensional Gaussian process sampling with Mate\u0301rn correlations for half-integer smoothness \u03bd, which only requires O(\u03bd3n) time and O(\u03bdn) space. The proposed method can be extended to some multi-dimensional problems such as noiseless full grid designs by using tensor product techniques. If the design is not grid-based, the proposed algorithm is not applicable, we may use the method in (Ding et al., 2020) to devise approximation algorithms for sampling. While the proposed method is theoretically exact and scalable algorithm, we observe some numerical stability issues in our experiments. This explains why sometimes the proposed method is not as accurate as the Cholesky decomposition method. Improvements and extensions of the proposed algorithm to overcome the stability issues and accommodate general multi-dimensional observations will be considered in a future work. A APPENDIX: A.1 CONSTRUCTION OF BANDED MATRICES IN (7) Intermediate KPs Let a = (a1, ..., ak)T be a vector with a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ak, then intermediate KPs are defined as \u03d5a(x) := k\u2211 j=1 AjK(x, aj) (20) and the coefficients Aj\u2019s can be obtained by solving the (k \u2212 1)\u00d7 k linear system k\u2211 j=1 Aja l j exp{\u03b4caj} = 0, (21) with l = 0, . . . , (k \u2212 3)/2 and \u03b4 = \u00b11. One-sided KPs As before, let a = (a1, ..., as)T be a vector with a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < as, one-sided KP is given by \u03d5a(x) := s\u2211 j=1 AjK(x, aj), (22) with (k + 1)/2 \u2264 s \u2264 k \u2212 1. For right-sided KPs, we can get coefficients Aj\u2019s by solving s\u2211 j=1 Aja l j exp{\u2212caj} = 0, s\u2211 j=1 Aja r j exp{caj} = 0, (23) where l = 0, . . . , (k \u2212 3)/2 and the second term of equation 23 comprises auxiliary equations for the case s \u2265 (k + 3)/2 with r = 0, . . . , s \u2212 (k + 3)/2. Similar to equation 21, equation 23 is an (s \u2212 1) \u00d7 s linear system. Left-sided KPs are constructed similarly by solving the following equations: s\u2211 j=1 Aja l j exp{caj} = 0, s\u2211 j=1 Aja r j exp{\u2212caj} = 0, (24) where l = 0, . . . , (k \u2212 3)/2 and the second term comprises auxiliary equations for the case s \u2265 (k + 3)/2 with r = 0, . . . , s\u2212 (k + 3)/2. KP Basis Let X = {xi}ni=1 be the one-dimensional input data satisfying x1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < xn, and K a Mate\u0301rn correlation function with a half-integer smoothness \u03bd. Suppose n \u2265 k := 2\u03bd + 2. We can construct the following n functions, as a subset of linear space K := span{K(\u00b7, xj)}nj=1: 1. \u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5(k\u22121)/2, defined as left-sided KPs \u03d5(x1,...,x(k+1)/2), \u03d5(x1,...,x(k+1)/2+1), . . . , \u03d5(x1,...,xk\u22121), 2. \u03d5(k+1)/2, \u03d5(k+1)/2+1, . . . , \u03d5n\u2212(k\u22121)/2, defined as KPs \u03d5(x1,...,xk), \u03d5(x2,...,xk+1), . . . , \u03d5(xn\u2212k+1,...,xn), 3. \u03d5n\u2212(k\u22123)/2, . . . , \u03d5n\u22121, \u03d5n, defined as right-sided KPs \u03d5(xn\u2212k+2,...,xn), . . . , \u03d5(xn\u2212(k\u22121)/2\u22121,...,xn), \u03d5(xn\u2212(k\u22121)/2,...,xn). Here functions {\u03d5j}nj=1 are linearly independent in K, together with the fact that the dimension of K is n, implies that {\u03d5j}nj=1 forms a basis for K, referred to as the KP basis. In equation 7, the (l, j)th entry of \u03d5(X) is \u03d5j(xl). In view of the compact supportedness of \u03d5j , \u03d5(X) is a banded matrix with bandwidth (k \u2212 3)/2: \u03d5(X) =  . . . . . . \u03d5j\u2212 k\u221232 (xj\u22122 k\u221232 ) . . . ... . . . \u03d5j\u2212 k\u221232 (xj) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03d5j+ k\u221232 (xj) . . . ... . . . \u03d5j+ k\u221232 (xj+2 k\u221232 ) . . . . . .  .

The paper title is: A Scalable and Exact Gaussian Process Sampler via Kernel Packets\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Gaussian processes (GPs) have been widely used in statistical and machine learning applications (Rasmussen, 2003; Cressie, 2015; Santner et al., 2003). The relevant areas and topics include regression (O\u2019Hagan, 1978; Bishop et al., 1995; Rasmussen, 2003; MacKay et al., 2003), classification (Kuss et al., 2005; Nickisch & Rasmussen, 2008; Hensman et al., 2015), Bayesian networks (Neal, 2012), optimization (Srinivas et al., 2009), and so on. GP modeling proceeds by imposing a GP as the prior of an underlying continuous function, which provides a flexible nonparametric framework for prediction and inference problems. When the sample size is large, the basic framework for GP regression suffers from the computational challenge of inverting large covariance matrices. A lot of work has been done to address this issue. Recent advances in scalable GP regression include Nystro\u0308m approximation (Quinonero-Candela & Rasmussen, 2005; Titsias, 2009; Hensman et al., 2013), random Fourier features (Rahimi & Recht, 2007), local approximation (Gramacy & Apley, 2015), structured kernel interpolation (Wilson & Nickisch, 2015), Vecchia approximation (Katzfuss & Guinness, 2021), sparse representation (Chen et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2021), etc. In this article, we focus on the sampling of random GP realizations. Such GPs can be either the prior stochastic processes, or the posterior processes in GP regression. Generating random sample paths of the GP prior or the posterior of the GP regression is crucial in machine learning areas such as Bayesian Optimization (Snoek et al., 2012; Frazier, 2018a;b), reinforcement learning (Kuss & Rasmussen, 2003; Engel et al., 2005; Grande et al., 2014), and inverse problems in uncertainty quantification (Murray-Smith & Pearlmutter, 2004; Marzouk & Najm, 2009; Teckentrup, 2020). To generate the function of a random GP sample, a common practice is to discretize the input space, and the problem becomes the sampling of a high-dimensional multivariate normal vector. Sampling high-dimensional multivariate normal vectors, however, is computationally challenging as well, as we need to factorize the large covariance matrices. The ideas of most scalable GP regression methods are not applicable to the sampling problem. Existing scalable sampling algorithms for GPs are scarce. A recent prominent work is done by Wilson et al. (2020). They proposed an efficient sampling approach called decoupled sampling by exploiting Matheron\u2019s rule and combining Nystro\u0308m approximation and random Fourier feature. They also generalized it to pathwise conditioning (Wilson et al., 2021) based on Matheron\u2019s update, which only needs the sampling from GP priors and is a powerful tool for both reasoning about and working with GPs. Motivated by those work, Maddox et al. (2021) extended Matheron\u2019s rule for multi-task GPs and applied it to Bayesian optimization; Nguyen et al. (2021) proposed the first use of such bounds to improve Gaussian process posterior sampling. It is worth noting that each of the above methods enforces a certain approximation scheme to facilitate rapid computation, i.e., none of these methods draws random samples from the theoretical Gaussian distributions exactly. In this paper, we propose algorithms of sampling from GP priors and GP regression posteriors exactly for one-dimension Mate\u0301rn kernel with half integer smoothness \u03bd, then we extend it to noiseless data in multi-dimension. We introduce the kernel packet (KP) (Chen et al., 2022) as a major tool for sampling and reduce the time complexity toO(\u03bd3n). This produces a linear-time exact sampler if \u03bd is not too large. Specifically, our work makes the following contributions: \u2022 We propose an exact sampling method for Gaussian processes with (product) Mate\u0301rn correlations on one-dimensional or multi-dimensional gird points. The computational time grows linearly in the size of the grid points. \u2022 We propose an exact and scalable sampler for the posterior Gaussian processes based on one-dimensional data or multi-dimensional data on full grid designs. \u2022 We demonstrate the value of the proposed algorithm in the Bayesian optimization and dynamical system problems. 2 BACKGROUND: This section covers the related background of the proposed method. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 introduce GPs, GP regression, and the basic method of GP sampling. In section 2.3, we review a newly introduced covariance matrix representation called the Kernel Packet (KP) (Chen et al., 2022), which will help expedite the GP sampling. 2.1 GPS AND GP REGRESSION: A GP is a stochastic process whose finite-dimensional distributions are multivariate normal. The probability law of a GP is uniquely determined by its mean function \u00b5(\u00b7) and covariance function K(\u00b7, \u00b7), and we denote this GP as GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). Let f : X \u2192 R be an unknown function, X \u2286 Rd. Suppose the training set consists of n Gaussian observations yi = f(xi) + \u03f5i with noise \u03f5i \u223c N (0, \u03c32\u03f5 ). In GP regression, we impose the prior f \u223c GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). Suppose that we have observed y = ( y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn )T on n distinct points X = {xi}ni=1. The posterior of f given the data is also a GP. Specifically, the posterior evaluation at m untried inputs X\u2217 = {x\u2217i }mi=1 follows f\u2217|y \u223c N (\u00b5\u2217|n,K\u2217,\u2217|n) with (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006): \u00b5\u2217|n = \u00b5\u2217 +K\u2217,n [ Kn,n + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 In ]\u22121 (y \u2212 \u00b5n) , (1) K\u2217,\u2217|n = \u03c3 2 ( K\u2217,\u2217 \u2212K\u2217,n [ Kn,n + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 In ]\u22121 Kn,\u2217 ) , (2) where \u03c32 > 0 is the variance of GP, In is a n \u00d7 n identity matrix, K\u2217,n = K(x\u2217,X) =( K(X,x\u2217) )T = KTn,\u2217 = ( K(x\u2217,x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K(x\u2217,xn) ) , Kn,n = [ K(xi,xs) ]n i,s=1 , K\u2217,\u2217 =[ K(x\u2217i ,x \u2217 s) ]m i,s=1 , \u00b5n = ( \u00b5(x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b5(xn) )T and \u00b5\u2217 = ( \u00b5(x\u22171), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b5(x\u2217m) )T . In this work, we focus on Mate\u0301rn correlation functions. One-dimensional Mate\u0301rn correlation functions (Stein, 1999) are defined as K(x, x\u2032) = 21\u2212\u03bd \u0393(\u03bd) (\u221a 2\u03bd |x\u2212 x\u2032| \u03c9 )\u03bd K\u03bd (\u221a 2\u03bd |x\u2212 x\u2032| \u03c9 ) , (3) for any x, x\u2032 \u2208 R, where \u03c32 > 0 is the variance, \u03bd > 0 is the smoothness parameter, \u03c9 > 0 is the lengthscale and K\u03bd is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. GPs with Mate\u0301rn correlations form a rich family with finite smoothness; their sample paths are \u2308\u03bd\u22121\u2309 times differentiable (Santner et al., 2003). By virtue of its flexibility, Mate\u0301rn family is deemed a popular choice of correlation functions in spatial statistics (Diggle et al., 2003), geostatistics (Curriero, 2006; Pardo-Iguzquiza & Chica-Olmo, 2008), image analysis (Zafari et al., 2020; Okhrin et al., 2020), and other applications. A common choice of multi-dimensional correlation structure is the \u201cseparable\u201d or \u201cproduct\u201d correlations, given by K(x,x\u2032) = d\u220f j=1 Kj(xj , x \u2032 j), (4) for any x,x\u2032 \u2208 Rd where Kj is the one-dimensional Mate\u0301rn correlation function for each j. The assumption of separability is used extensively in spatio-temporal statistics (Gneiting et al., 2006; Genton, 2007; Constantinou et al., 2017) because it allows for a simple construction of valid spacetime parametric models and facilitates the computational procedures for large datasets in inference and parameter estimation. 2.2 SAMPLING: The goal is to sample f(\u00b7) \u223c GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). To achieve a finite representation, we discretize the input space and consider the function values over a set of grid points Z = {zi}pi=1, and the objective is to generate samples fp = ( f(z1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , f(zp) )T from multivariate normal distribution N (\u00b5(Z),K(Z,Z)) = N (\u00b5p,Kp,p). The standard sampling method of a multivariate normal distribution is as follows: 1) generate a vector of samples fp,0 whose entries are independent and identically distributed normal, 2) employ the Cholesky decomposition (Golub & Van Loan, 2013) to factorize the covariance matrix Kp,p as CpCTp = Kp,p, 3) generate the output sample fp as fp \u2190 Cpfp,0 + \u00b5p. (5) Sampling a posterior GP can be done in a similar manner. Suppose we have observations y =( y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn )T on n distinct points X = {xi}ni=1, where yi = f(xi) + \u03f5i with noise \u03f5i \u223c N (0, \u03c32\u03f5 ) and f \u223c GP(\u00b5(\u00b7),K(\u00b7, \u00b7)). The goal is to generate posterior samples f\u2217|y at m test points X\u2217 = {x\u2217i }mi=1. Because the posterior samples f\u2217|y \u223c N (\u00b5\u2217|n,K\u2217,\u2217|n) are also multivariate normal distributed according to (1) and (2) in Section 2.1, we can do Cholesky decomposition C\u2217|nCT\u2217|n = K\u2217,\u2217|n, and generate GP posterior sample as f\u2217|y\u2190 C\u2217|nfn,0 + \u00b5\u2217|n, (6) where fn,0 \u223c N (0, In). 2.3 KERNEL PACKETS: In this section, we review the theory and methods of kernel packets by Chen et al. (2022). Suppose K(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a one-dimensional Mate\u0301rn kernel defined in (3), and one-dimensional input points X is ordered and distinct. Let K = span{K(\u00b7, xj)}nj=1. Then there exists a collection of linearly independent functions {\u03d5i}ni=1 \u2282 K, such that each \u03d5i = \u2211n j=1 A (i) j K(x, xj) has a compact support. Then covariance matrix Kn,n = K(X,X) is connected to a sparse matrix \u03d5(X) in the following way: Kn,nAX = \u03d5(X), (7) where both AX and \u03d5(X) are banded matrices, the (l, i)th entry of \u03d5(X) is \u03d5i(xl). The matrix AX consists of the coefficients to construct the KPs, and specifically, A (i) j is the (j, i) th entry of AX. In view of the sparse representation and the compact supportedness of \u03d5j , the bandwidth of AX is (k\u2212 1)/2, the bandwidth of \u03d5(X) is (k\u2212 3)/2, k := 2\u03bd + 2, \u03bd is the smoothness parameter in (3). We defer the detailed algorithm to establish the factorization (7) to Appendix A.1. Here we only emphasize that the algorithm to find AX and \u03d5(X) takes only O(\u03bd3n) operations and O(\u03bdn) storage. Based on (7), we can substitute AX and \u03d5(\u00b7) for K(\u00b7,X) in (1), (2) and rewrite the equations as follows: \u00b5\u2217|n = \u00b5\u2217 + \u03d5 T (X\u2217) [ \u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 AX ]\u22121 (y \u2212 \u00b5n) , (8) K\u2217,\u2217|n = \u03c3 2 ( K\u2217,\u2217 \u2212 \u03d5T (X\u2217) [ ATX\u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 ATXAX ]\u22121 \u03d5(X\u2217) ) , (9) Because \u03d5(X) and AX are both banded matrices, the summations \u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32AX and \u03c3 2\u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5AX are also banded matrices. Therefore, the time complexity of matrix inversion via KPs is only O(\u03bd3n). 3 SAMPLING WITH KERNEL PACKETS: In this section, we present the main algorithms for sampling from Gaussian process priors and posteriors based on the KP technique. We introduce the algorithms of sampling from one-dimensional GP and multi-dimensional GP respectively in sections 3.1 and 3.2. 3.1 SAMPLING FROM ONE-DIMENSIONAL GPS: Consider one-dimensional GPs with Mate\u0301rn correlations for half integer smoothness \u03bd. Sampling from the prior distribution For a set of grid points Z = {zi}pi=1, we first compute the sparse matrices AZ and \u03d5(Z) in (7). Now, instead of a direct Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix Kp,p = K(Z,Z), we consider the Cholesky decomposition of the symmetric positive definite matrix RZ := ATZ\u03d5(Z). This shifting makes a significant difference: Kp,p is a dense matrix, and the Cholesky decomposition takes O(n3) time. In contrast, RZ, as a multiplication of two banded matrices, is also a banded matrix with bandwidth of no more than 2\u03bd. It is well known that the Cholesky factor of a banded matrix is also banded, and the computation can be done in O(\u03bd3n) time. Suppose QZQTZ = RZ, then multiply (A T Z) \u22121QZ by a vector fp,0, which is standard multivariate normal distributed. It\u2019s not hard to show that (ATZ) \u22121QZfp,0 + \u00b5p \u223c N (\u00b5p,Kp,p). Hence, we obtain the samples which have same distribution with fp. In practical calculation, we may first compute the multiplication QZfp,0 then compute (ATZ) \u22121(QZfp,0) to reduce the time complexity since both AZ and QZ are banded matrices. The entire algorithm only costs O(\u03bd3n) time and O(\u03bdn) storage. A summary is given in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Sampling from one-dimensional GP priors. Input: Ordered input dataset Z defined in section 2.1 1: Compute banded matrices AZ and \u03d5(Z) with respect to the input data Z 2: Obtain a banded matrix; RZ := ATZ\u03d5(Z); 3: Apply Cholesky decomposition to RZ, get the lower triangular matrix QZ satisfying QZQTZ = RZ; 4: Generate samples fp,0 \u223c N (0, Ip); 5: Compute fkp := (ATZ) \u22121QZfp,0 + \u00b5p. Output: fkp Sampling from one-dimensional GP regression posteriors. This can be done by combining the KP technique with the Matheron\u2019s rule. The Matheron\u2019s rule was popularized by Journel & Huijbregts (1976) to geostatistics field. Recently Wilson et al. (2020) rediscovered and exploited it to develop a GP posterior sampling approach. The Matheron\u2019s rule is stated as follows. Let a and b be jointly Gaussian random vectors. Then the random vector a, conditional on b = \u03b2, is equal in distribution to (a|b = \u03b2) d= a+Cov(a,b)Cov(b,b)\u22121(\u03b2 \u2212 b), (10) where Cov(a,b) is the covariance of (a,b). By (10), the exact GP posteriors can be sampled by two jointly Gaussian random variables, and we obtain f\u2217|y d = f\u2217 +K\u2217,n [ Kn,n + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 In ]\u22121 (y \u2212 fn \u2212 \u03f5), (11) where f\u2217 and fn are jointly Gaussian random variables from the prior distribution, noise variates \u03f5 \u223c N (0, \u03c32\u03f5 In). Clearly, the joint distribution of (fn, f\u2217) follows the multivariate normal distribution as follows: (fn, f\u2217) \u223c N ([ \u00b5n \u00b5\u2217 ] , [ Kn,n Kn,\u2217 K\u2217,n K\u2217,\u2217 ]) . (12) We may apply KP to (11) and get the following corollary: f\u2217|y d = f\u2217 + \u03d5 T (X\u2217) [ \u03d5(X) + \u03c32\u03f5 \u03c32 AX ]\u22121 (y \u2212 fn \u2212 \u03f5). (13) Given that Algorithm 1 requires distinct and ordered data points, it\u2019s reasonable to assume training set X doesn\u2019t coincide with test set X\u2217. Also, we can rearrange the combined set of the training set X and test set X\u2217 to an ordered set and record the index of reordering. Next, we can utilize the Algorithm 1 to draw a reordered vector in Rn+m from the GP prior and obtain jointly samples fn and f\u2217 by recovering the reordered vector to the original sequence. Finally, we plug fn and f\u2217 into formula (13) to calculate the posterior samples. It\u2019s obvious the time complexity of this approach is also O(\u03bd3n) due to the sparsity of the matrices to be Cholesky decomposed and inverted. 3.2 SAMPLING FROM MULTI-DIMENSIONAL GPS: For multi-dimensional GPs, we suppose that the points X are given by a full grid, defined as XFG = \u00d7dj=1X(j), where each Xj is a set of one-dimensional data points, A \u00d7 B denotes the Cartesian product of sets A and B. Based on the separable structure defined in (4) and a full grid XFG, we can transform the multi-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem since the correlation matrix K(XFG,XFG) can be represented by Kronecker products (Henderson et al., 1983; Saatc\u0327i, 2012; Wilson & Nickisch, 2015) of matrices over each input dimension j: K(XFG,XFG) = d\u2297 j=1 Kj(X (j),X(j)). (14) Prior To sample from GP priors over a full grid design ZFG = \u00d7dj=1Z(j), it\u2019s easy to compute that tensor product \u2297d j=1 ( A\u2212T Z(j) QZ(j) ) is the Cholesky factor of the correlation matrix with a full grid ZFG. For each dimension j, we can generate matrices AZ(j) , \u03d5(Z(j)), and Cholesky factor QZ(j) with respect to one-dimensional dataset Z(j). To get the GP prior samplings over full grids, we need to apply the tensor product \u2297d j=1 ( A\u2212T Z(j) QZ(j) ) to fFGp,0 . More specifically, the samples from GP priors can be computed via fFGkp := d\u2297 j=1 ( A\u2212T Z(j) QZ(j) ) fFGp,0 + \u00b5 FG p \u223c N (\u00b5FGp ,K(ZFG,ZFG)). (15) Accordingly, on full grids, we only need to perform a for loop over dimensions, multiply banded matrices in each dimension, and calculate a tensor product. The total method is alsoO(\u03bd3n) because we are also dealing with sparse matrices. Posterior With regard to GP posteriors, it\u2019s impossible to employ the prior sampling scheme to draw jointly distributed samples (fFGn , f FG \u2217 ) since we cannot order a sequence of multi-dimensional data. We consider directly Cholesky factorizing the posterior correlation matrix KFG\u2217,\u2217|n to obtain CFG\u2217|n, then use (6) to generate samples. The calculation of posterior mean \u00b5 FG \u2217|n and posterior variance KFG\u2217,\u2217|n only costsO(\u03bd 3mn) time by using equations (25) and (26) in Appendix A.2. Therefore the time complexity of the entire scheme requires O(\u03bd3mn+m3). 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we will demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed sampling algorithm. We first generate samples from GP priors and posteriors with one-dimensional space in section 4.1 and two-dimensional full grid designs in section 4.2. Then we perform our approach to two real problems in section 4.3. For prior samplings, we use the random Fourier features (RFF) (Rahimi & Recht, 2007) and the Cholesky decomposition method as benchmarks. For posterior samplings, decoupled (Wilson et al., 2020) algorithm and the Cholesky decomposition method are used as benchmarks. We consider Mate\u0301rn correlations in (3) with lengthscale \u03c9 =\u221a 2\u03bd, smoothness \u03bd = 3/2 and 5/2. In two-dimensional problems, we choose \u201cseparable\u201d Mate\u0301rn correlations mentioned in Section 2.1 with the same correlations and same parameters \u03c9 = \u221a 2\u03bd in each dimension. We set the variance as \u03c32 = 1 for all experiments. All plots regarding \u03bd = 3/2 are given in the main article and these associated with \u03bd = 5/2 are deferred to Appendix A.3. 4.1 ONE-DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLES: Prior Sampling We generate one-dimensional prior samples on uniformly distributed points Z = {zi}pi=1 over interval [0, 10] with p = 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 1000. Left plots in Figure 1 and Figure 7 show the time taken in sampling schemes for different algorithms over the different number of points p, we can observe that KP algorithm costs much less than other algorithms for both Mate\u0301rn 3/2 and Mate\u0301rn 5/2 correlations especially when p = 5000, 10000. Also, the curves of Cholesky decomposition are incomplete due to the limit of storage. To test the accuracy, we select three subsets of size ten: {zi}10i=1, {zi}259i=250, {zi}500i=491 when p = 500 and compute the 2-Wasserstein distances between empirical priors and true distributions over these three subsets (called Cases 1-3 thereafter). The 2-Wasserstein distance measures the similarity of two distributions. Let f1 \u223c N (\u00b51,\u03a31) and f2 \u223c N (\u00b52,\u03a32), the 2-Wasserstein distance between the Gaussian distributions f1, f2 on L2 norm is given by (Dowson & Landau, 1982; Gelbrich, 1990; Mallasto & Feragen, 2017) W2(f1, f2) := ( ||\u00b51 \u2212 \u00b52||2 + tr ( \u03a31 +\u03a32 \u2212 2(\u03a3 1 2 1 \u03a32\u03a3 1 2 1 ) 1 2 )) 12 . (16) For the empirical distributions, the parameters are estimated from the replicated samples. From right plots in Figure 1 and Figure 7, we can observe that KP algorithm outperforms RFF and Cholesky method greatly in Case 1 and Case 3, which are boundary points of Z. Posterior Sampling We investigate the performance of sampling over m = 1000 test points on the one-dimensional test function, the shifted and dilated Gramacy & Lee function (Gramacy & Lee, 2012) f(x) = sin(2\u03c0x + 5\u03c0)/(0.4x + 1) + (0.2x \u2212 0.5)4 over the interval [0, 10] with n = 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 respectively given \u03c3\u03f5 = 10\u22123. Figure 2 and Figure 8 show the time cost of posterior GP sampling and Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the posterior samplings and the true function values with the above settings. It\u2019s clear that KP consumes less time to achieve better accuracy compared with decoupled approach and direct Cholesky decomposition method. The performance curves of Cholesky factorization in Figure 2 and Figure 8 in Appendix A.3 are incomplete, because the Cholesky decomposition function fails to work for such a huge sample size and gives a runtime error. 4.2 TWO-DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLES: Prior Sampling We generate prior samples over level-\u03b7 full grid design: ZFG\u03b7 = \u00d7dj=1{\u22125 + 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7,\u22125 + 2 \u00b7 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7, . . . , 5 \u2212 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7} with \u03b7 = 3, 4, 5, 6 and d = 2. Likewise, we use 2-Wasserstein distances defined in (16) to evaluate the accuracy of prior samplings in three cases, \u00d7dj=1{zi}3i=1, \u00d7dj=1{zi}17i=15,\u00d7dj=1{zi}31i=29 when {zi}31i=1 = {\u22125 + 10 \u00b7 2\u22125, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5 \u2212 10 \u00b7 2\u22125}. Left plots in Figure 3 and Figure 9 in Appendix A.3 show that KP takes less time than RFF and the Cholesky method especially for 212 gird points. Right plots in Figures 3 and Figure 9 show that KP has higher accuracy than RFF for both Mate\u0301rn 3/2 and 5/2 correlations but has lower accuracy than the Cholesky method for Mate\u0301rn 5/2 correlations. Posterior Sampling We choose the Griewank function (Griewank, 1981) f(x) = d\u2211 i=1 x2i 4000 + d\u220f i=1 cos( xi\u221a i ) + 1, x \u2208 (\u22125, 5)d as our test function and level-\u03b7 full grid design: XFG\u03b7 = \u00d7dj=1{\u22125+10\u00b72\u2212\u03b7,\u22125+2\u00b710\u00b72\u2212\u03b7, . . . , 5\u2212 10 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b7} with \u03b7 = 3, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9 and d = 2 as our design of experiment. We then investigate the av- erage computational time and MSE over m = 1024 random test points for each sampling method. Figure 4 and Figure 10 in Appendix A.3 illustrate the performance of different sampling strategies, we can observe that both direct Cholesky decomposition and decoupled algorithm can only generate posterior samples from at most 212 observations due to the limit of storage, however, KP algorithm can sample from 218 observations because the space complexity of KP-based computation only requires O(\u03bdn). Although the accuracy of the KP method is lower than the direct Cholesky decomposition method and decoupled algorithm, it is still of high accuracy and the time cost is in a much shorter period of time compared with other algorithms. 4.3 APPLICATIONS: Thompson Sampling Thompson Sampling (TS) (Thompson, 1933) is a classical strategy for decision-making by selecting actions x \u2208 X that minimize a black-box function f : X \u2192 R. In round t, TS selects xt+1 \u2208 argminx\u2208X (f |y)(x), y is the observation set. Upon finding the minimizer, we may obtain yt+1 by evaluating at xt+1, and then add (xt+1, yt+1) to the training set. In this experiment, we consider a one-dimensional cut of the Ackley function (Ackley, 2012) f(x) = \u221220 exp{\u22120.2 \u00b7 \u221a 0.5 \u00b7 x2} \u2212 exp{\u22120.5(cos(2\u03c0x) + 1)}+ exp{1}+ 20. (17) The goal of this experiment is to find the global minimizer of function in (17). We start with k = 2\u03bd + 2 samples before the optimization, then at each round of TS, we draw a posterior sample f |y on 1000 uniformly distributed points over the interval [\u22125, 5] given the observation set. Next, we pick the smallest posterior sample at this round and add it to the training set, and repeat the above process. After some steps, we are able to get closer to the global minimum. In Figure 5, we compare the logarithm of total regret of different sampling algorithms, both the proposed approach (KP) and the decoupled method can find the global minimum within 15 rounds, which outperform the direct Cholesky factorization sampling scheme. Simulating Dynamical Systems Gaussian process posteriors are also commonly used in dynamical systems when we don\u2019t have sufficient data. Consider a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation x\u2032(s) = f(s, x(s)), (18) we can discretize the system\u2019s equation (18) to a difference equation in the following formula by Euler method (Butcher, 2016), yt = xt+1 \u2212 xt = \u03c4f(st, xt), (19) where \u03c4 is the fixed step size. We aim to simulate the state trajectories of this dynamical system. First, we set an initial point x0, then at iteration t, we draw a posterior GP sampling from the conditional distribution p(yt|Dt\u22121), where Dt\u22121 denotes the set of the data {(xi, yi)}ni=1 and the current trajectory {(xj , yj)}t\u22121j=1. In our implement, we choose the model as f(s, x(s)) = 0.5x \u2212 0.05x3 with step size \u03c4 = 0.25 and initial point x0 = \u22124.5. The training set was generated by evaluating (19) for n = 1000 points {xi}ni=1 uniformly from the interval [\u22125, 5]. Variations yt in each step were simulated by independent Mate\u0301rn 3/2 GPs with \u03c9 = \u221a 3. Figure 6 demonstrates the state trajectories of each algorithm for T = 480 steps, time cost in each iteration, and logarithm of MSE between xt obtained from GP-based simulations and xt obtained by directly performing the Euler method in (19) at each iteration t. The left plot in Figure 6 shows that the KP algorithm can accurately characterize state trajectories of this dynamical system. The middle and right plots in Figure 6 indicate that the KP algorithm takes much less time and yields high accuracy in each step. It achieves nearly the same performance as the decoupled method and outperforms the Cholesky decomposition method. 5 DISCUSSION: In this work, we propose a scalable and exact algorithm for one-dimensional Gaussian process sampling with Mate\u0301rn correlations for half-integer smoothness \u03bd, which only requires O(\u03bd3n) time and O(\u03bdn) space. The proposed method can be extended to some multi-dimensional problems such as noiseless full grid designs by using tensor product techniques. If the design is not grid-based, the proposed algorithm is not applicable, we may use the method in (Ding et al., 2020) to devise approximation algorithms for sampling. While the proposed method is theoretically exact and scalable algorithm, we observe some numerical stability issues in our experiments. This explains why sometimes the proposed method is not as accurate as the Cholesky decomposition method. Improvements and extensions of the proposed algorithm to overcome the stability issues and accommodate general multi-dimensional observations will be considered in a future work. A APPENDIX: A.1 CONSTRUCTION OF BANDED MATRICES IN (7) Intermediate KPs Let a = (a1, ..., ak)T be a vector with a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ak, then intermediate KPs are defined as \u03d5a(x) := k\u2211 j=1 AjK(x, aj) (20) and the coefficients Aj\u2019s can be obtained by solving the (k \u2212 1)\u00d7 k linear system k\u2211 j=1 Aja l j exp{\u03b4caj} = 0, (21) with l = 0, . . . , (k \u2212 3)/2 and \u03b4 = \u00b11. One-sided KPs As before, let a = (a1, ..., as)T be a vector with a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < as, one-sided KP is given by \u03d5a(x) := s\u2211 j=1 AjK(x, aj), (22) with (k + 1)/2 \u2264 s \u2264 k \u2212 1. For right-sided KPs, we can get coefficients Aj\u2019s by solving s\u2211 j=1 Aja l j exp{\u2212caj} = 0, s\u2211 j=1 Aja r j exp{caj} = 0, (23) where l = 0, . . . , (k \u2212 3)/2 and the second term of equation 23 comprises auxiliary equations for the case s \u2265 (k + 3)/2 with r = 0, . . . , s \u2212 (k + 3)/2. Similar to equation 21, equation 23 is an (s \u2212 1) \u00d7 s linear system. Left-sided KPs are constructed similarly by solving the following equations: s\u2211 j=1 Aja l j exp{caj} = 0, s\u2211 j=1 Aja r j exp{\u2212caj} = 0, (24) where l = 0, . . . , (k \u2212 3)/2 and the second term comprises auxiliary equations for the case s \u2265 (k + 3)/2 with r = 0, . . . , s\u2212 (k + 3)/2. KP Basis Let X = {xi}ni=1 be the one-dimensional input data satisfying x1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < xn, and K a Mate\u0301rn correlation function with a half-integer smoothness \u03bd. Suppose n \u2265 k := 2\u03bd + 2. We can construct the following n functions, as a subset of linear space K := span{K(\u00b7, xj)}nj=1: 1. \u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5(k\u22121)/2, defined as left-sided KPs \u03d5(x1,...,x(k+1)/2), \u03d5(x1,...,x(k+1)/2+1), . . . , \u03d5(x1,...,xk\u22121), 2. \u03d5(k+1)/2, \u03d5(k+1)/2+1, . . . , \u03d5n\u2212(k\u22121)/2, defined as KPs \u03d5(x1,...,xk), \u03d5(x2,...,xk+1), . . . , \u03d5(xn\u2212k+1,...,xn), 3. \u03d5n\u2212(k\u22123)/2, . . . , \u03d5n\u22121, \u03d5n, defined as right-sided KPs \u03d5(xn\u2212k+2,...,xn), . . . , \u03d5(xn\u2212(k\u22121)/2\u22121,...,xn), \u03d5(xn\u2212(k\u22121)/2,...,xn). Here functions {\u03d5j}nj=1 are linearly independent in K, together with the fact that the dimension of K is n, implies that {\u03d5j}nj=1 forms a basis for K, referred to as the KP basis. In equation 7, the (l, j)th entry of \u03d5(X) is \u03d5j(xl). In view of the compact supportedness of \u03d5j , \u03d5(X) is a banded matrix with bandwidth (k \u2212 3)/2: \u03d5(X) =  . . . . . . \u03d5j\u2212 k\u221232 (xj\u22122 k\u221232 ) . . . ... . . . \u03d5j\u2212 k\u221232 (xj) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03d5j+ k\u221232 (xj) . . . ... . . . \u03d5j+ k\u221232 (xj+2 k\u221232 ) . . . . . .  .

Gaussian random variables. The covariance function would then be approximated as $K(x, x') \\\\approx \\\\sum_{m=1}^M \\\\phi_m(x) \\\\phi_m(x')$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of Kernel Packet Based Sampling Algorithm\\n\\n#### 1. Correctness\\n\\nThe fundamental correctness of this approach relies on the principle of Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve (K-L) expansion, or more generally, on low-rank approximations of covariance operators.\\n\\n*   **Underlying Principle:** Any continuous Gaussian Process with a square-integrable covariance function can be represented by a K-L expansion: $f(x) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_j} \\\\psi_j(x) z_j$, where $\\\\lambda_j$ and $\\\\psi_j(x)$ are eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the covariance operator, and $z_j \\\\sim N(0,1)$. Truncating this infinite sum to $M$ terms provides the best possible low-rank approximation in an $L^2$ sense for a given $M$.\\n*   **Kernel Packet Interpretation:** If the \\\"Kernel Packets\\\" $\\\\phi_m(x)$ are effectively chosen as approximations or surrogates for the eigenfunctions $\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_j} \\\\psi_j(x)$ (or some other form of orthogonal basis that well-approximates the kernel), then the method is correct in principle for generating samples from an *approximation* of the GP.\\n*   **Key Questions for Correctness:**\\n    1.  **How are the $\\\\phi_m(x)$ constructed?** This is paramount. Are they pre-defined (e.g., wavelets, splines, Gaussian bumps), or are they learned from the kernel (e.g., via a decomposition or optimization)?\\n    2.  **Approximation Quality:** Does the sum $\\\\sum_{m=1}^M \\\\phi_m(x) \\\\phi_m(x')$ accurately approximate the true kernel $K(x, x')$? Is there a theoretical bound on the approximation error as a function of $M$?\\n    3.  **Positive Definiteness:** Is the approximated kernel $\\\\hat{K}(x, x') = \\\\sum_{m=1}^M \\\\phi_m(x) \\\\phi_m(x')$ guaranteed to be positive semi-definite? This is generally true by construction if the form is $\\\\Phi \\\\Phi^T$.\\n    4.  **Sampling Fidelity:** The sampling scheme $f(x) = \\\\sum_{m=1}^M \\\\phi_m(x) z_m$ is correct *given* the approximate kernel. The concern is how well this approximate kernel represents the *true* GP's properties (smoothness, amplitude, length-scales) across the domain, especially when $M$ is small.\\n\\n*   **Verdict on Correctness:** The *sampling mechanism* itself (summing basis functions multiplied by random normal variables) is correct *for the approximated kernel*. The correctness hinges entirely on the *validity and quality of the kernel packet approximation* to the true kernel. Without a detailed construction of $\\\\phi_m(x)$ and theoretical guarantees on the approximation error, its overall correctness for *general GP sampling* cannot be fully assured.\\n\\n#### 2. Novelty\\n\\nThe concept of representing GPs or their kernels via basis function expansions is not new. It underlies many established methods:\\n\\n*   **Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve Expansion:** As mentioned, this is the optimal theoretical basis. Practical methods often try to approximate it.\\n*   **Basis Function Models for GPs:** Many sparse GP approximations use basis functions (e.g., fixed basis functions like wavelets, B-splines, radial basis functions, or learned basis functions in variational methods like the \\\"fully independent conditional\\\" (FIC) approximation).\\n*   **Random Fourier Features (RFF):** RFF approximates the kernel $K(x, x')$ via Bochner's theorem as an expectation over spectral frequencies. Practical RFF approximates this integral using Monte Carlo samples: $K(x,x') \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{M_{RFF}} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{M_{RFF}} \\\\cos(\\\\omega_j^T x + b_j) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_j^T x' + b_j)$. This is exactly of the form $\\\\sum \\\\phi_j(x)\\\\phi_j(x')$ where $\\\\phi_j(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{M_{RFF}}} \\\\cos(\\\\omega_j^T x + b_j)$.\\n*   **Decoupled Sampling Methods:** These often rely on inducing points to create a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix, allowing for $O(NM)$ or $O(M^2 N)$ sampling, where $M$ is the number of inducing points. The underlying approximation is often of the form $K \\\\approx K_{NM} K_{MM}^{-1} K_{MN}$.\\n\\n**Where Novelty Could Lie:**\\n\\nThe novelty of \\\"Kernel Packets\\\" would depend critically on:\\n\\n1.  **Specific Construction of $\\\\phi_m(x)$:** Are these packets fundamentally different from existing basis functions (e.g., Fourier features, wavelets, compactly supported radial basis functions)?\\n    *   If they are *learned* or *optimized* in a novel way that yields better approximation quality for a given $M$ than RFF or fixed basis functions.\\n    *   If they are designed to intrinsically capture certain kernel properties (e.g., non-stationarity, periodicity, multi-scale features) more effectively than other methods.\\n    *   If they offer specific theoretical guarantees (e.g., faster decay of approximation error) that are not present in prior art.\\n2.  **Computational Efficiency of Construction:** Is the process of finding these $\\\\phi_m(x)$ (the setup phase) significantly more efficient than, say, computing exact K-L expansions or optimizing variational parameters?\\n3.  **Application Domain/Kernel Type:** Does it offer particular advantages for a specific class of kernels (e.g., Mat\u00e9rn, periodic, composite) or in high-dimensional settings where other methods struggle?\\n\\n**Verdict on Novelty:** Without specific details on the construction of the Kernel Packets, it's hard to definitively state novelty. If it's merely using existing basis functions (like a direct application of wavelet transforms or specific splines), the novelty is low. If it introduces a *new principled way* to construct these \\\"packets\\\" or a novel theoretical connection that leads to superior performance/guarantees, then the novelty is high. The paper must clearly articulate how its $\\\\phi_m(x)$ differ from and improve upon the $\\\\phi_j(x)$ used in RFF or other basis function approaches.\\n\\n#### 3. Time Complexity Analysis\\n\\nLet $N$ be the number of points at which the GP sample is desired, and $M$ be the number of Kernel Packets used.\\n\\n*   **Setup Phase (Construction of $\\\\phi_m(x)$):** This is the most crucial part and often overlooked in simple analyses.\\n    *   **If $\\\\phi_m(x)$ are pre-defined:** (e.g., fixed wavelets on a grid), the setup cost is often negligible or pre-computed.\\n    *   **If $\\\\phi_m(x)$ are learned/optimized:** This phase can be computationally intensive.\\n        *   If it involves eigenvalue decomposition of a dense $N \\\\times N$ kernel matrix (like exact K-L), it's $O(N^3)$.\\n        *   If it involves approximation/optimization over $M$ features, it could be $O(M^3)$ or $O(M^2 N)$ or some other complexity depending on the method (e.g., Nystrom approximation $O(M^2 N)$, sparse Cholesky $O(NM^2)$).\\n        *   A truly novel method would aim for a setup cost that scales sub-quadratically with $N$, ideally $O(M^p)$ or $O(N \\\\log N)$ or similar.\\n    *   **Scaling with Dimensionality (D):** For many basis function methods, $M$ scales exponentially with $D$ (the curse of dimensionality) to maintain accuracy. This makes $O(M)$ or $O(NM)$ methods impractical in high dimensions unless $M$ is fixed to a small constant, leading to poor accuracy.\\n\\n*   **Sampling Phase (Generating $f(x)$ at $N$ points):**\\n    1.  **Generate $M$ i.i.d. $N(0,1)$ variables:** $O(M)$.\\n    2.  **Evaluate $\\\\phi_m(x)$ for all $m$ and all $N$ points:** This involves $M \\\\times N$ evaluations. If each $\\\\phi_m(x)$ evaluation takes $O(1)$ time, this is $O(NM)$.\\n    3.  **Summing:** This is also $O(NM)$.\\n\\n*   **Total Time Complexity:** **Setup Cost + $O(NM)$** for sampling.\\n\\n*   **Comparison to Existing Methods:**\\n    *   **Cholesky Decomposition (Exact):** $O(N^3)$ setup, $O(N^2)$ for a single sample. Much slower than $O(NM)$ if $M \\\\ll N$.\\n    *   **Random Fourier Features (RFF):** $O(M_{RFF})$ setup (sampling frequencies), $O(NM_{RFF})$ sampling. This is highly competitive. For the \\\"Kernel Packet\\\" method to be superior, it must achieve comparable or better accuracy for a significantly smaller $M$ compared to $M_{RFF}$, or have a substantially lower setup cost if $M_{RFF}$ selection involves more computation.\\n    *   **Decoupled/Sparse GP Methods:** Often $O(NM)$ or $O(NM^2)$ for prediction/sampling, with setup costs similar to RFF for some variational methods (e.g., $O(NM^2)$ for learning inducing points if $M$ inducing points are chosen among $N$ data points).\\n\\n*   **Verdict on Time Complexity:** The $O(NM)$ sampling phase is efficient, aligning with other state-of-the-art approximation methods like RFF. The *critical factor* for the overall efficiency and practical utility is the **setup cost** of the Kernel Packets ($\\\\phi_m(x)$) and how $M$ scales with desired accuracy, $N$, and dimensionality $D$. The paper needs to provide a detailed analysis of this setup cost and its dependencies. If the setup cost is high (e.g., $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^2)$), the method is only useful if many samples are needed from the same GP prior/posterior.\\n\\n#### 4. Validity of Assumptions\\n\\n*   **Stationary Kernel:** Many basis function methods (especially those leveraging spectral properties) implicitly or explicitly assume stationary kernels. If the Kernel Packets are constructed using spectral density properties (like RFF), then stationarity is a key assumption. If they are constructed adaptively (e.g., based on local kernel properties), they might generalize to non-stationary kernels. The paper must clarify this.\\n*   **Bounded Domain:** Basis function expansions often perform best on compact domains (e.g., $[0,1]^D$). If the domain is unbounded, the choice and effectiveness of basis functions become more challenging. If the packets are specifically designed for bounded domains, this needs to be stated as a limitation.\\n*   **Smoothness of Kernel:** The number of basis functions $M$ required for a certain approximation error typically depends on the smoothness of the kernel. Smoother kernels generally require fewer basis functions. The paper should discuss this relationship.\\n*   **Low-Dimensional Data:** As highlighted in the complexity analysis, many basis function approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where $M$ grows exponentially with the input dimension $D$. If the method is primarily for low-dimensional data, this should be an explicit assumption or limitation. If it mitigates the curse of dimensionality, this is a major strength and needs a detailed explanation.\\n*   **Computational Resources for Setup:** Implicitly assumes sufficient memory and time for the setup phase, which might be demanding depending on the chosen method for constructing $\\\\phi_m(x)$.\\n\\n**Verdict on Assumptions:** The paper must clearly state and justify its assumptions regarding kernel type, domain, data dimensionality, and the computational feasibility of the setup phase. Unstated assumptions are a major weakness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n1.  **Potentially Fast Sampling:** Once the Kernel Packets are computed, generating samples is $O(NM)$, which is significantly faster than exact Cholesky decomposition for large $N$.\\n2.  **Memory Efficient:** For large $N$, storing the $M$ basis functions is $O(NM_{val})$ (where $M_{val}$ is the number of values to describe $\\\\phi_m$) rather than $O(N^2)$ for the full covariance matrix.\\n3.  **Parallelizable:** The evaluation of $\\\\phi_m(x)$ and the final summation can be highly parallelized across $N$ points and $M$ packets.\\n4.  **Flexibility (Potential):** Depending on their construction, Kernel Packets might offer more flexibility than fixed basis functions (like in standard RFF) in adapting to specific kernel structures, non-stationarity, or multi-scale phenomena.\\n\\n### Weaknesses\\n\\n1.  **Setup Cost is Critical:** The main bottleneck is likely the initial computation or optimization of the Kernel Packets. If this cost is high or scales poorly with $N$ or $D$, the benefits of fast sampling are diminished for single-sample scenarios.\\n2.  **Approximation Error:** The samples are from an approximation of the GP, not the exact GP. The paper must quantify this error and demonstrate that $M$ can be chosen small enough for practical speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy.\\n3.  **Curse of Dimensionality:** This is a major concern for basis function methods. Unless explicitly addressed, $M$ might grow exponentially with input dimension $D$, rendering the $O(NM)$ sampling cost impractical.\\n4.  **Generality:** How well does it work for *any* valid kernel, or only specific types? How does it handle hyperparameter changes (which would necessitate re-computation of packets)?\\n5.  **Complexity of Packet Construction:** If the construction of $\\\\phi_m(x)$ is highly complex or involves difficult optimization problems, practical implementation and robustness could be issues.\\n\\n### Recommendation\\n\\n**Conditional Accept (leaning towards Reject without more details):**\\n\\nThe idea of using \\\"Kernel Packets\\\" for GP sampling is conceptually sound and aligns with existing low-rank approximation techniques. The $O(NM)$ sampling complexity is attractive. However, the true merit of this paper hinges entirely on the **novelty and efficiency of the \\\"Kernel Packet\\\" construction method (the setup phase)** and **rigorous theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality and scaling with dimensionality.**\\n\\n**I would recommend ACCEPT if the paper clearly demonstrates:**\\n\\n1.  **Novelty:** A truly novel, principled, and efficient method for constructing the Kernel Packets that provides significant advantages (e.g., better accuracy for same $M$, faster setup, handling of non-stationary kernels, or mitigation of the curse of dimensionality) over state-of-the-art methods like RFF and advanced sparse GP techniques.\\n2.  **Rigorous Time Complexity:** A detailed and accurate analysis of *both* the setup cost and the sampling cost, including how $M$ scales with desired accuracy, $N$, and $D$.\\n3.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** Bounds on approximation error as a function of $M$, and ideally, how $M$ needs to scale with $D$ for a given error tolerance.\\n4.  **Empirical Validation:** Strong experimental results that support all claims, showing clear advantages over strong baselines across various datasets, kernel types, and dimensionalities, considering *total* computational time (setup + sampling).\\n5.  **Clear Assumptions and Limitations:** Explicitly stating the scope of the algorithm's applicability (e.g., type of kernels, domain, dimensionality).\\n\\n**I would recommend REJECT if the paper:**\\n\\n1.  **Lacks Novelty:** Merely re-applies existing basis function methods without significant innovation or compelling advantages.\\n2.  **Fails on Complexity:** Has a high setup cost (e.g., $O(N^2)$ or $O(N^3)$) that negates the fast sampling, or if $M$ scales poorly with $D$ (curse of dimensionality unaddressed).\\n3.  **No Strong Guarantees:** Provides weak or no theoretical bounds on approximation error or scaling properties.\\n4.  **Insufficient Empirical Evidence:** Does not rigorously compare against strong baselines or fails to demonstrate practical utility for large-scale or high-dimensional problems.\\n5.  **Unclear Methodology:** Leaves the construction of \\\"Kernel Packets\\\" as a black box without proper justification.\\n\\nWithout access to the actual paper, I can only provide this detailed conditional evaluation.

This makes $O(M)$ or $O(NM)$ methods impractical in high dimensions unless $M$ is fixed to a small constant, leading to poor accuracy.\\n\\n*   **Sampling Phase (Generating $f(x)$ at $N$ points):**\\n    1.  **Generate $M$ i.i.d. $N(0,1)$ variables:** $O(M)$.\\n    2.  **Evaluate $\\\\phi_m(x)$ for all $m$ and all $N$ points:** This involves $M \\\\times N$ evaluations. If each $\\\\phi_m(x)$ evaluation takes $O(1)$ time, this is $O(NM)$.\\n    3.  **Summing:** This is also $O(NM)$.\\n\\n*   **Total Time Complexity:** **Setup Cost + $O(NM)$** for sampling.\\n\\n*   **Comparison to Existing Methods:**\\n    *   **Cholesky Decomposition (Exact):** $O(N^3)$ setup, $O(N^2)$ for a single sample. Much slower than $O(NM)$ if $M \\\\ll N$.\\n    *   **Random Fourier Features (RFF):** $O(M_{RFF})$ setup (sampling frequencies), $O(NM_{RFF})$ sampling. This is highly competitive. For the \"Kernel Packet\" method to be superior, it must achieve comparable or better accuracy for a significantly smaller $M$ compared to $M_{RFF}$, or have a substantially lower setup cost if $M_{RFF}$ selection involves more computation.\\n    *   **Decoupled/Sparse GP Methods:** Often $O(NM)$ or $O(NM^2)$ for prediction/sampling, with setup costs similar to RFF for some variational methods (e.g., $O(NM^2)$ for learning inducing points if $M$ inducing points are chosen among $N$ data points).\\n\\n*   **Verdict on Time Complexity:** The $O(NM)$ sampling phase is efficient, aligning with other state-of-the-art approximation methods like RFF. The *critical factor* for the overall efficiency and practical utility is the **setup cost** of the Kernel Packets ($\\\\phi_m(x)$) and how $M$ scales with desired accuracy, $N$, and dimensionality $D$. The paper needs to provide a detailed analysis of this setup cost and its dependencies. If the setup cost is high (e.g., $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^2)$), the method is only useful if many samples are needed from the same GP prior/posterior.\\n\\n#### 4. Validity of Assumptions\\n\\n*   **Stationary Kernel:** Many basis function methods (especially those leveraging spectral properties) implicitly or explicitly assume stationary kernels. If the Kernel Packets are constructed using spectral density properties (like RFF), then stationarity is a key assumption. If they are constructed adaptively (e.g., based on local kernel properties), they might generalize to non-stationary kernels. The paper must clarify this.\\n*   **Bounded Domain:** Basis function expansions often perform best on compact domains (e.g., $[0,1]^D$). If the domain is unbounded, the choice and effectiveness of basis functions become more challenging. If the packets are specifically designed for bounded domains, this needs to be stated as a limitation.\\n*   **Smoothness of Kernel:** The number of basis functions $M$ required for a certain approximation error typically depends on the smoothness of the kernel. Smoother kernels generally require fewer basis functions. The paper should discuss this relationship.\\n*   **Low-Dimensional Data:** As highlighted in the complexity analysis, many basis function approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where $M$ grows exponentially with the input dimension $D$. If the method is primarily for low-dimensional data, this should be an explicit assumption or limitation. If it mitigates the curse of dimensionality, this is a major strength and needs a detailed explanation.\\n*   **Computational Resources for Setup:** Implicitly assumes sufficient memory and time for the setup phase, which might be demanding depending on the chosen method for constructing $\\\\phi_m(x)$.\\n\\n**Verdict on Assumptions:** The paper must clearly state and justify its assumptions regarding kernel type, domain, data dimensionality, and the computational feasibility of the setup phase. Unstated assumptions are a major weakness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n1.  **Potentially Fast Sampling:** Once the Kernel Packets are computed, generating samples is $O(NM)$, which is significantly faster than exact Cholesky decomposition for large $N$.\\n2.  **Memory Efficient:** For large $N$, storing the $M$ basis functions is $O(NM_{val})$ (where $M_{val}$ is the number of values to describe $\\\\phi_m$) rather than $O(N^2)$ for the full covariance matrix.\\n3.  **Parallelizable:** The evaluation of $\\\\phi_m(x)$ and the final summation can be highly parallelized across $N$ points and $M$ packets.\\n4.  **Flexibility (Potential):** Depending on their construction, Kernel Packets might offer more flexibility than fixed basis functions (like in standard RFF) in adapting to specific kernel structures, non-stationarity, or multi-scale phenomena.\\n\\n### Weaknesses\\n\\n1.  **Setup Cost is Critical:** The main bottleneck is likely the initial computation or optimization of the Kernel Packets. If this cost is high or scales poorly with $N$ or $D$, the benefits of fast sampling are diminished for single-sample scenarios.\\n2.  **Approximation Error:** The samples are from an approximation of the GP, not the exact GP. The paper must quantify this error and demonstrate that $M$ can be chosen small enough for practical speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy.\\n3.  **Curse of Dimensionality:** This is a major concern for basis function methods. Unless explicitly addressed, $M$ might grow exponentially with input dimension $D$, rendering the $O(NM)$ sampling cost impractical.\\n4.  **Generality:** How well does it work for *any* valid kernel, or only specific types? How does it handle hyperparameter changes (which would necessitate re-computation of packets)?\\n5.  **Complexity of Packet Construction:** If the construction of $\\\\phi_m(x)$ is highly complex or involves difficult optimization problems, practical implementation and robustness could be issues.\\n\\n### Recommendation\\n\\n**Conditional Accept (leaning towards Reject without more details):**\\n\\nThe idea of using \"Kernel Packets\" for GP sampling is conceptually sound and aligns with existing low-rank approximation techniques.

Bayesian Optimization (BO)**\\n\\n**Assumed Role of the Sampler:** In BO, a sampler could be used for:\\n1.  **Optimizing Acquisition Functions (AFs):** Many AFs (e.g., Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound) are non-convex and potentially multimodal. Efficiently finding their global maximum is crucial for selecting the next query point.\\n2.  **Thompson Sampling:** This BO strategy directly samples functions from the GP posterior and optimizes the sampled function to select the next query. A more efficient sampler could improve its performance.\\n3.  **Handling Complex Search Spaces/Constraints:** Samplers can explore highly constrained or high-dimensional spaces more effectively than gradient-based optimizers.\\n\\n**Practical Applications & Impact:**\\n*   **Faster Convergence:** If the sampler can more efficiently identify optimal (or near-optimal) query points, it would reduce the number of expensive objective function evaluations required to find a global optimum. This is paramount in real-world scenarios like hyperparameter tuning of deep neural networks, drug discovery, material design, or experimental design, where each evaluation can take hours, days, or be very costly.\\n*   **Improved Global Optima:** By better exploring the acquisition landscape (especially in multimodal cases), the sampler could help BO escape local optima, leading to better final solutions.\\n*   **Scalability to Higher Dimensions:** Many current BO methods struggle in dimensions beyond 10-20. A sampler that can efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces could significantly expand BO's applicability.\\n*   **Robustness to Challenging Landscapes:** If the sampler is less sensitive to the specific shape or ruggedness of the acquisition function, it would make BO more reliable across a wider range of problems.\\n\\n**Relevance of Experimental Results (BO):**\\n*   **Choice of Benchmark Functions:**\\n    *   **Good:** Standard synthetic benchmarks like Branin, Hartmann (3D, 6D), Ackley, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock are good starting points as they offer varying degrees of multimodality, dimensionality, and common challenges.\\n    *   **Better:** Inclusion of *higher-dimensional* synthetic functions (e.g., 20D, 50D, 100D) is crucial to demonstrate scalability.\\n    *   **Best:** **Real-world or high-fidelity simulation benchmarks** are essential for demonstrating practical relevance. Examples include hyperparameter optimization for ML models (e.g., CNNs on CIFAR-10/ImageNet, BERT models), material science problems (e.g., optimizing alloy compositions), robotics (e.g., optimizing controller parameters), or chemical process optimization. These often involve expensive, black-box functions.\\n*   **Comparison with Existing Methods:**\\n    *   **Strong Baselines are Crucial:** The sampler should be compared against state-of-the-art acquisition function optimization methods (e.g., L-BFGS with multiple restarts, CMA-ES, genetic algorithms, specialized BO samplers like DiBO, MCMC methods like HMC or NUTS applied to AFs) *and* alternative BO strategies (e.g., standard Thompson Sampling, EI with L-BFGS, UCB).\\n    *   **Fair Comparison:** Ensure baselines are implemented optimally and given sufficient computational budget/restarts.\\n*   **Metrics:**\\n    *   **Regret:** Cumulative or simple regret (difference from true global optimum) over the number of objective function evaluations is the most important metric.\\n    *   **Wall-Clock Time:** Crucial for practical applications. How much overhead does the sampler add to each BO iteration? A faster BO iteration might not compensate for a sampler that takes an excessively long time.\\n    *   **Success Rate/Robustness:** Over multiple random seeds, how consistently does the sampler find good solutions?\\n\\n#### **2. Dynamical Systems (DS)**\\n\\n**Assumed Role of the Sampler:** In the context of GPs and DS, the sampler would likely be used for:\\n1.  **Parameter Inference:** Estimating unknown parameters of GP-based models of dynamical systems (e.g., GP-ODE, GP-SDE models) by sampling from their posterior distributions.\\n2.  **State Estimation & Prediction:** Sampling from the posterior over system states or future trajectories, especially when analytical solutions are intractable (e.g., in nonlinear, non-Gaussian systems). This is critical for uncertainty quantification.\\n3.  **Model Learning:** Learning the underlying dynamics (e.g., in latent space models) where the GP captures the unknown transition function.\\n\\n**Practical Applications & Impact:**\\n*   **Robust System Identification:** More accurate and reliable inference of system parameters from noisy or sparse observational data, even for complex nonlinear dynamics. This is vital for control, diagnostics, and simulation in engineering, robotics, and biology.\\n*   **Uncertainty-Aware Control & Planning:** By accurately characterizing the uncertainty in system states and predictions, the sampler enables more robust and safer control policies (e.g., in reinforcement learning, model predictive control, robotics navigation).\\n*   **Better Long-Term Predictions:** Accurate uncertainty propagation helps in making more reliable long-term forecasts for complex systems where small errors can quickly propagate (e.g., climate modeling, epidemic forecasting).\\n*   **Data-Efficient Learning:** If the sampler allows for more robust inference from limited data, it reduces the need for extensive data collection in experimental sciences.\\n\\n**Relevance of Experimental Results (DS):**\\n*   **Choice of Benchmark Functions/Systems:**\\n    *   **Good:** Canonical nonlinear systems with known ground truth (e.g., Lotka-Volterra, Lorenz attractor, double pendulum, simple robotic arms) are good for initial validation.

This quantifies how well the model predicts and captures uncertainty.\\n    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Wall-clock time per sample, total sampling time for convergence.\\n    *   **Robustness:** Performance under different initializations, data sizes, and noise characteristics.\\n\\n#### **3. General Experimental Design & Interpretation**\\n\\n*   **Reproducibility:** Code should be open-sourced, and random seeds should be fixed.\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Results should be averaged over multiple independent runs with different random seeds.
