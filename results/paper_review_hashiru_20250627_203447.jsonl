GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Squeeze Training for Adversarial Robustness\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013; Biggio et al., 2013) crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to benign examples are capable of fooling DNNs to make incorrect predictions. The existence of such adversarial examples has raised security concerns and attracted great attention. Much endeavour has been devoted to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs over the past few years. As one of the most effective methods, adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) introduces powerful and adaptive adversarial examples during the model training process, and encourages the model to classify them correctly. In this paper, to gain a deeper understanding of DNNs, robust or not, we examine the valley of their loss landscapes and explore the existence of collaborative examples in the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of benign examples, which demonstrate extremely lower prediction loss in comparison to that of their neighbors. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the existence of such examples can be related to the adversarial robustness of DNNs. Specifically, if given a model which was trained to be adversarially more robust, then it is less likely to discover a powerful collaborative example. Moreover, incorporating such collaborative examples into model training seemingly also improves the adversarial robustness. On this point, we advocate squeeze training (ST), in which adversarial example and collaborative example of each benign example are jointly optimized in a novel procedure, such that their maximum possible prediction discrepancy is directly constrained. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ST outperforms state-of-the-arts significantly on several benchmark datasets by achieving a robust accuracy gain of +1.13% without utilizing additional data on CIFAR-10, and it can also be readily combined with a variety of recent efforts, e.g., RST (Carmon et al., 2019) and RWP (Wu et al., 2020b), to further improve the performance. 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK:  2.1 ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES: We first introduce symbols and notations in this paper. Let xi and yi denote a benign example (e.g., a natural image) and its label from a dataset S = {(xi, yi)}ni=1, respectively, where xi \u2208 X and yi \u2208 Y = {0, . . . , C \u2212 1}. We use B\u03f5[xi] = {x\u2032 | \u2225x\u2032 \u2212 xi\u2225\u221e \u2264 \u03f5} to represent the \u03f5-bounded l\u221e neighborhood of the natural image xi. The DNN model parameterized by a set of parameters \u0398 can be defined as a function f\u0398(\u00b7) : X \u2192 RC . Without ambiguity, we shall drop the subscript \u0398 in f\u0398(\u00b7) and write it as f(\u00b7) in the sequel of this paper. In general, adversarial examples are almost perceptually indistinguishable to benign examples, yet lead to arbitrarily incorrect predictions on the victim models. One typical formulation for generating an adversarial example is to maximize the prediction loss in a constrained local neighborhood of a benign example. Projected gradient descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) (or the iterative fast gradient sign method, i.e., I-FGSM (Kurakin et al., 2017)) is commonly chosen for achieving the aim. It seeks possible adversarial examples by leveraging the gradient of g = \u2113\u25e6f w.r.t. its inputs, where \u2113 is a loss function (e.g., the cross-entropy loss CE(\u00b7, y)). Given a starting point x0, an iterative update is performed with: xt+1 = \u03a0B\u03f5[x](x t + \u03b1 \u00b7 sign(\u2207xtCE(f(xt), y))), (1) where xt is a temporary result obtained at the t-th step and function \u03a0B\u03f5[x](\u00b7) projects its input onto the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of the benign example. The starting point can be the benign example (for I-FGSM) or its randomly neighbor (for PGD). Besides I-FGSM and PGD, the single-step FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015), C&W\u2019s attack (Carlini & Wagner, 2017), DeepFool (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2019), and the momentum iterative FGSM (Dong et al., 2018) are also popular and effective for generating adversarial examples. Some work also investigates the way of generating adversarial examples without any knowledge of the victim model, which are known as black-box attacks (Papernot et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020) and no-box attacks (Papernot et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020). Recently, the ensemble of a variety of attacks becomes popular for performing adversarial attack and evaluating adversarial robustness. Such a strong adversarial benchmark, called AutoAttack (AA) (Croce & Hein, 2020), consists of three white-box attacks, i.e., APGD-CE, APGD-DLR, and FAB (Croce & Hein, 2019), and one black-box attack, i.e., the Square Attack (Andriushchenko et al., 2019). We adopt it in experimental evaluations. In this paper, we explore valley of the loss landscape of DNNs and study the benefit of incorporating collaborative examples into adversarial training. In an independent paper (Tao et al., 2022), hypocritical examples were explored for concealing mistakes of a model, as an attack. These examples also lied in the valley. Yet, due to the difference in aim, studies of hypocritical examples in (Tao et al., 2022) were mainly performed based on mis-classified benign examples according to their formal definition, while our work concerns local landscapes around all benign examples. Other related work include unadversarial examples (Salman et al., 2021) and assistive signals (Pestana et al., 2021) that designed 3D textures to customize objects for better classifying them. 2.2 ADVERSARIAL TRAINING (AT): Among the numerous methods for defending against adversarial examples, adversarial training that incorporates such examples into model training is probably one of the most effective ones. We will revisit some representative adversarial training methods in this subsection. Vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018) formulates the training objective as a simple min-max game. Adversarial examples are first generated using for instance PGD to maximize some loss (e.g., the cross-entropy loss) in the objective, and then the model parameters are optimized to minimize the same loss with the obtained adversarial examples: min \u0398 max x\u2032i\u2208B\u03f5[xi] CE(f(x\u2032i), yi). (2) Although effective in improving adversarial robustness, the vanilla AT method inevitably leads to decrease in the prediction accuracy of benign examples, therefore several follow-up methods discuss improved and more principled ways to better trade off clean and robust accuracy (Zhang et al., 2019; Kannan et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). Such methods advocate regularizing the output of benign example and its adversarial neighbors. With remarkable empirical performance, they are regarded as strong baselines, and we will introduce a representative one, i.e., TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019). TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019) advocates a learning objective comprising two loss terms. Its first term penalizes the cross-entropy loss of benign training samples, and the second term regularizes the difference between benign output and the output of possibly malicious data points. Specifically, the worst-case Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the output of each benign example and that of any suspicious data point in its \u03f5-bounded l\u221e neighborhood is minimized in the regularization term: min \u0398 \u2211 i (CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 max x\u2032\u2208B\u03f5[xi] KL(f(x\u2032i), f(xi))). (3) Other efforts have also been devoted in the family of adversarial training research, e.g., MART (Wang et al., 2020), robust self training (RST) (Carmon et al., 2019), and adversarial weight perturbation (AWP) (Wu et al., 2020b). More specifically, after investigating the influence of mis-classified samples on model robustness, MART advocates giving specific focus to these samples for robustness. AWP identifies that flatter loss changing with respect to parameter perturbation leads to improved generalization of adversarial training, and provides a novel double perturbation mechanism. RST proposes to boost adversarial training by using unlabeled data and incorporating semi-supervised learning. Rebuffi et al. (2021) focus on data augmentation and study the performance of using generative models. There are also insightful work that focuses on model architectures (Huang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020a; Bai et al., 2021; Mao et al., 2021; Paul & Chen, 2021), batch normalization (Xie et al., 2020a), and activation functions (Xie et al., 2020b; Dai et al., 2021). Distilling from adversarially trained models has also been widely studied (Zi et al., 2021; Shao et al., 2021; Awais et al., 2021). Our ST for improving adversarial robustness is partially inspired by recent adversarial training effort, and we will discuss and compare to TRADES and other state-of-the-arts in Section 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2. Besides, our method can be naturally combined with a variety of other prior effort introduced in this section, to achieve further improvements, as will be demonstrated in Section 5. 3 COLLABORATIVE EXAMPLES: With the surge of interest in adversarial examples, we have achieved some understandings of plateau regions on the loss landscape of DNNs. However, valleys of the landscape seem less explored. In this section, we examine the valleys and explore the existence of collaborative examples, i.e., data points are capable of achieving extremely lower classification loss, in the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of benign examples. In particular, we discuss how adversarial robustness of DNNs and the collaborative examples affect each other, by providing several intriguing observations. 3.1 VALLEY OF THE LOSS LANDSCAPE: Unlike adversarial examples that are data points with higher or even maximal prediction loss, we pay attention to local minimum around benign examples in this subsection. To achieve this, we here simply adapt the PGD method to instead minimize the prediction loss with: xt+1 = \u03a0B\u03f5[x](x t \u2212 \u03b1 \u00b7 sign(\u2207xtCE(f(xt), y))). (4) Comparing Eq. (4) to (1), it can be seen that their main difference is that, in Eq. (4), gradient descent is performed rather than gradient ascent. Similar to the I-FGSM and PGD attack, we clip the result in Eq. (4) after each update iteration to guarantee that the perturbation is within a presumed budget, Figure 2: Visualization of benign example (left), collaborative example crafted on a normally trained ResNet-18 model (middle), and collaborative example crafted on a robust ResNet-18 model (right). (a) normal (b) robust Figure 3: The loss landscapes in (a) and (b) show a normal ResNet-18 and an adversarially trained ResNet-18 using TRADES, respectively, all on CIFAR-100. e.g., 4/255, 8/255, 16/255, or 32/255. We perform such an update with a step size of \u03b1 = 1/255. ResNet (He et al., 2016b) and wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) models trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are tested. After multiple update steps (preciously 100 steps for this experiment), we evaluate the cross-entropy loss of the obtained examples. We compare it to the benign loss in the left most panels in Figure 1. It can be seen that, though benign data shows relatively low cross-entropy loss (i.e.,\u223c 0.2 on average for ResNet-18 on the CIFAR-10 test set) already, there always exists neighboring data that easily achieve extremely lower loss values (i.e., almost 0 on average). Such data points that show considerably lower prediction loss are collaborative examples of our interest. See Figure 2 for visualization of the collaborative examples generated on the basis of a randomly chosen CIFAR-100 image. The existence of collaborative examples implies large local Lipschitz constants or non-smoothness of g = \u2113 \u25e6 f , from a somehow different perspective against the conventional adversarial phenomenon. To shed more light on this, we further test with DNN models that were trained to be robust to adversarial examples, using the vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020) 1. The results can be found in the right panels in Figure 1. We see it is more difficult to achieve zero prediction loss with these models, probably owing to smoother and flatter loss landscapes (Li et al., 2018). See Figure 3, in which the perturbation direction u is obtained utilizing Eq. (4), and v is random chosen in a hyperplane orthogonal to u. We analyze the angle between collaborative perturbations and PGD adversarial perturbations in Appendix B. 3.2 HOW CAN COLLABORATIVE EXAMPLES AID?: Given the results that the collaborative examples are less \u201cdestructive\u201d on a more adversarially robust model, we raise a question: How can collaborative examples in return benefit adversarial robustness? Towards answering the question, one may first try to incorporate the collaborative examples into the training phase to see whether adversarial robustness of the obtained DNN model can be improved. To this end, we resort to the following learning objective: min \u0398 \u2211 i (CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 \u00b7KL(f(xcoli ), f(xi))), (5) where xcoli is a collaborative example generated using the method introduced in Section 3.1. Eq. (5) minimizes the output discrepancy between the collaborative examples and their corresponding benign examples, in addition to the loss term that encourages correct prediction on benign examples. This simple and straightforward method has been similarly adopted in Tao et al.\u2019s work (Tao et al., 2022) for resisting hypocritical examples. A quick experiment is performed here to test its benefit to adversarial robustness in our settings. The inner update for obtaining collaborative examples is performed over 10 steps, with a step size of \u03b1 = 2/255 and a perturbation budget of \u03f5 = 8/255. We evaluate prediction accuracy on the PGD adversarial examples and benign examples for comparison. Figure 4 shows the test-set performance of ResNet-18 trained as normal and trained using Eq. (5) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. It can be seen that the robust accuracy is improved remarkably by solely incorporating collaborative examples into training. In the meanwhile, those normally trained models consistently show \u223c 0% robust accuracy. 1All models trained via adversarial training show quite good robust accuracy under adversarial attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Clean and robust accuracy of these models are provided in Appendix A. However, there still exists a considerable gap between the obtained performance of Eq. (5) and that of TRADES (see Figure 9 in Appendix). Robust overfitting (Rice et al., 2020) can be observed on the red curves in Figure 4 (especially after the 80-th epoch), even though training with collaborative examples and testing with adversarial examples, and it seems more severe in comparison to that occurs with existing adversarial training methods. We also test other DNN architectures, e.g., VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) and wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), and the results are similar. 4 SQUEEZE TRAINING (ST): In the above section, we have experimentally shown that collaborative examples exist and they can be used to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs, by simply enforcing their output probabilities to be close to the output of their corresponding benign neighbors. In this section, we consider utilizing collaborative examples and adversarial examples jointly during training, aiming at regularizing non-smooth regions of the whole loss landscape altogether. 4.1 METHOD: The adversarial examples can be utilized during training in a variety of ways, leading to various adversarial training methods. Considering that the adversarial and collaborative examples control the upper and lower bound of the prediction loss, respectively, we propose to penalize the maximum possible output discrepancy of any two data points within the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of each benign example. Inspired by the adversarial regularization in, e.g., TRADES, we adopt a benign prediction loss term in combination with a term in which possible adversarial examples and possible collaborative examples are jointly regularized. By contrast, the benign example itself is not necessarily involved in error accumulation from the regularization term. That is, the output of a benign example is neither explicitly encouraged to be \u201cadversarial\u201d nor to be \u201ccollaborative\u201d. To achieve this, we advocate squeeze training (ST) which squeezes possible prediction gaps and jointly regularizes the two sorts of non-smooth and steep regions of the loss landscape. The learning objective of ST is: min \u0398 \u2211 i (CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 max x\u2032 \u2208B\u03f5[xi] x\u2032\u2032\u2208B\u03f5[xi] \u2113reg(f(x \u2032 i), f(x \u2032\u2032 i ))) s.t. pf (yi |x\u2032i) \u2265 pf (yi |xi) \u2265 pf (yi |x\u2032\u2032i ), \u2200i, (6) where \u2113reg(\u00b7) is a regularization function which evaluates the discrepancy between two probability vectors, and \u03b2 is a scaling factor which balances clean and robust errors. The constraint in Eq. (6) is of the essence and introduced to ensure that the two examples obtained in the inner optimization include one adversarial example and one collaborative example, considering it makes little sense to minimize the gap between two adversarial examples or between two collaborative examples. There are several different choices for the regularization function \u2113reg, e.g., the Jensen\u2013Shannon (JS) divergence, the squared l2 distance, and the symmetric KL divergence, which are formulated as follows: (1) JS: \u2113reg = 1 2 (KL( f(x\u2032) + f(x\u2032\u2032) 2 , f(x\u2032)) + KL( f(x\u2032) + f(x\u2032\u2032) 2 , f(x\u2032\u2032))), (2) (Squared) l2: \u2113reg = \u2225f(x\u2032)\u2212 f(x\u2032\u2032)\u222522, Algorithm 1 Squeeze Training (ST) Input: A set of benign example and their labels S, number of training iterations T , learning rate \u03b7, number of inner optimization steps K, perturbation budget \u03f5, step size \u03b1, and a choice of regularization function \u2113reg, Initialization: Perform random initialization for f , for t = 1, . . . , T do Sample a mini-batch of training data {(xi, y)}mi=1 for i = 1, . . . ,m (in parallel) do x\u2032i \u2190 xi + 0.001 \u00b7 N (0, I) , x\u2032\u2032i \u2190 xi + 0.001 \u00b7 N (0, I) while K \u2265 0 do xadvi \u2190 argmax x\u0303i\u2208{xi,x\u2032i,x\u2032\u2032i } CE(f(x\u0303i), yi) , xcoli \u2190 argmin x\u0303i\u2208{xi,x\u2032i,x\u2032\u2032i } CE(f(x\u0303i), yi) ginner = \u2113reg(f(x adv i ), f(x col i )) x\u2032i \u2190 \u03a0B\u03f5[xi](xadvi +\u03b1\u00b7sign(\u2207xadvi ginner)) , x \u2032\u2032 i \u2190 \u03a0B\u03f5[xi](xcoli +\u03b1\u00b7sign(\u2207xcoli ginner)) K \u2190 K \u2212 1 end while gi \u2190 CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 \u00b7 \u2113reg(f(xadvi ), f(xcoli )) end for \u0398\u2190 \u0398\u2212 \u03b7 1m \u2211m i=1\u2207\u0398gi end for Output: A robust classifier f parameterized by \u0398. (3) Symmetric KL: \u2113reg = 1 2 (KL(f(x\u2032), f(x\u2032\u2032)) + KL(f(x\u2032\u2032), f(x\u2032))). Among these choices, the (squared) l2 and JS divergence are already symmetric, and we also adapt the original KL divergence to make it satisfy the symmetry axiom of desirable metrics, such that the adversarial examples and collaborative examples are treated equally. With the formulation in Eq. (6), pairs of collaborative and adversarial examples are obtained simultaneously, and the inner optimization are thus different from Eq. (1) and (4). The procedure can be implemented as in Algorithm 1, with modified PGD for achieving temporary results and consistent comparisons between prediction loss of the temporary results for guaranteeing chained inequality. 4.2 DISCUSSIONS We would like to first mention that, although Eq. (6) is partially inspired by TRADES, the collaborative examples can generally and naturally be introduced to other adversarial training formulations. Then, we compare Eq. (6) and TRADES carefully. We know that the latter regularizes KL divergence between benign examples and their neighboring data points. While, a neighboring data point that shows maximal KL divergence from the benign output, can be an adversarial example or a collaborative example actually. In Figure 5, we demonstrate the ratio of collaborative examples and the prediction loss of different examples along with the training using TRADES proceeds. It can be observed that the ratio of collaborative examples used for model optimization decreases consistently, and being always less than 50%. Our ST aims to use 100% of the collaborative and adversarial examples, if possible. Comparing with TRADES, the \u2113reg term in our ST imposes a stricter regularization, since the maximum possible output discrepancy between any two data points within the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood is penalized, which bounds the TRADES regularization from above. In this regard, the worst-case outputs (i.e., adversarial outputs) and the best-case outputs (collaborative outputs) are expected to be optimized jointly and equally. Moreover, as has been mentioned, since ST does not explicitly enforce the benign output probabilities to match the output of adversarial examples as in TRADES, we may expect improved trade-off between robust and clean accuracy. Extensive experimental comparison to TRADES in Section 5 will verify that our ST indeed outperforms it significantly, probably benefits from these merits. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we compare the proposed ST to state-of-the-art methods. We mainly compare to vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020). Performance of other outstanding methods (Zhang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Kim et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022) will be compared in Section 5.3, as additional data may be used. Experiments are conducted on popular benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011). Table 1 summarizes our main results, with ResNet (He et al., 2016b). We also test with wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) to show that our method works as well on large-scale classification models, whose results can be found in Table 3 and 4. It is worth noting that our ST can be readily combined with many recent advances, e.g., AWP (Wu et al., 2020b) and RST (Carmon et al., 2019). AWP utilizes weight perturbation in addition to input perturbation. We can combine ST with it by replacing its learning objective with ours. RST uses unlabeled data to boost the performance of adversarial training. It first produces pseudo labels for unlabeled data, and then minimizes a regularization loss on both labeled and unlabeled data. Training settings. In most experiments in this section, we perform adversarial training with a perturbation budget of \u03f5 = 8/255 and an inner step size \u03b1 = 2/255, except for the SVHN dataset, where we use \u03b1 = 1/255. In the training phase, we always use an SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9, a weight decay of 0.0005, and a batch size of 128. We train ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016a) for 120 epochs on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and we adopt an initial learning rate of 0.1 and cut it by 10\u00d7 at the 80-th and 100-th epoch. For SVHN, we train ResNet-18 for 80 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.01, and we cut by 10\u00d7 at the 50-th and 65-th epoch. We adopt \u03b2 = 6 for TRADES and \u03b2 = 5 for MART by following their original papers. The final choice for the regularization function \u2113reg and the scaling factor \u03b2 in our ST will be given in Section 5.1. All models are trained on an NVIDIA Tesla-V100 GPU. Evaluation details. We evaluate the performance of adversarially trained models by computing their clean and robust accuracy. For robust accuracy, we perform various white-box attack methods including FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015), PGD (Madry et al., 2018), C&W\u2019s attack (Carlini & Wagner, 2017), and AutoAttack (AA) (Croce & Hein, 2020). Specifically, we perform PGD-20, PGD100, and C&W\u221e (i.e., the l\u221e version of C&W\u2019s loss optimized using PGD-100) under \u03f5 = 8/255 and \u03b1 = 2/255. Since adversarial training generally shows overfitting (Rice et al., 2020), we select the model with the best PGD-20 performance from all checkpoints, as suggested in many recent papers (Zhang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020; Gowal et al., 2021). 5.1 COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT DISCREPANCY METRICS: To get started, we compare the three choices of discrepancy metric for \u2113reg , e.g., the JS divergence, the squared l2 distance, and the symmetric KL divergence. In Figure 6, we summarize the performance of ST with these choices. We vary the scaling factor \u03b2 to demonstrate the trade-off between clean and robust accuracy, and the robust accuracy is evaluated using AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) which provides reliable evaluations. For a fair comparison, we also evaluate TRADES with the original KL divergence function being replaced with these newly introduced discrepancy functions and illustrate the results in the same plots (i.e., Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c)) correspondingly. The performance curve of the original TRADES is shown in every sub-figure (in grey). See Table 2 for all \u03b2 values in the figure. From Figure 6(a) to 6(c), one can see that considerably improved trade-off between the clean and robust accuracy is achieved by using our ST, in comparison to TRADES using the same discrepancy metric for measuring the gap between probability vectors. Moreover, in Figure 6(d), it can be seen that our ST with different choices for the discrepancy functions always outperforms the original TRADES by a large margin, and using the symmetric KL divergence for \u2113reg leads to the best performance overall. We will stick with the symmetric KL divergence for ST in our following comparison, and we use \u03b2 = 6 for CIFAR-10, \u03b2 = 4 for CIFAR-100, and \u03b2 = 8 for SVHN. 5.2 COMPARISON TO STATE-OF-THE-ARTS: Table 1 reports the performance of our adversarial training method ST and its competitors. Intensive results demonstrate that ST outperforms the vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020) significantly, gaining consistently higher clean and robust accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. In other words, our ST significantly enhances adversarial robustness with less degradation of clean accuracy, indicating better trade-off between clean and robust performance. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, the best prior method shows classification accuracy of 49.37% and 82.41%on the adversarial and clean test sets, respectively, while our ST with symmetric KL achieves 50.50% (+1.13%) and 83.10% (+0.69%). Combining with AWP (Wu et al., 2020b), we further gain an absolute improvement of 0.92% and 1.37% in robust and clean accuracy, respectively, compared to TRADES+AWP, on CIFAR-10. Similar observations can be made on CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Complexity analyses of our method is deferred to Appendix C, and training curves are given in Figure 8 to demonstrate less overfitting than that in Figure 4. In addition to the experiments on ResNet-18, we also employ larger-scale DNNs, i.e., wide ResNet (WRN) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). We train robust WRN models, including robust WRN-34-5 and robust WRN-34-10 on CIFAR-10, and we report their results in Table 3. Obviously, the WRN models lead to higher clean and robust accuracy than that of the ResNet-18. Importantly, our ST still outperforms competitors on these networks, showing that the effectiveness of our method holds when the size of DNN model scales. Another WRN, i.e., WRN28-10, is also tested and the same observations can be made. We will test with it carefully in Section 5.3, in which additional unlabeled data is utilized during training. 5.3 ADVERSARIAL TRAINING WITH ADDITIONAL UNLABELED DATA: RST (Carmon et al., 2019) is a recent work that confirms unlabeled data could also be properly incorporated into training for enhancing adversarial robustness. Here we consider a simple and direct combination with it. Recall that, in the RST paper, it extracted 500K unlabeled data from 80 Million Tiny Images (Torralba et al., 2008). To utilize these unlabeled images, it generates pseudo labels for them, then performs adversarial training on a set including all CIFAR-10 training images and the originally unlabeled data. Our ST can easily be incorporated after obtaining the pseudo labels. We implement RST and our combination with it (called ST-RST) by following settings in the original paper of RST. Table 4 report empirical results. We then compare the performance of ST-RST to recent work that utilizes the same set of unlabeled data, i.e., GAIR-RST (Zhang et al., 2020), AWP-RST (Wu et al., 2020b), BAT-RST (Kim et al., 2021), and RWPRST (Yu et al., 2022). Their results are collected from official implementations. For RWP-RST, which is in fact one of the best solutions in the same setting on RobustBench (Croce et al., 2020), it achieves robust accuracy of 60.36% by sacrificing clean accuracy, while our ST-RST gains +0.39% and +1.53% in robust and clean accuracy comparing to it. 6 CONCLUSION: In this paper, we have studied the loss landscape of DNN models (robust or not) and specifically paid more attention to the valley region of the landscapes where collaborative examples widely exist. We have verified that collaborative examples can be utilized to benefit adversarial robustness. In particular, we have proposed ST, a squeeze training method, to take both adversarial examples and collaborative examples into accounts, jointly and equally, for regularizing the loss landscape during DNN training, forming a novel regularization regime. Extensive experiments have shown that our ST outperforms current state-of-the-arts across different benchmark datasets and network architectures, and it can be combined with recent advances (including RST and AWP) to gain further progress in improving adversarial robustness. A PERFORMANCE OF MODELS IN FIGURE 1:  B COLLABORATIVE AND ADVERSARIAL DIRECTIONS: We analyze the angle between collaborative perturbations and PGD adversarial perturbations. We summarize the experiments in Figure 7 After a bunch of update steps, we observe that it lies in a limited range around 90\u25e6, which is unsurprising in the high dimensional input space. However, for more robust models, we see that the angle deviate more from 90\u25e6, indicating that powerful collaborative and adversarial perturbations become more correlated on the robust landscapes. C COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF ST: Since the adversarial examples and collaborative examples are both required in ST, the computational complexity in its inner optimization increases. Yet, we note that the two sorts of examples can be computed in parallel, thus the run time of our ST can be similar or only slightly higher than that of the baseline. Furthermore, the performance of previous state-of-the-arts does not in fact improve with higher computational capacity (e.g., more inner optimization steps). For instance, TRADES show slightly better robust accuracy (AA: 49.76%\u00b1 0.09%) but decreased clean accuracy (81.57%\u00b1 0.14%) on CIFAR-10 with 2\u00d7 more inner steps, which are both not better than our ST (AA: 50.50%\u00b1 0.07%, and clean accuracy: 83.10%\u00b1 0.10%). D TRAINING CURVES OF ST:  E TO MAKE \u201cADVERSARIAL\u201d AND \u201cCOLLABORATIVE\u201d CLEAR: In this paper, we generalize the definition of adversarial examples to include all data points (in the bounded neighborhood of benign examples) showing considerable higher prediction loss than that of the benign loss, in contrast to the definition in a narrower sense saying that different label prediction ought to be made. The collaborative examples are similarly \u201cdefined\u201d, somewhat non-rigorously. Throughout the paper, we use the word \u201cadversarial\u201d and \u201ccollaborative\u201d to indicate perturbed data points with considerable higher and lower loss than the benign loss, respectively.

The paper title is: Squeeze Training for Adversarial Robustness\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013; Biggio et al., 2013) crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to benign examples are capable of fooling DNNs to make incorrect predictions. The existence of such adversarial examples has raised security concerns and attracted great attention. Much endeavour has been devoted to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs over the past few years. As one of the most effective methods, adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) introduces powerful and adaptive adversarial examples during the model training process, and encourages the model to classify them correctly. In this paper, to gain a deeper understanding of DNNs, robust or not, we examine the valley of their loss landscapes and explore the existence of collaborative examples in the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of benign examples, which demonstrate extremely lower prediction loss in comparison to that of their neighbors. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the existence of such examples can be related to the adversarial robustness of DNNs. Specifically, if given a model which was trained to be adversarially more robust, then it is less likely to discover a powerful collaborative example. Moreover, incorporating such collaborative examples into model training seemingly also improves the adversarial robustness. On this point, we advocate squeeze training (ST), in which adversarial example and collaborative example of each benign example are jointly optimized in a novel procedure, such that their maximum possible prediction discrepancy is directly constrained. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ST outperforms state-of-the-arts significantly on several benchmark datasets by achieving a robust accuracy gain of +1.13% without utilizing additional data on CIFAR-10, and it can also be readily combined with a variety of recent efforts, e.g., RST (Carmon et al., 2019) and RWP (Wu et al., 2020b), to further improve the performance. 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK:  2.1 ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES: We first introduce symbols and notations in this paper. Let xi and yi denote a benign example (e.g., a natural image) and its label from a dataset S = {(xi, yi)}ni=1, respectively, where xi \u2208 X and yi \u2208 Y = {0, . . . , C \u2212 1}. We use B\u03f5[xi] = {x\u2032 | \u2225x\u2032 \u2212 xi\u2225\u221e \u2264 \u03f5} to represent the \u03f5-bounded l\u221e neighborhood of the natural image xi. The DNN model parameterized by a set of parameters \u0398 can be defined as a function f\u0398(\u00b7) : X \u2192 RC . Without ambiguity, we shall drop the subscript \u0398 in f\u0398(\u00b7) and write it as f(\u00b7) in the sequel of this paper. In general, adversarial examples are almost perceptually indistinguishable to benign examples, yet lead to arbitrarily incorrect predictions on the victim models. One typical formulation for generating an adversarial example is to maximize the prediction loss in a constrained local neighborhood of a benign example. Projected gradient descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) (or the iterative fast gradient sign method, i.e., I-FGSM (Kurakin et al., 2017)) is commonly chosen for achieving the aim. It seeks possible adversarial examples by leveraging the gradient of g = \u2113\u25e6f w.r.t. its inputs, where \u2113 is a loss function (e.g., the cross-entropy loss CE(\u00b7, y)). Given a starting point x0, an iterative update is performed with: xt+1 = \u03a0B\u03f5[x](x t + \u03b1 \u00b7 sign(\u2207xtCE(f(xt), y))), (1) where xt is a temporary result obtained at the t-th step and function \u03a0B\u03f5[x](\u00b7) projects its input onto the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of the benign example. The starting point can be the benign example (for I-FGSM) or its randomly neighbor (for PGD). Besides I-FGSM and PGD, the single-step FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015), C&W\u2019s attack (Carlini & Wagner, 2017), DeepFool (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2019), and the momentum iterative FGSM (Dong et al., 2018) are also popular and effective for generating adversarial examples. Some work also investigates the way of generating adversarial examples without any knowledge of the victim model, which are known as black-box attacks (Papernot et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020) and no-box attacks (Papernot et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020). Recently, the ensemble of a variety of attacks becomes popular for performing adversarial attack and evaluating adversarial robustness. Such a strong adversarial benchmark, called AutoAttack (AA) (Croce & Hein, 2020), consists of three white-box attacks, i.e., APGD-CE, APGD-DLR, and FAB (Croce & Hein, 2019), and one black-box attack, i.e., the Square Attack (Andriushchenko et al., 2019). We adopt it in experimental evaluations. In this paper, we explore valley of the loss landscape of DNNs and study the benefit of incorporating collaborative examples into adversarial training. In an independent paper (Tao et al., 2022), hypocritical examples were explored for concealing mistakes of a model, as an attack. These examples also lied in the valley. Yet, due to the difference in aim, studies of hypocritical examples in (Tao et al., 2022) were mainly performed based on mis-classified benign examples according to their formal definition, while our work concerns local landscapes around all benign examples. Other related work include unadversarial examples (Salman et al., 2021) and assistive signals (Pestana et al., 2021) that designed 3D textures to customize objects for better classifying them. 2.2 ADVERSARIAL TRAINING (AT): Among the numerous methods for defending against adversarial examples, adversarial training that incorporates such examples into model training is probably one of the most effective ones. We will revisit some representative adversarial training methods in this subsection. Vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018) formulates the training objective as a simple min-max game. Adversarial examples are first generated using for instance PGD to maximize some loss (e.g., the cross-entropy loss) in the objective, and then the model parameters are optimized to minimize the same loss with the obtained adversarial examples: min \u0398 max x\u2032i\u2208B\u03f5[xi] CE(f(x\u2032i), yi). (2) Although effective in improving adversarial robustness, the vanilla AT method inevitably leads to decrease in the prediction accuracy of benign examples, therefore several follow-up methods discuss improved and more principled ways to better trade off clean and robust accuracy (Zhang et al., 2019; Kannan et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). Such methods advocate regularizing the output of benign example and its adversarial neighbors. With remarkable empirical performance, they are regarded as strong baselines, and we will introduce a representative one, i.e., TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019). TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019) advocates a learning objective comprising two loss terms. Its first term penalizes the cross-entropy loss of benign training samples, and the second term regularizes the difference between benign output and the output of possibly malicious data points. Specifically, the worst-case Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the output of each benign example and that of any suspicious data point in its \u03f5-bounded l\u221e neighborhood is minimized in the regularization term: min \u0398 \u2211 i (CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 max x\u2032\u2208B\u03f5[xi] KL(f(x\u2032i), f(xi))). (3) Other efforts have also been devoted in the family of adversarial training research, e.g., MART (Wang et al., 2020), robust self training (RST) (Carmon et al., 2019), and adversarial weight perturbation (AWP) (Wu et al., 2020b). More specifically, after investigating the influence of mis-classified samples on model robustness, MART advocates giving specific focus to these samples for robustness. AWP identifies that flatter loss changing with respect to parameter perturbation leads to improved generalization of adversarial training, and provides a novel double perturbation mechanism. RST proposes to boost adversarial training by using unlabeled data and incorporating semi-supervised learning. Rebuffi et al. (2021) focus on data augmentation and study the performance of using generative models. There are also insightful work that focuses on model architectures (Huang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020a; Bai et al., 2021; Mao et al., 2021; Paul & Chen, 2021), batch normalization (Xie et al., 2020a), and activation functions (Xie et al., 2020b; Dai et al., 2021). Distilling from adversarially trained models has also been widely studied (Zi et al., 2021; Shao et al., 2021; Awais et al., 2021). Our ST for improving adversarial robustness is partially inspired by recent adversarial training effort, and we will discuss and compare to TRADES and other state-of-the-arts in Section 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2. Besides, our method can be naturally combined with a variety of other prior effort introduced in this section, to achieve further improvements, as will be demonstrated in Section 5. 3 COLLABORATIVE EXAMPLES: With the surge of interest in adversarial examples, we have achieved some understandings of plateau regions on the loss landscape of DNNs. However, valleys of the landscape seem less explored. In this section, we examine the valleys and explore the existence of collaborative examples, i.e., data points are capable of achieving extremely lower classification loss, in the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of benign examples. In particular, we discuss how adversarial robustness of DNNs and the collaborative examples affect each other, by providing several intriguing observations. 3.1 VALLEY OF THE LOSS LANDSCAPE: Unlike adversarial examples that are data points with higher or even maximal prediction loss, we pay attention to local minimum around benign examples in this subsection. To achieve this, we here simply adapt the PGD method to instead minimize the prediction loss with: xt+1 = \u03a0B\u03f5[x](x t \u2212 \u03b1 \u00b7 sign(\u2207xtCE(f(xt), y))). (4) Comparing Eq. (4) to (1), it can be seen that their main difference is that, in Eq. (4), gradient descent is performed rather than gradient ascent. Similar to the I-FGSM and PGD attack, we clip the result in Eq. (4) after each update iteration to guarantee that the perturbation is within a presumed budget, Figure 2: Visualization of benign example (left), collaborative example crafted on a normally trained ResNet-18 model (middle), and collaborative example crafted on a robust ResNet-18 model (right). (a) normal (b) robust Figure 3: The loss landscapes in (a) and (b) show a normal ResNet-18 and an adversarially trained ResNet-18 using TRADES, respectively, all on CIFAR-100. e.g., 4/255, 8/255, 16/255, or 32/255. We perform such an update with a step size of \u03b1 = 1/255. ResNet (He et al., 2016b) and wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) models trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are tested. After multiple update steps (preciously 100 steps for this experiment), we evaluate the cross-entropy loss of the obtained examples. We compare it to the benign loss in the left most panels in Figure 1. It can be seen that, though benign data shows relatively low cross-entropy loss (i.e.,\u223c 0.2 on average for ResNet-18 on the CIFAR-10 test set) already, there always exists neighboring data that easily achieve extremely lower loss values (i.e., almost 0 on average). Such data points that show considerably lower prediction loss are collaborative examples of our interest. See Figure 2 for visualization of the collaborative examples generated on the basis of a randomly chosen CIFAR-100 image. The existence of collaborative examples implies large local Lipschitz constants or non-smoothness of g = \u2113 \u25e6 f , from a somehow different perspective against the conventional adversarial phenomenon. To shed more light on this, we further test with DNN models that were trained to be robust to adversarial examples, using the vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020) 1. The results can be found in the right panels in Figure 1. We see it is more difficult to achieve zero prediction loss with these models, probably owing to smoother and flatter loss landscapes (Li et al., 2018). See Figure 3, in which the perturbation direction u is obtained utilizing Eq. (4), and v is random chosen in a hyperplane orthogonal to u. We analyze the angle between collaborative perturbations and PGD adversarial perturbations in Appendix B. 3.2 HOW CAN COLLABORATIVE EXAMPLES AID?: Given the results that the collaborative examples are less \u201cdestructive\u201d on a more adversarially robust model, we raise a question: How can collaborative examples in return benefit adversarial robustness? Towards answering the question, one may first try to incorporate the collaborative examples into the training phase to see whether adversarial robustness of the obtained DNN model can be improved. To this end, we resort to the following learning objective: min \u0398 \u2211 i (CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 \u00b7KL(f(xcoli ), f(xi))), (5) where xcoli is a collaborative example generated using the method introduced in Section 3.1. Eq. (5) minimizes the output discrepancy between the collaborative examples and their corresponding benign examples, in addition to the loss term that encourages correct prediction on benign examples. This simple and straightforward method has been similarly adopted in Tao et al.\u2019s work (Tao et al., 2022) for resisting hypocritical examples. A quick experiment is performed here to test its benefit to adversarial robustness in our settings. The inner update for obtaining collaborative examples is performed over 10 steps, with a step size of \u03b1 = 2/255 and a perturbation budget of \u03f5 = 8/255. We evaluate prediction accuracy on the PGD adversarial examples and benign examples for comparison. Figure 4 shows the test-set performance of ResNet-18 trained as normal and trained using Eq. (5) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. It can be seen that the robust accuracy is improved remarkably by solely incorporating collaborative examples into training. In the meanwhile, those normally trained models consistently show \u223c 0% robust accuracy. 1All models trained via adversarial training show quite good robust accuracy under adversarial attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Clean and robust accuracy of these models are provided in Appendix A. However, there still exists a considerable gap between the obtained performance of Eq. (5) and that of TRADES (see Figure 9 in Appendix). Robust overfitting (Rice et al., 2020) can be observed on the red curves in Figure 4 (especially after the 80-th epoch), even though training with collaborative examples and testing with adversarial examples, and it seems more severe in comparison to that occurs with existing adversarial training methods. We also test other DNN architectures, e.g., VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) and wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), and the results are similar. 4 SQUEEZE TRAINING (ST): In the above section, we have experimentally shown that collaborative examples exist and they can be used to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs, by simply enforcing their output probabilities to be close to the output of their corresponding benign neighbors. In this section, we consider utilizing collaborative examples and adversarial examples jointly during training, aiming at regularizing non-smooth regions of the whole loss landscape altogether. 4.1 METHOD: The adversarial examples can be utilized during training in a variety of ways, leading to various adversarial training methods. Considering that the adversarial and collaborative examples control the upper and lower bound of the prediction loss, respectively, we propose to penalize the maximum possible output discrepancy of any two data points within the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood of each benign example. Inspired by the adversarial regularization in, e.g., TRADES, we adopt a benign prediction loss term in combination with a term in which possible adversarial examples and possible collaborative examples are jointly regularized. By contrast, the benign example itself is not necessarily involved in error accumulation from the regularization term. That is, the output of a benign example is neither explicitly encouraged to be \u201cadversarial\u201d nor to be \u201ccollaborative\u201d. To achieve this, we advocate squeeze training (ST) which squeezes possible prediction gaps and jointly regularizes the two sorts of non-smooth and steep regions of the loss landscape. The learning objective of ST is: min \u0398 \u2211 i (CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 max x\u2032 \u2208B\u03f5[xi] x\u2032\u2032\u2208B\u03f5[xi] \u2113reg(f(x \u2032 i), f(x \u2032\u2032 i ))) s.t. pf (yi |x\u2032i) \u2265 pf (yi |xi) \u2265 pf (yi |x\u2032\u2032i ), \u2200i, (6) where \u2113reg(\u00b7) is a regularization function which evaluates the discrepancy between two probability vectors, and \u03b2 is a scaling factor which balances clean and robust errors. The constraint in Eq. (6) is of the essence and introduced to ensure that the two examples obtained in the inner optimization include one adversarial example and one collaborative example, considering it makes little sense to minimize the gap between two adversarial examples or between two collaborative examples. There are several different choices for the regularization function \u2113reg, e.g., the Jensen\u2013Shannon (JS) divergence, the squared l2 distance, and the symmetric KL divergence, which are formulated as follows: (1) JS: \u2113reg = 1 2 (KL( f(x\u2032) + f(x\u2032\u2032) 2 , f(x\u2032)) + KL( f(x\u2032) + f(x\u2032\u2032) 2 , f(x\u2032\u2032))), (2) (Squared) l2: \u2113reg = \u2225f(x\u2032)\u2212 f(x\u2032\u2032)\u222522, Algorithm 1 Squeeze Training (ST) Input: A set of benign example and their labels S, number of training iterations T , learning rate \u03b7, number of inner optimization steps K, perturbation budget \u03f5, step size \u03b1, and a choice of regularization function \u2113reg, Initialization: Perform random initialization for f , for t = 1, . . . , T do Sample a mini-batch of training data {(xi, y)}mi=1 for i = 1, . . . ,m (in parallel) do x\u2032i \u2190 xi + 0.001 \u00b7 N (0, I) , x\u2032\u2032i \u2190 xi + 0.001 \u00b7 N (0, I) while K \u2265 0 do xadvi \u2190 argmax x\u0303i\u2208{xi,x\u2032i,x\u2032\u2032i } CE(f(x\u0303i), yi) , xcoli \u2190 argmin x\u0303i\u2208{xi,x\u2032i,x\u2032\u2032i } CE(f(x\u0303i), yi) ginner = \u2113reg(f(x adv i ), f(x col i )) x\u2032i \u2190 \u03a0B\u03f5[xi](xadvi +\u03b1\u00b7sign(\u2207xadvi ginner)) , x \u2032\u2032 i \u2190 \u03a0B\u03f5[xi](xcoli +\u03b1\u00b7sign(\u2207xcoli ginner)) K \u2190 K \u2212 1 end while gi \u2190 CE(f(xi), yi) + \u03b2 \u00b7 \u2113reg(f(xadvi ), f(xcoli )) end for \u0398\u2190 \u0398\u2212 \u03b7 1m \u2211m i=1\u2207\u0398gi end for Output: A robust classifier f parameterized by \u0398. (3) Symmetric KL: \u2113reg = 1 2 (KL(f(x\u2032), f(x\u2032\u2032)) + KL(f(x\u2032\u2032), f(x\u2032))). Among these choices, the (squared) l2 and JS divergence are already symmetric, and we also adapt the original KL divergence to make it satisfy the symmetry axiom of desirable metrics, such that the adversarial examples and collaborative examples are treated equally. With the formulation in Eq. (6), pairs of collaborative and adversarial examples are obtained simultaneously, and the inner optimization are thus different from Eq. (1) and (4). The procedure can be implemented as in Algorithm 1, with modified PGD for achieving temporary results and consistent comparisons between prediction loss of the temporary results for guaranteeing chained inequality. 4.2 DISCUSSIONS We would like to first mention that, although Eq. (6) is partially inspired by TRADES, the collaborative examples can generally and naturally be introduced to other adversarial training formulations. Then, we compare Eq. (6) and TRADES carefully. We know that the latter regularizes KL divergence between benign examples and their neighboring data points. While, a neighboring data point that shows maximal KL divergence from the benign output, can be an adversarial example or a collaborative example actually. In Figure 5, we demonstrate the ratio of collaborative examples and the prediction loss of different examples along with the training using TRADES proceeds. It can be observed that the ratio of collaborative examples used for model optimization decreases consistently, and being always less than 50%. Our ST aims to use 100% of the collaborative and adversarial examples, if possible. Comparing with TRADES, the \u2113reg term in our ST imposes a stricter regularization, since the maximum possible output discrepancy between any two data points within the \u03f5-bounded neighborhood is penalized, which bounds the TRADES regularization from above. In this regard, the worst-case outputs (i.e., adversarial outputs) and the best-case outputs (collaborative outputs) are expected to be optimized jointly and equally. Moreover, as has been mentioned, since ST does not explicitly enforce the benign output probabilities to match the output of adversarial examples as in TRADES, we may expect improved trade-off between robust and clean accuracy. Extensive experimental comparison to TRADES in Section 5 will verify that our ST indeed outperforms it significantly, probably benefits from these merits. 5 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we compare the proposed ST to state-of-the-art methods. We mainly compare to vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020). Performance of other outstanding methods (Zhang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Kim et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022) will be compared in Section 5.3, as additional data may be used. Experiments are conducted on popular benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011). Table 1 summarizes our main results, with ResNet (He et al., 2016b). We also test with wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) to show that our method works as well on large-scale classification models, whose results can be found in Table 3 and 4. It is worth noting that our ST can be readily combined with many recent advances, e.g., AWP (Wu et al., 2020b) and RST (Carmon et al., 2019). AWP utilizes weight perturbation in addition to input perturbation. We can combine ST with it by replacing its learning objective with ours. RST uses unlabeled data to boost the performance of adversarial training. It first produces pseudo labels for unlabeled data, and then minimizes a regularization loss on both labeled and unlabeled data. Training settings. In most experiments in this section, we perform adversarial training with a perturbation budget of \u03f5 = 8/255 and an inner step size \u03b1 = 2/255, except for the SVHN dataset, where we use \u03b1 = 1/255. In the training phase, we always use an SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9, a weight decay of 0.0005, and a batch size of 128. We train ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016a) for 120 epochs on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and we adopt an initial learning rate of 0.1 and cut it by 10\u00d7 at the 80-th and 100-th epoch. For SVHN, we train ResNet-18 for 80 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.01, and we cut by 10\u00d7 at the 50-th and 65-th epoch. We adopt \u03b2 = 6 for TRADES and \u03b2 = 5 for MART by following their original papers. The final choice for the regularization function \u2113reg and the scaling factor \u03b2 in our ST will be given in Section 5.1. All models are trained on an NVIDIA Tesla-V100 GPU. Evaluation details. We evaluate the performance of adversarially trained models by computing their clean and robust accuracy. For robust accuracy, we perform various white-box attack methods including FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015), PGD (Madry et al., 2018), C&W\u2019s attack (Carlini & Wagner, 2017), and AutoAttack (AA) (Croce & Hein, 2020). Specifically, we perform PGD-20, PGD100, and C&W\u221e (i.e., the l\u221e version of C&W\u2019s loss optimized using PGD-100) under \u03f5 = 8/255 and \u03b1 = 2/255. Since adversarial training generally shows overfitting (Rice et al., 2020), we select the model with the best PGD-20 performance from all checkpoints, as suggested in many recent papers (Zhang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020; Gowal et al., 2021). 5.1 COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT DISCREPANCY METRICS: To get started, we compare the three choices of discrepancy metric for \u2113reg , e.g., the JS divergence, the squared l2 distance, and the symmetric KL divergence. In Figure 6, we summarize the performance of ST with these choices. We vary the scaling factor \u03b2 to demonstrate the trade-off between clean and robust accuracy, and the robust accuracy is evaluated using AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) which provides reliable evaluations. For a fair comparison, we also evaluate TRADES with the original KL divergence function being replaced with these newly introduced discrepancy functions and illustrate the results in the same plots (i.e., Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c)) correspondingly. The performance curve of the original TRADES is shown in every sub-figure (in grey). See Table 2 for all \u03b2 values in the figure. From Figure 6(a) to 6(c), one can see that considerably improved trade-off between the clean and robust accuracy is achieved by using our ST, in comparison to TRADES using the same discrepancy metric for measuring the gap between probability vectors. Moreover, in Figure 6(d), it can be seen that our ST with different choices for the discrepancy functions always outperforms the original TRADES by a large margin, and using the symmetric KL divergence for \u2113reg leads to the best performance overall. We will stick with the symmetric KL divergence for ST in our following comparison, and we use \u03b2 = 6 for CIFAR-10, \u03b2 = 4 for CIFAR-100, and \u03b2 = 8 for SVHN. 5.2 COMPARISON TO STATE-OF-THE-ARTS: Table 1 reports the performance of our adversarial training method ST and its competitors. Intensive results demonstrate that ST outperforms the vanilla AT (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020) significantly, gaining consistently higher clean and robust accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. In other words, our ST significantly enhances adversarial robustness with less degradation of clean accuracy, indicating better trade-off between clean and robust performance. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, the best prior method shows classification accuracy of 49.37% and 82.41%on the adversarial and clean test sets, respectively, while our ST with symmetric KL achieves 50.50% (+1.13%) and 83.10% (+0.69%). Combining with AWP (Wu et al., 2020b), we further gain an absolute improvement of 0.92% and 1.37% in robust and clean accuracy, respectively, compared to TRADES+AWP, on CIFAR-10. Similar observations can be made on CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Complexity analyses of our method is deferred to Appendix C, and training curves are given in Figure 8 to demonstrate less overfitting than that in Figure 4. In addition to the experiments on ResNet-18, we also employ larger-scale DNNs, i.e., wide ResNet (WRN) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). We train robust WRN models, including robust WRN-34-5 and robust WRN-34-10 on CIFAR-10, and we report their results in Table 3. Obviously, the WRN models lead to higher clean and robust accuracy than that of the ResNet-18. Importantly, our ST still outperforms competitors on these networks, showing that the effectiveness of our method holds when the size of DNN model scales. Another WRN, i.e., WRN28-10, is also tested and the same observations can be made. We will test with it carefully in Section 5.3, in which additional unlabeled data is utilized during training. 5.3 ADVERSARIAL TRAINING WITH ADDITIONAL UNLABELED DATA: RST (Carmon et al., 2019) is a recent work that confirms unlabeled data could also be properly incorporated into training for enhancing adversarial robustness. Here we consider a simple and direct combination with it. Recall that, in the RST paper, it extracted 500K unlabeled data from 80 Million Tiny Images (Torralba et al., 2008). To utilize these unlabeled images, it generates pseudo labels for them, then performs adversarial training on a set including all CIFAR-10 training images and the originally unlabeled data. Our ST can easily be incorporated after obtaining the pseudo labels. We implement RST and our combination with it (called ST-RST) by following settings in the original paper of RST. Table 4 report empirical results. We then compare the performance of ST-RST to recent work that utilizes the same set of unlabeled data, i.e., GAIR-RST (Zhang et al., 2020), AWP-RST (Wu et al., 2020b), BAT-RST (Kim et al., 2021), and RWPRST (Yu et al., 2022). Their results are collected from official implementations. For RWP-RST, which is in fact one of the best solutions in the same setting on RobustBench (Croce et al., 2020), it achieves robust accuracy of 60.36% by sacrificing clean accuracy, while our ST-RST gains +0.39% and +1.53% in robust and clean accuracy comparing to it. 6 CONCLUSION: In this paper, we have studied the loss landscape of DNN models (robust or not) and specifically paid more attention to the valley region of the landscapes where collaborative examples widely exist. We have verified that collaborative examples can be utilized to benefit adversarial robustness. In particular, we have proposed ST, a squeeze training method, to take both adversarial examples and collaborative examples into accounts, jointly and equally, for regularizing the loss landscape during DNN training, forming a novel regularization regime. Extensive experiments have shown that our ST outperforms current state-of-the-arts across different benchmark datasets and network architectures, and it can be combined with recent advances (including RST and AWP) to gain further progress in improving adversarial robustness. A PERFORMANCE OF MODELS IN FIGURE 1:  B COLLABORATIVE AND ADVERSARIAL DIRECTIONS: We analyze the angle between collaborative perturbations and PGD adversarial perturbations. We summarize the experiments in Figure 7 After a bunch of update steps, we observe that it lies in a limited range around 90\u25e6, which is unsurprising in the high dimensional input space. However, for more robust models, we see that the angle deviate more from 90\u25e6, indicating that powerful collaborative and adversarial perturbations become more correlated on the robust landscapes. C COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF ST: Since the adversarial examples and collaborative examples are both required in ST, the computational complexity in its inner optimization increases. Yet, we note that the two sorts of examples can be computed in parallel, thus the run time of our ST can be similar or only slightly higher than that of the baseline. Furthermore, the performance of previous state-of-the-arts does not in fact improve with higher computational capacity (e.g., more inner optimization steps). For instance, TRADES show slightly better robust accuracy (AA: 49.76%\u00b1 0.09%) but decreased clean accuracy (81.57%\u00b1 0.14%) on CIFAR-10 with 2\u00d7 more inner steps, which are both not better than our ST (AA: 50.50%\u00b1 0.07%, and clean accuracy: 83.10%\u00b1 0.10%). D TRAINING CURVES OF ST:  E TO MAKE \u201cADVERSARIAL\u201d AND \u201cCOLLABORATIVE\u201d CLEAR: In this paper, we generalize the definition of adversarial examples to include all data points (in the bounded neighborhood of benign examples) showing considerable higher prediction loss than that of the benign loss, in contrast to the definition in a narrower sense saying that different label prediction ought to be made. The collaborative examples are similarly \u201cdefined\u201d, somewhat non-rigorously. Throughout the paper, we use the word \u201cadversarial\u201d and \u201ccollaborative\u201d to indicate perturbed data points with considerable higher and lower loss than the benign loss, respectively.

Are all terms and parameters well-defined?\\n    *   **Assumptions:** What assumptions does ST make about the data, model, or attack space? Are these assumptions reasonable and stated explicitly?\\n\\n2.  **Theoretical Justification (if any):**\\n    *   **Proofs/Guarantees:** Does the paper offer any theoretical guarantees regarding robustness, generalization, or convergence? Even partial proofs or theoretical insights into why \\\"squeezing\\\" might work are valuable.\\n    *   **Connections to Existing Theory:** Does ST draw upon or extend existing theories of adversarial robustness (e.g., Lipschitz continuity, robustness to input perturbations, manifold learning)?\\n\\n3.  **Implementation Details:**\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Are the algorithms and training procedures described with sufficient detail for independent reproduction? This includes hyperparameters, optimizers, learning rate schedules, and any specific architectural modifications.\\n    *   **Computational Complexity:** How does ST compare to standard training or other adversarial training methods (e.g., PGD-AT, TRADES) in terms of computational cost (FLOPs, memory, training time)?\\n\\n4.  **Potential Technical Flaws:**\\n    *   **Gradient Stability:** Does the \\\"squeezing\\\" operation introduce vanishing/exploding gradients or make training unstable?\\n    *   **Overfitting to Specific Attacks:** Does it inadvertently cause the model to overfit to the specific \\\"squeezing\\\" mechanism or attack used during training, rather than generalize robustness?\\n    *   **Numerical Stability:** Are there any operations that could lead to numerical instability (e.g., division by small numbers, very large/small values)?\\n\\n### II.

Similarly, \\\"Squeeze Training\\\" generally refers to techniques like quantization or low-precision training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Analysis of the Loss Landscape\\n\\n**General Principles:** The loss landscape refers to the mapping from the model's parameters to the loss function value. Analyzing it aims to understand how various properties (e.g., curvature, flatness, number of minima) relate to training dynamics, generalization, and robustness.\\n\\n**Evaluation Criteria & Insights:**\\n\\n*   **Sharpness vs. Flatness:** A central hypothesis is that \\\"flat\\\" minima generalize better than \\\"sharp\\\" ones. A sharp minimum means that small perturbations in the parameters lead to a significant increase in loss, implying fragility. A flat minimum is robust to such perturbations.\\n    *   **Metrics:** A robust analysis should quantify \\\"sharpness\\\" using metrics like:\\n        *   **Largest Eigenvalue of the Hessian:** A large eigenvalue indicates sharp curvature in that direction.\\n        *   **Trace of the Hessian:** Sum of eigenvalues, another indicator of overall curvature.\\n        *   **PAC-Bayes Bounds:** These theoretical bounds often link flatter minima (which imply a larger volume of parameter space leading to low error) to better generalization.\\n    *   **Visualization:** While difficult in high dimensions, 1D or 2D slices or projections are often used to illustrate flatness.\\n    *   **Challenges:** High dimensionality makes a complete analysis intractable. Most analyses rely on local approximations or specific slices. The definition of \\\"flatness\\\" itself can be tricky (e.g., reparameterization invariance).\\n\\n*   **Quality of Analysis:**\\n    *   **Sound:** An analysis is sound if it clearly defines its metrics for flatness/sharpness, demonstrates a consistent correlation between these metrics and observed generalization/robustness, and ideally provides theoretical backing (e.g., linking flatness to tighter generalization bounds).\\n    *   **Weak:** An analysis is weak if it relies on qualitative descriptions without clear metrics, provides anecdotal evidence, or fails to connect the landscape properties to actual model behavior convincingly.\\n\\n**Conclusion for Loss Landscape Analysis:** A rigorous analysis must move beyond intuition and employ quantifiable metrics to characterize the landscape, linking these characteristics empirically and, ideally, theoretically to model performance (generalization, robustness).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Concept of \\\"Collaborative Examples\\\"\\n\\nThis term is novel and requires definition. Assuming it's being introduced as a complement or contrast to \\\"adversarial examples,\\\" here are potential interpretations and an evaluation:\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\n*   **Interpretation 1: Non-Adversarial, Generalization-Promoting Examples:** Perhaps \\\"collaborative examples\\\" refers to a set of examples that, when used together (e.g., in a mini-batch or a curriculum), *harmoniously* guide the model towards a better, more generalizable solution, possibly by emphasizing shared features or reducing conflicting gradients. This would be in contrast to adversarial examples, which are *designed* to break the model.\\n    *   **Evaluation:** If this is the case, the concept is intuitive but vague. How are these examples generated or identified? Is it simply \\\"good training data\\\"? Or does it imply a specific *method* of selecting or augmenting data that promotes desired landscape properties?\\n*   **Interpretation 2: Multi-Instance Adversarial/Co-occurrence Exploitation:** Less likely, but perhaps \\\"collaborative\\\" refers to how *multiple inputs* taken together (even if individually benign) can collectively reveal vulnerabilities or reinforce certain (undesirable) behaviors. This might be relevant in sequence models or graph neural networks where relationships between data points are explicit.\\n    *   **Evaluation:** This would be a more complex, potentially interesting avenue, but would require a clear formalism for how examples \\\"collaborate\\\" to affect the model.\\n*   **Interpretation 3: Examples Enhancing Shared Representations:** \\\"Collaborative examples\\\" could be data points that particularly help the network learn robust, shared, and separable features across classes, thereby contributing to a better-structured latent space that promotes flatter minima.\\n\\n**Overall Evaluation of \\\"Collaborative Examples\\\":**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Soundness:** Without a concrete definition, the theoretical soundness is impossible to assess.\\n    *   If it refers to a *method* of data selection or augmentation, its soundness would depend on how that method is justified (e.g., information theory, optimal transport, manifold learning).\\n    *   If it refers to a *property* of data, it needs a rigorous mathematical formulation (e.g., how examples \\\"collaborate\\\" to influence the loss landscape).\\n*   **Impact:** The concept *could* be impactful if it introduces a novel framework for data augmentation, curriculum learning, or understanding model vulnerabilities that go beyond single-point perturbations. However, its current ambiguity makes it challenging to evaluate its potential.\\n\\n**Conclusion for Collaborative Examples:** The term needs precise definition. Its value hinges entirely on a clear articulation of what constitutes a \\\"collaborative example\\\" and how it mechanistically influences the loss landscape or model behavior. Without this, it remains an underdeveloped concept.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Justification for Using Squeeze Training (ST) to Regularize the Loss Landscape\\n\\nAssuming \\\"Squeeze Training\\\" refers to techniques like **quantization (reducing precision of weights/activations), pruning (removing connections), or other forms of model compression**, the justification for its role in regularizing the loss landscape is often based on the following:\\n\\n**Mechanism of Regularization by ST:**\\n\\n1.  **Noise Injection / Stochasticity:**\\n    *   **Quantization:** The act of snapping parameters (weights, activations) to discrete values during training (or converting them back and forth) introduces a form of noise or stochasticity into the optimization process. This noise can prevent the optimizer from settling into sharp, brittle minima. Analogous to how SGD's inherent noise helps it find flatter minima.\\n    *   **Weight Perturbations:** Quantization means the model must be robust to the *quantization error* \u2013 the difference between the full-precision value and its quantized counterpart. If the model's performance is sensitive to such small changes (i.e., it's in a sharp minimum), it will perform poorly after quantization. Thus, successful quantized models implicitly inhabit flatter regions of the landscape.\\n\\n2.  **Implicit Capacity Control:**\\n    *   **Quantization/Pruning:** By reducing the precision of parameters or removing connections, ST effectively reduces the model's effective capacity. A reduced capacity often leads to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting and, consequently, might gravitate towards flatter, more generalizable minima. This acts as an implicit regularization similar to explicit L1/L2 penalties.\\n\\n3.  **Encouraging Robustness to Parameter Perturbations:**\\n    *   If a model successfully retains performance after being \\\"squeezed\\\" (e.g., quantized), it implies that its decision boundaries and internal representations are not overly sensitive to small changes in its parameters. This insensitivity is a hallmark of flat minima. ST, by forcing this robustness, guides the training process towards such regions.\\n\\n**Justification's Soundness:**\\n\\n*   **Plausible:** The idea that introducing constraints or noise during training can regularize the loss landscape is highly plausible and supported by empirical evidence (e.g., dropout, batch normalization, SGD itself).\\n*   **Theoretical Links:**\\n    *   **Information Theory:** Lower precision weights might correspond to models that encode less \\\"information\\\" in their parameters, potentially leading to simpler, more generalizable functions.\\n    *   **Generalization Bounds:** Some generalization bounds (e.g., PAC-Bayes) are related to the \\\"volume\\\" of parameter space consistent with low training error. Flat minima correspond to larger such volumes, and techniques like quantization could implicitly select for these.\\n    *   **Optimization Dynamics:** The stochastic nature introduced by quantization can be analyzed through the lens of stochastic optimization, where noise can help escape sharp valleys.\\n\\n**Conclusion for ST Justification:** The justification for ST as a regularizer, particularly through quantization, is conceptually sound and aligns with existing understanding of optimization and generalization. It proposes a clear mechanism (noise injection, implicit capacity control, forcing robustness) that can plausibly lead to flatter minima.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Assessment of Theoretical Soundness of the Overall Approach\\n\\nThe overall theoretical soundness hinges critically on the clarity and rigor of the \\\"collaborative examples\\\" concept.\\n\\n*   **If \\\"Collaborative Examples\\\" is Vague/Undefined:** The overall approach lacks theoretical coherence. You have a solid understanding of loss landscape analysis and a plausible justification for ST, but the \\\"collaborative examples\\\" component remains an unconnected, undefined element. The \\\"approach\\\" isn't a unified theory but a collection of loosely associated ideas.\\n*   **If \\\"Collaborative Examples\\\" is Rigorously Defined:**\\n    *   **Strong Linkages:** If \\\"collaborative examples\\\" are defined as, for instance, data points that collectively regularize the feature space in a way that *promotes flatter minima* in conjunction with ST, then the theoretical soundness increases significantly.\\n    *   **Potential for Novelty:** This could involve formalizing how certain data properties (collaborative examples) combined with a specific training regularization (ST) jointly influence the geometry of the loss landscape.\\n    *   **Example Linkages:**\\n        *   Could \\\"collaborative examples\\\" be designed to specifically *test* the model's robustness to quantization noise, thus guiding ST more effectively?\\n        *   Could they be a form of data augmentation that forces the model to learn features that are inherently robust to the precision constraints imposed by ST?\\n\\n**Overall Theoretical Soundness:** Currently, the most significant theoretical gap is the definition and mechanism of \\\"collaborative examples.\\\" The understanding of the loss landscape and the regularization effect of Squeeze Training are relatively well-understood concepts that *could* be integrated into a cohesive theory. The soundness depends entirely on how the novel \\\"collaborative examples\\\" concept is formalized and how it theoretically interacts with the loss landscape and ST. Without this, it's a piecewise, not a unified, theory.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Potential Impact on the Understanding of Deep Neural Networks\\n\\n*   **Novel Regularization Pathways:** If the \\\"collaborative examples\\\" concept can be formalized and shown to work synergistically with ST, it could open up a new class of regularization techniques. Instead of just penalizing weight magnitudes (L1/L2) or injecting dropout noise, we might explicitly design data (collaborative examples) and training methods (ST) to sculpt the loss landscape in a desired way.\\n*   **Bridging Efficiency and Theory:** ST, especially in the context of quantization, is primarily an efficiency technique. Demonstrating its deep connection to loss landscape regularization provides a stronger theoretical underpinning for *why* quantized models can generalize well, moving beyond just empirical observation. This could drive the development of \\\"theoretically justified efficient models.\\\"\\n*   **Deeper Insights into Generalization and Robustness:** Understanding how specific data patterns (\\\"collaborative examples\\\") interact with parameter constraints (ST) to shape the loss landscape provides a more granular view of generalization. It moves beyond just \\\"more data\\\" or \\\"larger models\\\" to a focus on the *quality* of data interactions and the *type* of parameter space the model occupies.\\n*   **Beyond Adversarial Examples:** If \\\"collaborative examples\\\" define a new class of data interaction, it could expand our understanding of model vulnerabilities and strengths beyond the current focus on single-input adversarial perturbations.\\n*   **Framework for Future Research:** The approach could inspire research into:\\n    *   Algorithms for generating \\\"collaborative examples.\\\"\\n    *   New ST variants specifically designed to exploit landscape properties.\\n    *   Theoretical bounds that incorporate data-level interaction and parameter precision.\\n\\n**Potential Challenges/Limitations to Impact:**\\n\\n*   **Scalability:** Generating/identifying \\\"collaborative examples\\\" might be computationally intensive for large datasets.\\n*   **Generalizability:** Will the principles apply universally across different architectures and tasks?\\n*   **Interpretability:** The interaction between data properties and landscape geometry can be complex to interpret.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe proposed analysis brings together two established concepts (loss landscape analysis and Squeeze Training as regularization) with a novel, but currently undefined, concept (\\\"collaborative examples\\\").\\n\\n*   **Loss Landscape Analysis:** Essential for understanding model behavior, and its evaluation relies on rigorous metrics (Hessian, eigenvalues) and empirical correlation with performance.\\n*   **Collaborative Examples:** This is the *critical missing piece*. Its theoretical soundness and potential impact are entirely contingent on a precise, formal definition of what constitutes such an example and how it mechanistically influences the model or the landscape. Without this, it's a speculative concept.\\n*   **Squeeze Training Justification:** The argument for ST (assuming quantization/compression) as a regularizer is conceptually strong, leveraging ideas of noise injection, implicit capacity control, and forced robustness, leading to flatter minima.\\n\\n**Overall, the theoretical soundness of the *entire approach* is currently limited by the ambiguity of \\\"collaborative examples.\\\"** If this concept can be concretely defined and rigorously linked to the loss landscape and ST, the approach has the **potential for significant impact** by:\\n1.  Offering novel regularization strategies that integrate data properties with training methods.\\n2.  Providing deeper theoretical insights into *why* efficient models generalize well.\\n3.

The core idea is that the smaller teacher, despite its limited capacity, can capture robust and generalizable features, which it then \\\"squeezes\\\" into the more complex student, helping it converge faster, more stably, and often achieve higher accuracy than training the student from scratch.\\n\\nLet's evaluate its practical aspects, implementation, complexity, generalization, and offer suggestions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of Squeeze Training (ST)\\n\\n#### 1. Practical Aspects\\n\\n*   **Advantages:**\\n    *   **Improved Convergence:** The student model often converges faster and more stably, especially for very deep or complex architectures prone to vanishing/exploding gradients or local minima. The teacher's \\\"soft targets\\\" provide a richer training signal than hard labels alone.\\n    *   **Higher Accuracy:** Can lead to better final performance for the student model by acting as a strong regularization technique, guiding the student to learn more generalizable features.\\n    *   **Reduced Training Time (Overall):** While it adds an initial teacher training phase, the student might require fewer epochs or less hyperparameter tuning to reach desired performance, potentially saving total wall-clock time.\\n    *   **Robustness:** The smaller teacher might implicitly learn simpler, more robust features, transferring this robustness to the student.\\n    *   **Leveraging Existing Models:** If a good small model already exists for a task (e.g., a MobileNet for object detection), it can be effectively used as a teacher for a larger model (e.g., a ResNet or EfficientNet).\\n\\n*   **Disadvantages:**\\n    *   **Increased Complexity:** Requires managing two models (teacher and student), defining a distillation loss, and tuning additional hyperparameters (temperature, distillation loss weight).\\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimal values for distillation temperature ($T$), the weighting factor ($\\\\alpha$) between distillation loss and cross-entropy loss, and the teacher training schedule can be challenging to find.\\n    *   **Teacher Performance Critical:** The quality of the teacher model significantly impacts the student's performance. A poorly trained or unsuitable teacher can hurt the student.\\n    *   **Memory Footprint:** During student training, both the teacher and student models need to be in memory simultaneously for forward passes, increasing GPU memory requirements.\\n\\n#### 2. Implementation Details\\n\\nImplementing Squeeze Training typically involves:\\n\\n1.  **Teacher Model Selection & Training:**\\n    *   **Choose a Teacher Architecture:** Select a model that is significantly smaller than the student but known to perform reasonably well on the task (e.g., ResNet-18 as teacher for ResNet-50).\\n    *   **Train the Teacher:** Train the teacher model on the target dataset until it achieves good performance. This can be done independently. For best results, use standard training practices (optimizer, learning rate schedule, data augmentation).\\n\\n2.  **Student Model Initialization:**\\n    *   **Choose a Student Architecture:** The larger model you want to train.\\n    *   **Initialization:** The student can be initialized from scratch or using pre-trained weights (e.g., ImageNet pre-training) for its own architecture.\\n\\n3.  **Distillation Loss Integration:**\\n    *   **Combined Loss Function:** The total loss for the student is usually a weighted sum of the standard cross-entropy loss (comparing student predictions to true labels) and the distillation loss (comparing student logits to teacher logits).\\n        $L_{total} = (1 - \\\\alpha) \\\\cdot L_{CE}(y_{student}, y_{true}) + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot L_{KD}(y_{student}, y_{teacher})$\\n    *   **Knowledge Distillation (KD) Loss:** The most common form is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between the softened student and teacher probability distributions.\\n        *   **Softmax with Temperature:** Probabilities are computed as $P_i = \\\\exp(z_i/T) / \\\\sum_j \\\\exp(z_j/T)$, where $z_i$ are logits and $T$ is the temperature. A higher $T$ produces softer (more uniform) distributions, revealing more relational information between classes.\\n        *   **KL Divergence:** $L_{KD} = \\\\sum_i P_{teacher}(i) \\\\log \\\\frac{P_{teacher}(i)}{P_{student}(i)}$. Often, $L_{KD}$ is scaled by $T^2$ to maintain the relative magnitude of gradients, as proposed in Hinton et al. (2015).\\n    *   **Teacher Mode:** During student training, the teacher model is typically set to `eval()` mode and its gradients are frozen (`torch.no_grad()`). Only the student's weights are updated.\\n\\n4.  **Training Loop:**\\n    *   For each batch:\\n        *   Perform forward pass with the teacher model to get teacher logits. (No gradient computation here)\\n        *   Perform forward pass with the student model to get student logits.\\n        *   Calculate $L_{CE}$ using student logits and true labels.\\n        *   Calculate $L_{KD}$ using softened student and teacher logits.\\n        *   Calculate $L_{total}$.\\n        *   Backpropagate $L_{total}$ through the student model and update its weights.\\n\\n#### 3. Computational Complexity\\n\\n*   **Teacher Training:** This is an *additional* up-front cost. Its magnitude depends on the teacher's size and the dataset. For many applications, this is relatively quick due to the teacher being small.\\n*   **Student Training (with distillation):**\\n    *   **Forward Pass:** Requires running *two* forward passes (one for teacher, one for student) per mini-batch. Since the teacher is smaller, its forward pass is significantly faster than the student's, but it's still an overhead.\\n    *   **Backward Pass:** Only the student model's parameters are updated, so the backward pass complexity is roughly the same as training the student alone (plus the gradient computation for the combined loss function, which is negligible).\\n    *   **Memory Usage:** This is the most significant increase. Both the teacher and student models, along with their intermediate activations, must reside in GPU memory simultaneously during the student's training phase. This can significantly limit the maximum batch size that can be used.\\n*   **Overall:** ST adds computational cost compared to training the student alone. However, this cost can be justified if it leads to faster convergence (fewer epochs), better final performance, or more stable training, ultimately saving *total research time* or achieving a better model.\\n\\n#### 4. Potential for Generalization to Different Datasets and Network Architectures\\n\\n*   **Datasets:**\\n    *   **High Potential:** Squeeze Training, like general knowledge distillation, is highly generalizable across various datasets. It has been successfully applied to image classification (ImageNet, CIFAR, etc.), object detection, segmentation, and natural language processing tasks.\\n    *   **Benefits for Complex Datasets:** It can be particularly beneficial for large, complex datasets where training very deep models from scratch is challenging (e.g., ImageNet-scale, medical imaging datasets with high resolution and complex patterns). The teacher can help guide the student through the intricate data landscape.\\n\\n*   **Network Architectures:**\\n    *   **High Potential:** The concept is highly flexible regarding architecture choices.\\n    *   **Teacher:** Can be any smaller, well-performing model. Examples include MobileNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet-B0/B1, smaller ResNets (ResNet-18, 34), or even compact custom architectures.\\n    *   **Student:** Can be any larger model, often a larger version of the same family (e.g., ResNet-50/101, EfficientNet-B5/B7) or a completely different, more powerful architecture.\\n    *   **Compatibility:** The primary requirement is that the models produce comparable outputs (e.g., logits for classification, feature maps for feature-level distillation). For classification, only the final logit layer needs to be compatible in terms of number of classes. For other tasks, feature map sizes might need to align if using feature-level distillation.\\n    *   **Cross-Architecture Distillation:** ST excels here. A teacher from one family (e.g., MobileNet) can guide a student from another (e.g., Vision Transformer), as long as the output interface for distillation is consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Practical Suggestions for Improving the Training Process and Reducing Computational Cost\\n\\n#### A. Teacher-Centric Optimizations\\n\\n1.  **Choose the Smallest Effective Teacher:** Don't pick a teacher that's overly complex. The goal is a *competent* guide, not a perfect one. Simpler teachers train faster and have less inference overhead during student training.\\n2.  **Pre-train Teacher on Larger Datasets (if available):** If your target dataset is a subset or specific domain, pre-training the teacher on a larger, more general dataset (e.g., ImageNet for vision tasks) can significantly improve its quality and reduce the training time needed on your specific dataset.\\n3.  **Teacher Pruning/Quantization (for inference):** While the teacher isn't deployed, its forward pass during student training still consumes resources. If the teacher is large, consider applying quantization or pruning to the *teacher model only* for its forward passes during student training, if your framework supports it seamlessly without affecting numerical stability. (This is less common but theoretically possible).\\n4.  **Teacher Epochs:** Monitor teacher performance. Stop training the teacher once its validation performance plateaus; overtraining the teacher offers diminishing returns and wastes time.\\n\\n#### B. Student Training (with Distillation) Optimizations\\n\\n1.  **Freeze Teacher Parameters and Set to Evaluation Mode:** Crucially, during student training, the teacher model should be set to `model.eval()` and its gradients explicitly disabled (`with torch.no_grad():` or `teacher_model.requires_grad_(False)`). This significantly speeds up its forward pass and prevents unnecessary memory allocation for gradients.\\n2.  **Gradual Distillation Warm-up:**\\n    *   **Initial Pure CE:** Start the student training with only the standard cross-entropy loss for a few epochs. This allows the student to learn basic features from hard labels without being immediately constrained by the teacher.\\n    *   **Gradual Introduction:** Slowly increase the $\\\\alpha$ (distillation loss weight) over a few epochs, from 0 to its target value. This prevents early confusion or gradient instability.\\n3.  **Dynamic Temperature Scheduling:** Experiment with a fixed temperature $T$ (common values are 2-10). Some research suggests annealing $T$ over time, starting high and decreasing, or vice-versa. This is highly problem-dependent.\\n4.  **Targeted Knowledge Transfer:**\\n    *   **Logit Distillation (Standard):** Most common and computationally efficient. Only requires the final layer's output.\\n    *   **Feature Map Distillation:** Transfer knowledge from intermediate layers (e.g., matching feature maps after a specific block). This can provide a richer signal but increases computational complexity (more element-wise operations) and memory usage (more feature maps to store). Use sparingly and strategically.\\n    *   **Attention Map Distillation:** For transformer models, transferring attention patterns can be effective.\\n5.  **Memory Management:**\\n    *   **Reduce Batch Size:** If GPU memory is an issue due to two models, reduce the batch size. Use gradient accumulation to simulate larger effective batch sizes if needed.\\n    *   **Checkpoints:** If student is extremely large, use gradient checkpointing (activation checkpointing) to trade compute for memory.\\n\\n#### C. General Training Optimizations\\n\\n1.  **Efficient Hardware:** Use GPUs with sufficient VRAM. Modern training often benefits from high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\\n2.  **Profiling:** Use profiling tools (e.g., `nvprof`, PyTorch's profiler) to identify bottlenecks in your training loop.\\n3.  **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Tools like Optuna, Ray Tune, or Weights & Biases Sweeps can automate the search for optimal $\\\\alpha$, $T$, learning rates, and warm-up schedules, significantly reducing manual tuning time.\\n4.  **Early Stopping:** Implement early stopping based on validation set performance to prevent overfitting and avoid unnecessary training epochs for the student. This saves significant computational cost in the long run.\\n5.  **Distributed Training (if student is very large):** Standard distributed data parallel (DDP) can still be used for the student model, but the teacher forward pass would still run on each GPU, adding overhead. Model parallelism might be needed for extremely large students.\\n\\nBy carefully considering these practical aspects and applying the suggested optimizations, Squeeze Training can be a highly effective strategy for training high-performance deep learning models more efficiently and robustly.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.8602351\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the practical aspects of Squeeze Training (ST), its implementation details, its computational complexity, and its potential for generalization to different datasets and network architectures.

Effectiveness in Improving Adversarial Robustness\\n\\n1.  **Robust Accuracy:**\\n    *   **Benchmark Datasets:** How well does the model trained with ST perform on standard adversarial robustness benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) against various attacks?\\n    *   **Attack Sophistication:** Evaluation against strong, adaptive attacks is crucial.\\n        *   **White-box attacks:** PGD (multi-step, varying step size and number of steps), CW (L2 and L-infinity), AutoAttack (essential for reliable evaluation, as it combines multiple strong attacks like APGD-CE, APGD-DIF, FAB, Square Attack).\\n        *   **Black-box attacks:** Transfer-based attacks, query-based attacks (e.g., NES, SPSA), score-based attacks (e.g., ZOO).\\n    *   **Robustness vs. Clean Accuracy Trade-off:** How much does ST sacrifice clean accuracy for robustness? A good robust method minimizes this trade-off.\\n    *   **Attack Budget ($\\\\epsilon$):** Performance should be evaluated across a range of perturbation budgets ($\\\\epsilon$) to understand its robustness profile.\\n\\n2.  **Generalization of Robustness:**\\n    *   **Unseen Attacks:** Does the model remain robust against attacks not used during training? (This is implicitly tested by AutoAttack).\\n    *   **Transferability of Attacks:** Are adversarial examples generated on the ST-trained model less transferable to other models, and vice-versa?\\n    *   **Defense Against Other Defenses:** Does ST strengthen the model against \"defense-aware\" attacks (i.e., attacks that know the model was trained with ST)?\\n\\n3.  **Efficiency and Scalability:**\\n    *   **Training Time:** How much longer does ST take to train compared to standard training or other robust methods?\\n    *   **Inference Time:** Does ST impact inference time?

Does it modify the input, feature space, or loss?\\n*   **Effectiveness:** Does \"squeezing\" on the fly make the model more resistant to a wider range of perturbations or just to perturbations that are easily mitigated by the squeezing operation itself?\\n*   **Evaluation:** Crucially, it must be evaluated against *adaptive attacks* that are aware of the squeezing operation and can potentially bypass it.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.86253685}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Evaluating an analysis of the loss landscape, the concept of \"collaborative examples,\" and the justification for Squeeze Training (ST) as a regularization method requires addressing each component individually, then assessing their collective theoretical soundness and potential impact.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the term \"collaborative examples\" is not a standard, widely recognized term in the deep learning literature in the same vein as \"adversarial examples.\" Therefore, my evaluation of this concept will necessarily assume a potential meaning or highlight the need for a clear definition. Similarly, \"Squeeze Training\" generally refers to techniques like quantization or low-precision training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Analysis of the Loss Landscape\\n\\n**General Principles:** The loss landscape refers to the mapping from the model\\'s parameters to the loss function value. Analyzing it aims to understand how various properties (e.g., curvature, flatness, number of minima) relate to training dynamics, generalization, and robustness.\\n\\n**Evaluation Criteria & Insights:**\\n\\n*   **Sharpness vs. Flatness:** A central hypothesis is that \"flat\" minima generalize better than \"sharp\" ones. A sharp minimum means that small perturbations in the parameters lead to a significant increase in loss, implying fragility. A flat minimum is robust to such perturbations.\\n    *   **Metrics:** A robust analysis should quantify \"sharpness\" using metrics like:\\n        *   **Largest Eigenvalue of the Hessian:** A large eigenvalue indicates sharp curvature in that direction.\\n        *   **Trace of the Hessian:** Sum of eigenvalues, another indicator of overall curvature.\\n        *   **PAC-Bayes Bounds:** These theoretical bounds often link flatter minima (which imply a larger volume of parameter space leading to low error) to better generalization.\\n    *   **Visualization:** While difficult in high dimensions, 1D or 2D slices or projections are often used to illustrate flatness.\\n    *   **Challenges:** High dimensionality makes a complete analysis intractable. Most analyses rely on local approximations or specific slices. The definition of \"flatness\" itself can be tricky (e.g., reparameterization invariance).\\n\\n*   **Quality of Analysis:**\\n    *   **Sound:** An analysis is sound if it clearly defines its metrics for flatness/sharpness, demonstrates a consistent correlation between these metrics and observed generalization/robustness, and ideally provides theoretical backing (e.g., linking flatness to tighter generalization bounds).\\n    *   **Weak:** An analysis is weak if it relies on qualitative descriptions without clear metrics, provides anecdotal evidence, or fails to connect the landscape properties to actual model behavior convincingly.\\n\\n**Conclusion for Loss Landscape Analysis:** A rigorous analysis must move beyond intuition and employ quantifiable metrics to characterize the landscape, linking these characteristics empirically and, ideally, theoretically to model performance (generalization, robustness).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Concept of \"Collaborative Examples\"\\n\\nThis term is novel and requires definition. Assuming it\\'s being introduced as a complement or contrast to \"adversarial examples,\" here are potential interpretations and an evaluation:\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\n*   **Interpretation 1: Non-Adversarial, Generalization-Promoting Examples:** Perhaps \"collaborative examples\" refers to a set of examples that, when used together (e.g., in a mini-batch or a curriculum), *harmoniously* guide the model towards a better, more generalizable solution, possibly by emphasizing shared features or reducing conflicting gradients. This would be in contrast to adversarial examples, which are *designed* to break the model.\\n    *   **Evaluation:** If this is the case, the concept is intuitive but vague. How are these examples generated or identified? Is it simply \"good training data\"? Or does it imply a specific *method* of selecting or augmenting data that promotes desired landscape properties?\\n*   **Interpretation 2: Multi-Instance Adversarial/Co-occurrence Exploitation:** Less likely, but perhaps \"collaborative\" refers to how *multiple inputs* taken together (even if individually benign) can collectively reveal vulnerabilities or reinforce certain (undesirable) behaviors. This might be relevant in sequence models or graph neural networks where relationships between data points are explicit.\\n    *   **Evaluation:** This would be a more complex, potentially interesting avenue, but would require a clear formalism for how examples \"collaborate\" to affect the model.\\n*   **Interpretation 3: Examples Enhancing Shared Representations:** \"Collaborative examples\" could be data points that particularly help the network learn robust, shared, and separable features across classes, thereby contributing to a better-structured latent space that promotes flatter minima.\\n\\n**Overall Evaluation of \"Collaborative Examples\":**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Soundness:** Without a concrete definition, the theoretical soundness is impossible to assess.\\n    *   If it refers to a *method* of data selection or augmentation, its soundness would depend on how that method is justified (e.g., information theory, optimal transport, manifold learning).\\n    *   If it refers to a *property* of data, it needs a rigorous mathematical formulation (e.g., how examples \"collaborate\" to influence the loss landscape).\\n*   **Impact:** The concept *could* be impactful if it introduces a novel framework for data augmentation, curriculum learning, or understanding model vulnerabilities that go beyond single-point perturbations. However, its current ambiguity makes it challenging to evaluate its potential.\\n\\n**Conclusion for Collaborative Examples:** The term needs precise definition. Its value hinges entirely on a clear articulation of what constitutes a \"collaborative example\" and how it mechanistically influences the loss landscape or model behavior. Without this, it remains an underdeveloped concept.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Justification for Using Squeeze Training (ST) to Regularize the Loss Landscape\\n\\nAssuming \"Squeeze Training\" refers to techniques like **quantization (reducing precision of weights/activations), pruning (removing connections), or other forms of model compression**, the justification for its role in regularizing the loss landscape is often based on the following:\\n\\n**Mechanism of Regularization by ST:**\\n\\n1.  **Noise Injection / Stochasticity:**\\n    *   **Quantization:** The act of snapping parameters (weights, activations) to discrete values during training (or converting them back and forth) introduces a form of noise or stochasticity into the optimization process. This noise can prevent the optimizer from settling into sharp, brittle minima. Analogous to how SGD\\'s inherent noise helps it find flatter minima.\\n    *   **Weight Perturbations:** Quantization means the model must be robust to the *quantization error* \u2013 the difference between the full-precision value and its quantized counterpart. If the model\\'s performance is sensitive to such small changes (i.e., it\\'s in a sharp minimum), it will perform poorly after quantization. Thus, successful quantized models implicitly inhabit flatter regions of the landscape.\\n\\n2.  **Implicit Capacity Control:**\\n    *   **Quantization/Pruning:** By reducing the precision of parameters or removing connections, ST effectively reduces the model\\'s effective capacity. A reduced capacity often leads to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting and, consequently, might gravitate towards flatter, more generalizable minima. This acts as an implicit regularization similar to explicit L1/L2 penalties.\\n\\n3.  **Encouraging Robustness to Parameter Perturbations:**\\n    *   If a model successfully retains performance after being \"squeezed\" (e.g., quantized), it implies that its decision boundaries and internal representations are not overly sensitive to small changes in its parameters. This insensitivity is a hallmark of flat minima. ST, by forcing this robustness, guides the training process towards such regions.\\n\\n**Justification\\'s Soundness:**\\n\\n*   **Plausible:** The idea that introducing constraints or noise during training can regularize the loss landscape is highly plausible and supported by empirical evidence (e.g., dropout, batch normalization, SGD itself).\\n*   **Theoretical Links:**\\n    *   **Information Theory:** Lower precision weights might correspond to models that encode less \"information\" in their parameters, potentially leading to simpler, more generalizable functions.\\n    *   **Generalization Bounds:** Some generalization bounds (e.g., PAC-Bayes) are related to the \"volume\" of parameter space consistent with low training error. Flat minima correspond to larger such volumes, and techniques like quantization could implicitly select for these.\\n    *   **Optimization Dynamics:** The stochastic nature introduced by quantization can be analyzed through the lens of stochastic optimization, where noise can help escape sharp valleys.\\n\\n**Conclusion for ST Justification:** The justification for ST as a regularizer, particularly through quantization, is conceptually sound and aligns with existing understanding of optimization and generalization. It proposes a clear mechanism (noise injection, implicit capacity control, forcing robustness) that can plausibly lead to flatter minima.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Assessment of Theoretical Soundness of the Overall Approach\\n\\nThe overall theoretical soundness hinges critically on the clarity and rigor of the \"collaborative examples\" concept.\\n\\n*   **If \"Collaborative Examples\" is Vague/Undefined:** The overall approach lacks theoretical coherence. You have a solid understanding of loss landscape analysis and a plausible justification for ST, but the \"collaborative examples\" component remains an unconnected, undefined element. The \"approach\" isn\\'t a unified theory but a collection of loosely associated ideas.\\n*   **If \"Collaborative Examples\" is Rigorously Defined:**\\n    *   **Strong Linkages:** If \"collaborative examples\" are defined as, for instance, data points that collectively regularize the feature space in a way that *promotes flatter minima* in conjunction with ST, then the theoretical soundness increases significantly.\\n    *   **Potential for Novelty:** This could involve formalizing how certain data properties (collaborative examples) combined with a specific training regularization (ST) jointly influence the geometry of the loss landscape.\\n    *   **Example Linkages:**\\n        *   Could \"collaborative examples\" be designed to specifically *test* the model\\'s robustness to quantization noise, thus guiding ST more effectively?\\n        *   Could they be a form of data augmentation that forces the model to learn features that are inherently robust to the precision constraints imposed by ST?\\n\\n**Overall Theoretical Soundness:** Currently, the most significant theoretical gap is the definition and mechanism of \"collaborative examples.\" The understanding of the loss landscape and the regularization effect of Squeeze Training are relatively well-understood concepts that *could* be integrated into a cohesive theory. The soundness depends entirely on how the novel \"collaborative examples\" concept is formalized and how it theoretically interacts with the loss landscape and ST. Without this, it\\'s a piecewise, not a unified, theory.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Potential Impact on the Understanding of Deep Neural Networks\\n\\n*   **Novel Regularization Pathways:** If the \"collaborative examples\" concept can be formalized and shown to work synergistically with ST, it could open up a new class of regularization techniques. Instead of just penalizing weight magnitudes (L1/L2) or injecting dropout noise, we might explicitly design data (collaborative examples) and training methods (ST) to sculpt the loss landscape in a desired way.\\n*   **Bridging Efficiency and Theory:** ST, especially in the context of quantization, is primarily an efficiency technique. Demonstrating its deep connection to loss landscape regularization provides a stronger theoretical underpinning for *why* quantized models can generalize well, moving beyond just empirical observation. This could drive the development of \"theoretically justified efficient models.\"\\n*   **Deeper Insights into Generalization and Robustness:** Understanding how specific data patterns (\"collaborative examples\") interact with parameter constraints (ST) to shape the loss landscape provides a more granular view of generalization. It moves beyond just \"more data\" or \"larger models\" to a focus on the *quality* of data interactions and the *type* of parameter space the model occupies.\\n*   **Beyond Adversarial Examples:** If \"collaborative examples\" define a new class of data interaction, it could expand our understanding of model vulnerabilities and strengths beyond the current focus on single-input adversarial perturbations.\\n*   **Framework for Future Research:** The approach could inspire research into:\\n    *   Algorithms for generating \"collaborative examples.\"\\n    *   New ST variants specifically designed to exploit landscape properties.\\n    *   Theoretical bounds that incorporate data-level interaction and parameter precision.\\n\\n**Potential Challenges/Limitations to Impact:**\\n\\n*   **Scalability:** Generating/identifying \"collaborative examples\" might be computationally intensive for large datasets.\\n*   **Generalizability:** Will the principles apply universally across different architectures and tasks?\\n*   **Interpretability:** The interaction between data properties and landscape geometry can be complex to interpret.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe proposed analysis brings together two established concepts (loss landscape analysis and Squeeze Training as regularization) with a novel, but currently undefined, concept (\"collaborative examples\").\\n\\n*   **Loss Landscape Analysis:** Essential for understanding model behavior, and its evaluation relies on rigorous metrics (Hessian, eigenvalues) and empirical correlation with performance.\\n*   **Collaborative Examples:** This is the *critical missing piece*. Its theoretical soundness and potential impact are entirely contingent on a precise, formal definition of what constitutes such an example and how it mechanistically influences the model or the landscape. Without this, it\\'s a speculative concept.\\n*   **Squeeze Training Justification:** The argument for ST (assuming quantization/compression) as a regularizer is conceptually strong, leveraging ideas of noise injection, implicit capacity control, and forced robustness, leading to flatter minima.\\n\\n**Overall, the theoretical soundness of the *entire approach* is currently limited by the ambiguity of \"collaborative examples.\"** If this concept can be concretely defined and rigorously linked to the loss landscape and ST, the approach has the **potential for significant impact** by:\\n1.  Offering novel regularization strategies that integrate data properties with training methods.\\n2.  Providing deeper theoretical insights into *why* efficient models generalize well.\\n3.  Expanding our understanding of data\\'s role in shaping the complex landscape of deep neural networks, moving beyond the well-trodden path of adversarial examples to potentially more nuanced \"cooperative\" data interactions.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.8613016}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Squeeze Training (ST) refers to a class of knowledge distillation techniques where a **smaller, typically pre-trained or quickly trained, teacher model** guides the training of a **larger student model**. The core idea is that the smaller teacher, despite its limited capacity, can capture robust and generalizable features, which it then \"squeezes\" into the more complex student, helping it converge faster, more stably, and often achieve higher accuracy than training the student from scratch.\\n\\nLet\\'s evaluate its practical aspects, implementation, complexity, generalization, and offer suggestions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of Squeeze Training (ST)\\n\\n#### 1. Practical Aspects\\n\\n*   **Advantages:**\\n    *   **Improved Convergence:** The student model often converges faster and more stably, especially for very deep or complex architectures prone to vanishing/exploding gradients or local minima. The teacher\\'s \"soft targets\" provide a richer training signal than hard labels alone.\\n    *   **Higher Accuracy:** Can lead to better final performance for the student model by acting as a strong regularization technique, guiding the student to learn more generalizable features.\\n    *   **Reduced Training Time (Overall):** While it adds an initial teacher training phase, the student might require fewer epochs or less hyperparameter tuning to reach desired performance, potentially saving total wall-clock time.\\n    *   **Robustness:** The smaller teacher might implicitly learn simpler, more robust features, transferring this robustness to the student.\\n    *   **Leveraging Existing Models:** If a good small model already exists for a task (e.g., a MobileNet for object detection), it can be effectively used as a teacher for a larger model (e.g., a ResNet or EfficientNet).\\n\\n*   **Disadvantages:**\\n    *   **Increased Complexity:** Requires managing two models (teacher and student), defining a distillation loss, and tuning additional hyperparameters (temperature, distillation loss weight).\\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimal values for distillation temperature ($T$), the weighting factor ($\\\\alpha$) between distillation loss and cross-entropy loss, and the teacher training schedule can be challenging to find.\\n    *   **Teacher Performance Critical:** The quality of the teacher model significantly impacts the student\\'s performance. A poorly trained or unsuitable teacher can hurt the student.\\n    *   **Memory Footprint:** During student training, both the teacher and student models need to be in memory simultaneously for forward passes, increasing GPU memory requirements.\\n\\n#### 2. Implementation Details\\n\\nImplementing Squeeze Training typically involves:\\n\\n1.  **Teacher Model Selection & Training:**\\n    *   **Choose a Teacher Architecture:** Select a model that is significantly smaller than the student but known to perform reasonably well on the task (e.g., ResNet-18 as teacher for ResNet-50).\\n    *   **Train the Teacher:** Train the teacher model on the target dataset until it achieves good performance. This can be done independently. For best results, use standard training practices (optimizer, learning rate schedule, data augmentation).\\n\\n2.  **Student Model Initialization:**\\n    *   **Choose a Student Architecture:** The larger model you want to train.\\n    *   **Initialization:** The student can be initialized from scratch or using pre-trained weights (e.g., ImageNet pre-training) for its own architecture.\\n\\n3.  **Distillation Loss Integration:**\\n    *   **Combined Loss Function:** The total loss for the student is usually a weighted sum of the standard cross-entropy loss (comparing student predictions to true labels) and the distillation loss (comparing student logits to teacher logits).\\n        $L_{total} = (1 - \\\\alpha) \\\\cdot L_{CE}(y_{student}, y_{true}) + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot L_{KD}(y_{student}, y_{teacher})$\\n    *   **Knowledge Distillation (KD) Loss:** The most common form is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between the softened student and teacher probability distributions.\\n        *   **Softmax with Temperature:** Probabilities are computed as $P_i = \\\\exp(z_i/T) / \\\\sum_j \\\\exp(z_j/T)$, where $z_i$ are logits and $T$ is the temperature. A higher $T$ produces softer (more uniform) distributions, revealing more relational information between classes.\\n        *   **KL Divergence:** $L_{KD} = \\\\sum_i P_{teacher}(i) \\\\log \\\\frac{P_{teacher}(i)}{P_{student}(i)}$. Often, $L_{KD}$ is scaled by $T^2$ to maintain the relative magnitude of gradients, as proposed in Hinton et al. (2015).\\n    *   **Teacher Mode:** During student training, the teacher model is typically set to `eval()` mode and its gradients are frozen (`torch.no_grad()`). Only the student\\'s weights are updated.\\n\\n4.  **Training Loop:**\\n    *   For each batch:\\n        *   Perform forward pass with the teacher model to get teacher logits. (No gradient computation here)\\n        *   Perform forward pass with the student model to get student logits.\\n        *   Calculate $L_{CE}$ using student logits and true labels.\\n        *   Calculate $L_{KD}$ using softened student and teacher logits.\\n        *   Calculate $L_{total}$.\\n        *   Backpropagate $L_{total}$ through the student model and update its weights.\\n\\n#### 3. Computational Complexity\\n\\n*   **Teacher Training:** This is an *additional* up-front cost. Its magnitude depends on the teacher\\'s size and the dataset. For many applications, this is relatively quick due to the teacher being small.\\n*   **Student Training (with distillation):**\\n    *   **Forward Pass:** Requires running *two* forward passes (one for teacher, one for student) per mini-batch. Since the teacher is smaller, its forward pass is significantly faster than the student\\'s, but it\\'s still an overhead.\\n    *   **Backward Pass:** Only the student model\\'s parameters are updated, so the backward pass complexity is roughly the same as training the student alone (plus the gradient computation for the combined loss function, which is negligible).\\n    *   **Memory Usage:** This is the most significant increase. Both the teacher and student models, along with their intermediate activations, must reside in GPU memory simultaneously during the student\\'s training phase. This can significantly limit the maximum batch size that can be used.\\n*   **Overall:** ST adds computational cost compared to training the student alone. However, this cost can be justified if it leads to faster convergence (fewer epochs), better final performance, or more stable training, ultimately saving *total research time* or achieving a better model.\\n\\n#### 4. Potential for Generalization to Different Datasets and Network Architectures\\n\\n*   **Datasets:**\\n    *   **High Potential:** Squeeze Training, like general knowledge distillation, is highly generalizable across various datasets. It has been successfully applied to image classification (ImageNet, CIFAR, etc.), object detection, segmentation, and natural language processing tasks.\\n    *   **Benefits for Complex Datasets:** It can be particularly beneficial for large, complex datasets where training very deep models from scratch is challenging (e.g., ImageNet-scale, medical imaging datasets with high resolution and complex patterns). The teacher can help guide the student through the intricate data landscape.\\n\\n*   **Network Architectures:**\\n    *   **High Potential:** The concept is highly flexible regarding architecture choices.\\n    *   **Teacher:** Can be any smaller, well-performing model. Examples include MobileNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet-B0/B1, smaller ResNets (ResNet-18, 34), or even compact custom architectures.\\n    *   **Student:** Can be any larger model, often a larger version of the same family (e.g., ResNet-50/101, EfficientNet-B5/B7) or a completely different, more powerful architecture.\\n    *   **Compatibility:** The primary requirement is that the models produce comparable outputs (e.g., logits for classification, feature maps for feature-level distillation). For classification, only the final logit layer needs to be compatible in terms of number of classes. For other tasks, feature map sizes might need to align if using feature-level distillation.\\n    *   **Cross-Architecture Distillation:** ST excels here. A teacher from one family (e.g., MobileNet) can guide a student from another (e.g., Vision Transformer), as long as the output interface for distillation is consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Practical Suggestions for Improving the Training Process and Reducing Computational Cost\\n\\n#### A. Teacher-Centric Optimizations\\n\\n1.  **Choose the Smallest Effective Teacher:** Don\\'t pick a teacher that\\'s overly complex. The goal is a *competent* guide, not a perfect one. Simpler teachers train faster and have less inference overhead during student training.\\n2.  **Pre-train Teacher on Larger Datasets (if available):** If your target dataset is a subset or specific domain, pre-training the teacher on a larger, more general dataset (e.g., ImageNet for vision tasks) can significantly improve its quality and reduce the training time needed on your specific dataset.\\n3.  **Teacher Pruning/Quantization (for inference):** While the teacher isn\\'t deployed, its forward pass during student training still consumes resources. If the teacher is large, consider applying quantization or pruning to the *teacher model only* for its forward passes during student training, if your framework supports it seamlessly without affecting numerical stability. (This is less common but theoretically possible).\\n4.  **Teacher Epochs:** Monitor teacher performance. Stop training the teacher once its validation performance plateaus; overtraining the teacher offers diminishing returns and wastes time.\\n\\n#### B. Student Training (with Distillation) Optimizations\\n\\n1.  **Freeze Teacher Parameters and Set to Evaluation Mode:** Crucially, during student training, the teacher model should be set to `model.eval()` and its gradients explicitly disabled (`with torch.no_grad():` or `teacher_model.requires_grad_(False)`). This significantly speeds up its forward pass and prevents unnecessary memory allocation for gradients.\\n2.  **Gradual Distillation Warm-up:**\\n    *   **Initial Pure CE:** Start the student training with only the standard cross-entropy loss for a few epochs. This allows the student to learn basic features from hard labels without being immediately constrained by the teacher.\\n    *   **Gradual Introduction:** Slowly increase the $\\\\alpha$ (distillation loss weight) over a few epochs, from 0 to its target value. This prevents early confusion or gradient instability.\\n3.  **Dynamic Temperature Scheduling:** Experiment with a fixed temperature $T$ (common values are 2-10). Some research suggests annealing $T$ over time, starting high and decreasing, or vice-versa. This is highly problem-dependent.\\n4.  **Targeted Knowledge Transfer:**\\n    *   **Logit Distillation (Standard):** Most common and computationally efficient. Only requires the final layer\\'s output.\\n    *   **Feature Map Distillation:** Transfer knowledge from intermediate layers (e.g., matching feature maps after a specific block). This can provide a richer signal but increases computational complexity (more element-wise operations) and memory usage (more feature maps to store). Use sparingly and strategically.\\n    *   **Attention Map Distillation:** For transformer models, transferring attention patterns can be effective.\\n5.  **Memory Management:**\\n    *   **Reduce Batch Size:** If GPU memory is an issue due to two models, reduce the batch size. Use gradient accumulation to simulate larger effective batch sizes if needed.\\n    *   **Checkpoints:** If student is extremely large, use gradient checkpointing (activation checkpointing) to trade compute for memory.\\n\\n#### C. General Training Optimizations\\n\\n1.  **Efficient Hardware:** Use GPUs with sufficient VRAM. Modern training often benefits from high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\\n2.  **Profiling:** Use profiling tools (e.g., `nvprof`, PyTorch\\'s profiler) to identify bottlenecks in your training loop.\\n3.  **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Tools like Optuna, Ray Tune, or Weights & Biases Sweeps can automate the search for optimal $\\\\alpha$, $T$, learning rates, and warm-up schedules, significantly reducing manual tuning time.\\n4.  **Early Stopping:** Implement early stopping based on validation set performance to prevent overfitting and avoid unnecessary training epochs for the student. This saves significant computational cost in the long run.\\n5.  **Distributed Training (if student is very large):** Standard distributed data parallel (DDP) can still be used for the student model, but the teacher forward pass would still run on each GPU, adding overhead. Model parallelism might be needed for extremely large students.\\n\\nBy carefully considering these practical aspects and applying the suggested optimizations, Squeeze Training can be a highly effective strategy for training high-performance deep learning models more efficiently and robustly.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.8602351}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The agents have provided their reviews.
