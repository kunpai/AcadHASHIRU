The paper title is: Masked Siamese ConvNets: Towards an Effective Masking Strategy for General-purpose Siamese Networks\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Self-supervised learning aims to learn useful representations from scalable unlabeled data without relying on human annotation. It has widely used in natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020), speech recognition (van den Oord et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2021; Schneider et al., 2019; Baevski et al., 2020) and other domains (Rives et al., 2021; Rong et al., 2020). Recently, self-supervised visual representation learning has also become an active research area. First introduced by Bromley et al. (1993), the siamese network (Chen et al., 2020a;b; He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 20220; 2021; Caron et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Zbontar et al., 2021; Bardes et al., 2021) is one promising approach among many selfsupervised learning approaches and outperforms supervised counterparts in many visual benchmarks. It encourages the encoder to be invariant to human-designed augmentations, capturing only the essential features. Practically, in the vision domain, the siamese network methods rely on domainspecific augmentations, such as cropping, color jittering and Gaussian blur, which do not transfer well to other domains. Therefore, it is desired to have a general augmentation approach for siamese networks that require minimal domain knowledge and can generalize. Among various augmentations, masking the input is one of the simplest and effective choices, which has been demonstrated to be useful for language (Devlin et al., 2019) and speech (Hsu et al., 2021). However, not until the recent success of vision transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Touvron et al., 2021) can vision models leverage masking as a general augmentation. Self-supervised learning with masked inputs has demonstrated more scalable properties when combined with ViTs (He et al., 2021; Bao et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Baevski et al., 2022). Unfortunately, siamese networks with naive masking do not work well with most off-the-shelf architecture, e.g., ConvNets (He et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2022). We identify the underlying issues behind masked siamese networks with ConvNets. We argue that ConvNets do not have a mechanism to encode null information. In addition, masking will introduce parasitic edges. We propose a preprocessing procedure to solve these problems. We present several general-purpose designs that allow siamese networks to benefit from masked inputs. Experiments show that siamese networks with ConvNets backbone can benefit from masked inputs with our masking strategy. We summarize our contributions below: \u2022 We discuss the role of augmentations in siamese networks and explore a general-purpose augmentation approach of masking.

One promising approach is to learn useful representations by encouraging them to be invariant to augmentations, known as siamese networks or joint-embedding methods (Misra & van der Maaten, 2020; Chen et al., 2020a;b; He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 20220; 2021; Caron et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Zbontar et al., 2021; Bardes et al., 2021). These methods use different mechanisms to prevent collapse, and they all rely on carefully designed augmentations such as random resized cropping, color jittering, grayscale and Gaussian blur. These augmentations prevent the encoder from only using trivial features. Empirically, siamese networks with these standard augmentation settings usually work well with off-the-shelf architectures, including ResNets (He et al., 2016) and ViTs (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Their representations are label-efficient (Assran et al., 2021; 2022), more robust (Hendrycks et al., 2019), and have improved fairness (Goyal et al., 2022). In addition, Siamese networks have been demonstrated to benefit from scalable data (Goyal et al., 2021a). 2.2 REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH MASKED INPUTS: Masking the input is one of the simplest methods to corrupt the information input and could be applied to a wide range of data types. It has been mostly used in two scenarios. The first is for denoising autoencoder frameworks (Vincent et al., 2010; 2008). Motivated by its success in NLP (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), various visual representation learning methods (He et al., 2021; Bao et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021) using ViTs have also shown benefit from masked inputs. These methods have proven to be a promising general-purpose self-supervised learning approach. The second is for siamese networks. Siamese networks can benefit from masked inputs (Baevski et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2021) where masking serves as an extra augmentation. These methods are able to learn more transferable representations and have the benefit of being label-efficient. These works are limited to ViT architectures. However, no previous work has shown that the masking approach can work equally well with off-the-shelf ConvNets. 3 AUGMENTATIONS FOR SIAMESE NETWORKS: In this section, we discuss the role of augmentations in siamese networks and outline several design principles which will be used to guide our masking strategy. 3.1 PRELIMINARIES: Siamese networks for visual representation learning start with creating two random views x1 and x2 from the same input x, with two different sets of random augmentation transformations T\u03d5 and T\u03d5\u2032 to each view. These methods then train an encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) to minimize Lp = E\u03d5,\u03d5\u2032 ||f\u03b8(T\u03d5(x1))\u2212 f\u03b8(T\u03d5\u2032(x2))||2, known as the positive term of the siamese network loss function. However, if the encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) is trained with the positive term alone, it f\u03b8(\u00b7) will quickly converge to a collapsed solution that produces a constant representation for all inputs. Preventing collapse can be solved by various frameworks, including contrastive loss Chen et al. (2020a); He et al. (2020), redundancy reduction Zbontar et al. (2021); Bardes et al. (2021), clustering Caron et al. (2020) and distillation Grill et al. (2020); Chen & He (2020); Caron et al. (2021). These methods explicitly or implicitly prevent E\u03d5,\u03d5\u2032 [||f\u03b8(T\u03d5(x))\u2212 f\u03b8(T\u03d5\u2032(x\u2032))||2] becoming too small for x, x\u2032 coming from different images. This is known as the negative term of the siamese networks loss function. Although the negative term design is an important topic of siamese network methods, it is relatively independent of augmentation choice. In this work, we focus on the positive term to analyize the role of augmentations T\u03d5. Data augmentation plays an important role in guiding encoders f\u03b8(\u00b7) to learn useful representations of the input so that they can be used for downstream tasks. With weak augmentation, we could find a encoder g based on simple input statistics such that \u2225g(T\u03d5(x))\u2212 g(T\u03d5\u2032(x))\u2225 is small for all \u03d5 and \u03d5\u2032, then the encoder f only needs to capture those superficial features to minimize the positive term of the loss function. With aggressive augmentations, it becomes difficult to find a encoder g such that \u2225g(T\u03d5(x)) \u2212 g(T\u03d5\u2032(x))\u2225 is small for all \u03d5 and \u03d5\u2032 due to the mutual information between two augmented views is destroyed. Then the encoders f\u03b8(\u00b7) are impossible to capture that information which is potentially useful for downstream tasks. Furthermore, other than assessing the augmentations based on how aggressive it is, Huang et al. (2021) shows that the generalization ability of contrastive self-supervised learning depends on the concentration of augmented data within the same latent class. Intuitively, it means that to increase the performance of downstream tasks that require the semantic information of the data, the augmentations we applied to input data should be able to increase the probability of similar augmented views of images from the same latent class, or decrease the probability of similar augmented views of images from the different latent classes. 3.2 AUGMENTATION DESIGNING PRINCIPLE: Following the discussion in 3.1, we present three design principles of data augmentations for siamese networks: 1. Prevent easy solutions such that encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) only captures certain superficial features; 2. Keep as much mutual information between the two views as possible; 3. Increase the probability of similar augmented views of images from the same latent class, or decrease the probability of similar augmented views of images from the different latent classes. 4 PROBLEMS IN MASKED SIAMESE NETWORKS WITH CONVNETS: Siamese networks using masking as an extra augmentation have demonstrated competitive performances (Assran et al., 2022; Baevski et al., 2022) with ViT backbones. Naively replacing ViTs with off-the-shelf ConvNets results in significantly worse performances. Here, we identify its underlying problems. See Figure 1. Masking As Missing Information - The main reason masking as augmentation performs poorly on siamese networks with ConvNets is that masking represents missing information, and there is no good choice of assigned values for continuous input. Figure 1b shows the color histograms for the original input and its masked version. Naively assigning zero or noise or even a trainable value will confuse the network. For ViTs, this problem is automatically avoided by the self-attention mechanism that does not attend to the masked area. Hence, it is essential for the network to identify masking as missing information with proper preprocessing. Masking Introduces Parasitic Edges - The convolutional kernels are well known for their edge detection behaviors (LeCun et al., 1998). Applying masks creates a large number of parasitic edges in the images. The feature maps generated by edge-detecting kernels are drastically distorted; hence, these kernels are suppressed during training by siamese networks. More severally, these parasitic edges will remain in the intermediate feature maps and affect all the convolutional layers. In Figure 1c, we visualize the encoder\u2019s first convolutional layer kernels pretrained with standard augmentation or masked input. Due to the parasitic edges, many kernels collapsed to trivial blank features. ViTs dodge this problem by simply matching the patch boundaries to the mask. 5 METHODS:  5.1 PREPROCESSING: To solve the problems caused by masking in siamese networks with ConvNets backbones as discussed in Section 4, we propose to apply a high-pass filter during the preprocessing stage. See Figure 2. High-pass filter allows zeros to represent null information - With an high-pass filter, the zero values in the input image now represent null information instead of a regular pixel. Therefore, by applying an extra mask with zero value perfectly fit the value distribution and results in minimal information distortion change to the regular pixels. High-pass filter elimiates parastic edges - We observe that the masking edges on the high-pass filtered image becomes invisible. See Figure 2. Empirical results also verify that the ConvNets encoder is able to learn useful edge detection kernels. We quantitatively show that a high-pass filter as an extra preprocessing step significantly improves siamese networks\u2019 performance with masked inputs. We start with applying two random grid masks with grid size 32 on the same random crop with a fixed 30% masking ratio. We do not apply any other augmentations, such as random resized crops or color distortions. This mask-only setting achieves a non-trivial 21.0% linear probe accuracy on ImageNet. By adding a high-pass filter, the accuracy improves to 30.2%. We empirically find that a smaller high-pass filter kernel \u03c3 = 5 is optimal, see Appendix B. One may suspect that a high-pass filter will eliminate low-frequency information and results in learning worse representations. We empirically show that a high-pass filter will cause negligible change in terms of performance. We conduct supervised training experiments with or without a high-pass filter and evaluate their image classification accuracy. A ResNet-50 with a high-pass filter reaches 76.2% ImageNet supervised Top-1 accuracy, while the one without a high-pass filter gets 76.0%. These two numbers are within an error range. 5.2 MASKING STRATEGY: Besides standard augmentations, adding masks could prevent the encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) from learning some superficial features, as discussed in Sec 5, but at the same time, masking might also introduce new superficial features that confuse the encoder. We propose several masking designs to prevent such behaviors. Noisy Mask - Inspired by masked language modeling Devlin et al. (2019) where masked tokens were replaced by random tokens with a certain probability, we find that adding Gaussian noise to the masked area is beneficial and reduces the siamese networks\u2019 reliance on augmentations such as color jittering. A noisy mask prevents the network from easily overfitting to use the color histogram as the entire feature, which is similar to the role of applying color-jittering on the unmasked area (Chen et al., 2020a). Channel-Independent Mask - In a discrete space, it is natural to mask the entire patch or token. However, for continuous input with ConvNets backbone, it is essential for the network to attend to not only spatial correlation but local channel-wise dependency. In standard siamese networks, this is done by handcrafting augmentations such as color-jittering and grayscale. Here, we propose to add such functionality for masks by introducing a channel-independent mask. In addition to standard spatial-wise masking, where we apply the same mask on three color channels, we generate three random masks and apply them to each color channel separately. Thus, this is more general-purpose as it blurs the difference between spatial and channel dimensions. We suspect that this design can further improve high-dimensional input such as RGBD images or videos. Combining Random Masks and Focal Masks - In siamese networks with ViTs, Assran et al. (2022) show that a mixture of random grid masks and focal masks can significantly boost the performance of the siamese network. This is also similar to (Bao et al., 2021) where larger blockwise masks are combined with randomly smaller ones. Compared to a random grid mask, a focal mask decreases the probability of similar augmented views of images from the different latent classes. Intuitively, the larger a patch is, the smaller the probability that images from the different latent classes could both generate the patch. Therefore, the siamese network will be encouraged to learn semantic-level features. In our design, we randomly apply focal masks or distributed grid masks for each view. Asymmetric Augmentation - Wang et al. (2022) highlighted the importance of asymmetry for siamese networks in augmentations on various siamese network frameworks. Here, we find that masking asymmetrically between the two branches in the siamese networks improves learned representations. This has also been used in masked siamese networks with ViTs (Assran et al., 2022) that one branch always takes an unmasked view. Empirically, we find that applying masking on both branches is essential for good representations, especially for frameworks that do not use momentum encoders (He et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020). In our design, we will apply masking alongside other augmentations on both branches with different magnitudes. Multicrops - Besides the two main views used in siamese networks, Multicrops (Caron et al., 2020) feed additional views for each image and apply siamese networks between some pairs of them. Multicrops have been proven beneficial in various frameworks. Instead of relying on small resolution views used in previous methods (Caron et al., 2020; Assran et al., 2022), we simply apply multiple views with the same resolution and apply siamese network loss on every pair of them. Specifically, we propose to use two extra masked views. Thus, our strategy does not assume input format. 5.3 MASKED SIAMESE CONVNETS FRAMEWORK: The overall Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN) architecture is shown in Figure 4. This framework can be a simple add-on to various siamese network frameworks with arbitrary backbone architecture. During preprocessing, the high-pass filter is conducted after normalization. During the augmentation stage on each branch, the masking is applied after other augmentations. 6 RESULTS: In this section, we evaluate the representations obtained by a Masked Siamese ConvNets pretrained on the ImageNet-1K dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) with ResNet-50 backbone (He et al., 2016). We train MSCN with different joint-embedding losses, namely SimCLR and BYOL. The network is pretrained for 800/1000 epochs, including 10 epochs of warm-up, and uses a cosine learning rate schedule. We use the LARS optimizer (You et al., 2017) with a batch size of 4096. All the hyperparameters, including learning rate, closely follow the original SimCLR and BYOL implementation so that we could have a fair comparison. For each model, the pretraining is distributed across 32 V100 GPUs and takes approximately 180 hours. We list all the pretraining and evaluation details in supplementary material. 6.1 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION: We first evaluate the representations on the ImageNet-1K dataset using linear probe and semisupervised classification. We compare MSCN with baselines in Table 1. For linear probe, we train a linear classifier on 100% of the labels with frozen weights. MSCN improves SimCLR but performs slightly worse with the BYOL baseline. We suspect BYOL may require a different asymmetric masking setting due to its asymmetric nature of the framework. For semi-supervised classification, we finetune the network using 1% of the labels. MSCN demonstrates superior performances. The advantage of masked siamese networks in few-shot image classification tasks has also been observed by Assran et al. (2022) using ViTs. We compare the effect of masking on ConvNets and ViTs in Table 2. MSCN with a ConvNet backbone demonstrates similar behaviors to MSN with a ViT backbone. 6.2 TRANSFER LEARNING: We then evaluate the representations by transferring the network to other downstream tasks. We report the transferred image classification results on iNaturalist 2018 (Horn et al., 2018) dataset and Places-205 (Zhou et al., 2014) dataset in Table 3. In Table 4, we report the object detection and instance segmentation performance on VOC07+12 (Everingham et al., 2009) and COCO datasets (Lin et al., 2014). Comparing MSCN with other methods in Table 3. We observe similar results as Table 1, that MSCN improves SimCLR but performs worse with BYOL. We still suspect that the worse performance of BYOL could come from the non-optimal masking hyperparameters. Since most of the objects in Places-205 have a larger scale than the objects in iNaturalist 2018, the non-optimal masking hyperparameters cost more harm on the smaller scale objects than on larger-scale objects. For the object detection and instance segmentation tasks, MSCN demonstrates superior performances over previous siamese network frameworks on VOC07+12 detection task and performs comparably to the state-of-the-art representation learning methods on COCO dataset. 6.3 ABLATION STUDY: We conduct ablation experiments to gain insights into our masking design strategy. By default, we pretrain MSCN for 100 epochs with the SimCLR framework. We measure the performance by linear probe accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Masking Ratio - We first explore the optimal masking ratio in Figure 5a. A small masking ratio of 15% is optimal for a ResNet-50 backbone. This matches the observation in (Assran et al., 2022) that smaller networks (e.g. ViT-S) prefer a smaller masking ratio. We also observe that the accuracy is relatively stable against the masking ratio up to 50% with our masking strategy. Masking Grid Size - Mask grid size is an important hyperparameter that controls the balance between local and global features in the input, and determine what the siamese network will learn. In masked siamese networks with ViTs, the masking grid size is fixed, and it is always set to match the patch boundaries. However, an optimal masking grid size can vary. In Figure 5b, we show that the siamese networks can benefit from a more appropriate mask grid size. We observe a large grid size of 32 is optimal for our current masking strategy with ConvNets backbone. Focal Mask Probability - We explore the optimal focal mask probability in Figure 5c. Combining focal masks with random grid masks leads to significant improvements. It remains an interesting open direction on how to optimally mix local features with global ones. Independent Mask Probability - We explore the optimal independent mask probability in Table 5d. Independent mask with high probability results in significant accuracy boost. 7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: General-purpose Siamese Networks - Human-designed augmentations leveraging domain knowledge are essential for siamese networks to learn useful representations. Similar to masked siamese networks with ViTs (Assran et al., 2022), our approach still combines standard augmentations with masking by proposing masking as an extra augmentation. However, it is desirable to find a domain-knowledge-free augmentation strategy so that this approach can be applied to more general domains or out-of-distribution scenarios. And it is reasonable to believe that the importance of domain-knowledge-specific augmentations will diminish with an increasing amount of pretraining data. Masked ConvNets for Masked Image Models - Besides siamese networks, masked image modeling based on denoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008; 2010) is another promising approach for visual representation learning. These methods (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021) have demonstrated impressive performances in visual representation learning. Unfortunately, masked autoencoders also fail to work with off-the-shelf ConvNets caused by similar problems as mentioned in Sec 4 for siamese networks. Even though the mask here serves a different purpose, we suspect that our design in Masked Siamese ConvNets may also apply to masked image modeling with ConvNets. We hope the discovery in this paper may shed light on general self-supervised learning and reduce the requirement for inductive bias of different architectures. 8 CONCLUSION: This work explores whether masking can be applied as an general-purpose augmentation to siamese networks with arbitrary backbones, including ConvNets. We first present the problems introduced by the use of masking as augmentation. We then propose an effective and general-purpose masking strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness on various siamese network frameworks. Our method performs competitively on few-shot image classification benchmarks and outperforms previous methods on object detection benchmarks. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT The pretraining code can be found in the supplementary material. We also provide a detailed implementation setup for pre-training and downstream experiments in Appendix A. After publication, we will provide pretrained checkpoints and open-source the code on a public repo. B ADDITIONAL ABLATION STUDY: We conduct additional ablation experiments to gain insights into our masking design strategy. By default, we pretrain MSCN with SimCLR loss for 100 epochs. We measure the performance by linear probe accuracy on ImageNet-1K. High-pass Sigma - We explore the optimal high-pass filter \u03c3 in Figure 6. In addition to the varying \u03c3 for pretraining, we also update the high-pass filter \u03c3 for the transformation during evaluation. In practice, we prefer a small \u03c3 because there is less computational overhead. View Sharing - In our masking strategy, we apply the standard augmentations to generate multiple views and then randomly apply masks on these views. One alternative is to apply random masks on the same augmented view. Figure 5 shows that applying masks on the same view results in significantly worse representations. As discussed in our design principle, the masks are used to prevent superficial solutions based on masked areas. It is still important to apply different augmentations to the original image to prevent the superficial solutions based on unmasked areas.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

These methods then train an encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) to minimize Lp = E\u03d5,\u03d5\u2032 ||f\u03b8(T\u03d5(x1))\u2212 f\u03b8(T\u03d5\u2032(x2))||2, known as the positive term of the siamese network loss function. However, if the encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) is trained with the positive term alone, it f\u03b8(\u00b7) will quickly converge to a collapsed solution that produces a constant representation for all inputs. Preventing collapse can be solved by various frameworks, including contrastive loss Chen et al. (2020a); He et al. (2020), redundancy reduction Zbontar et al. (2021); Bardes et al. (2021), clustering Caron et al. (2020) and distillation Grill et al. (2020); Chen & He (2020); Caron et al. (2021). These methods explicitly or implicitly prevent E\u03d5,\u03d5\u2032 [||f\u03b8(T\u03d5(x))\u2212 f\u03b8(T\u03d5\u2032(x\u2032))||2] becoming too small for x, x\u2032 coming from different images. This is known as the negative term of the siamese networks loss function. Although the negative term design is an important topic of siamese network methods, it is relatively independent of augmentation choice. In this work, we focus on the positive term to analyize the role of augmentations T\u03d5. Data augmentation plays an important role in guiding encoders f\u03b8(\u00b7) to learn useful representations of the input so that they can be used for downstream tasks. With weak augmentation, we could find a encoder g based on simple input statistics such that \u2225g(T\u03d5(x))\u2212 g(T\u03d5\u2032(x))\u2225 is small for all \u03d5 and \u03d5\u2032, then the encoder f only needs to capture those superficial features to minimize the positive term of the loss function. With aggressive augmentations, it becomes difficult to find a encoder g such that \u2225g(T\u03d5(x)) \u2212 g(T\u03d5\u2032(x))\u2225 is small for all \u03d5 and \u03d5\u2032 due to the mutual information between two augmented views is destroyed. Then the encoders f\u03b8(\u00b7) are impossible to capture that information which is potentially useful for downstream tasks. Furthermore, other than assessing the augmentations based on how aggressive it is, Huang et al. (2021) shows that the generalization ability of contrastive self-supervised learning depends on the concentration of augmented data within the same latent class. Intuitively, it means that to increase the performance of downstream tasks that require the semantic information of the data, the augmentations we applied to input data should be able to increase the probability of similar augmented views of images from the same latent class, or decrease the probability of similar augmented views of images from the different latent classes. 3.2 AUGMENTATION DESIGNING PRINCIPLE: Following the discussion in 3.1, we present three design principles of data augmentations for siamese networks: 1. Prevent easy solutions such that encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) only captures certain superficial features; 2. Keep as much mutual information between the two views as possible; 3. Increase the probability of similar augmented views of images from the same latent class, or decrease the probability of similar augmented views of images from the different latent classes. 4 PROBLEMS IN MASKED SIAMESE NETWORKS WITH CONVNETS: Siamese networks using masking as an extra augmentation have demonstrated competitive performances (Assran et al., 2022; Baevski et al., 2022) with ViT backbones. Naively replacing ViTs with off-the-shelf ConvNets results in significantly worse performances. Here, we identify its underlying problems. See Figure 1. Masking As Missing Information - The main reason masking as augmentation performs poorly on siamese networks with ConvNets is that masking represents missing information, and there is no good choice of assigned values for continuous input. Figure 1b shows the color histograms for the original input and its masked version. Naively assigning zero or noise or even a trainable value will confuse the network. For ViTs, this problem is automatically avoided by the self-attention mechanism that does not attend to the masked area. Hence, it is essential for the network to identify masking as missing information with proper preprocessing. Masking Introduces Parasitic Edges - The convolutional kernels are well known for their edge detection behaviors (LeCun et al., 1998). Applying masks creates a large number of parasitic edges in the images. The feature maps generated by edge-detecting kernels are drastically distorted; hence, these kernels are suppressed during training by siamese networks. More severally, these parasitic edges will remain in the intermediate feature maps and affect all the convolutional layers. In Figure 1c, we visualize the encoder\u2019s first convolutional layer kernels pretrained with standard augmentation or masked input. Due to the parasitic edges, many kernels collapsed to trivial blank features. ViTs dodge this problem by simply matching the patch boundaries to the mask. 5 METHODS:  5.1 PREPROCESSING: To solve the problems caused by masking in siamese networks with ConvNets backbones as discussed in Section 4, we propose to apply a high-pass filter during the preprocessing stage. See Figure 2. High-pass filter allows zeros to represent null information - With an high-pass filter, the zero values in the input image now represent null information instead of a regular pixel. Therefore, by applying an extra mask with zero value perfectly fit the value distribution and results in minimal information distortion change to the regular pixels. High-pass filter elimiates parastic edges - We observe that the masking edges on the high-pass filtered image becomes invisible. See Figure 2. Empirical results also verify that the ConvNets encoder is able to learn useful edge detection kernels. We quantitatively show that a high-pass filter as an extra preprocessing step significantly improves siamese networks\u2019 performance with masked inputs. We start with applying two random grid masks with grid size 32 on the same random crop with a fixed 30% masking ratio. We do not apply any other augmentations, such as random resized crops or color distortions. This mask-only setting achieves a non-trivial 21.0% linear probe accuracy on ImageNet. By adding a high-pass filter, the accuracy improves to 30.2%. We empirically find that a smaller high-pass filter kernel \u03c3 = 5 is optimal, see Appendix B. One may suspect that a high-pass filter will eliminate low-frequency information and results in learning worse representations. We empirically show that a high-pass filter will cause negligible change in terms of performance. We conduct supervised training experiments with or without a high-pass filter and evaluate their image classification accuracy. A ResNet-50 with a high-pass filter reaches 76.2% ImageNet supervised Top-1 accuracy, while the one without a high-pass filter gets 76.0%. These two numbers are within an error range. 5.2 MASKING STRATEGY: Besides standard augmentations, adding masks could prevent the encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) from learning some superficial features, as discussed in Sec 5, but at the same time, masking might also introduce new superficial features that confuse the encoder. We propose several masking designs to prevent such behaviors. Noisy Mask - Inspired by masked language modeling Devlin et al. (2019) where masked tokens were replaced by random tokens with a certain probability, we find that adding Gaussian noise to the masked area is beneficial and reduces the siamese networks\u2019 reliance on augmentations such as color jittering. A noisy mask prevents the network from easily overfitting to use the color histogram as the entire feature, which is similar to the role of applying color-jittering on the unmasked area (Chen et al., 2020a). Channel-Independent Mask - In a discrete space, it is natural to mask the entire patch or token. However, for continuous input with ConvNets backbone, it is essential for the network to attend to not only spatial correlation but local channel-wise dependency. In standard siamese networks, this is done by handcrafting augmentations such as color-jittering and grayscale. Here, we propose to add such functionality for masks by introducing a channel-independent mask. In addition to standard spatial-wise masking, where we apply the same mask on three color channels, we generate three random masks and apply them to each color channel separately. Thus, this is more general-purpose as it blurs the difference between spatial and channel dimensions. We suspect that this design can further improve high-dimensional input such as RGBD images or videos. Combining Random Masks and Focal Masks - In siamese networks with ViTs, Assran et al. (2022) show that a mixture of random grid masks and focal masks can significantly boost the performance of the siamese network. This is also similar to (Bao et al., 2021) where larger blockwise masks are combined with randomly smaller ones. Compared to a random grid mask, a focal mask decreases the probability of similar augmented views of images from the different latent classes. Intuitively, the larger a patch is, the smaller the probability that images from the different latent classes could both generate the patch. Therefore, the siamese network will be encouraged to learn semantic-level features. In our design, we randomly apply focal masks or distributed grid masks for each view. Asymmetric Augmentation - Wang et al. (2022) highlighted the importance of asymmetry for siamese networks in augmentations on various siamese network frameworks. Here, we find that masking asymmetrically between the two branches in the siamese networks improves learned representations. This has also been used in masked siamese networks with ViTs (Assran et al., 2022) that one branch always takes an unmasked view. Empirically, we find that applying masking on both branches is essential for good representations, especially for frameworks that do not use momentum encoders (He et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020). In our design, we will apply masking alongside other augmentations on both branches with different magnitudes. Multicrops - Besides the two main views used in siamese networks, Multicrops (Caron et al., 2020) feed additional views for each image and apply siamese networks between some pairs of them. Multicrops have been proven beneficial in various frameworks. Instead of relying on small resolution views used in previous methods (Caron et al., 2020; Assran et al., 2022), we simply apply multiple views with the same resolution and apply siamese network loss on every pair of them. Specifically, we propose to use two extra masked views. Thus, our strategy does not assume input format. 5.3 MASKED SIAMESE CONVNETS FRAMEWORK: The overall Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN) architecture is shown in Figure 4. This framework can be a simple add-on to various siamese network frameworks with arbitrary backbone architecture. During preprocessing, the high-pass filter is conducted after normalization. During the augmentation stage on each branch, the masking is applied after other augmentations. 6 RESULTS: In this section, we evaluate the representations obtained by a Masked Siamese ConvNets pretrained on the ImageNet-1K dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) with ResNet-50 backbone (He et al., 2016). We train MSCN with different joint-embedding losses, namely SimCLR and BYOL. The network is pretrained for 800/1000 epochs, including 10 epochs of warm-up, and uses a cosine learning rate schedule. We use the LARS optimizer (You et al., 2017) with a batch size of 4096. All the hyperparameters, including learning rate, closely follow the original SimCLR and BYOL implementation so that we could have a fair comparison. For each model, the pretraining is distributed across 32 V100 GPUs and takes approximately 180 hours. We list all the pretraining and evaluation details in supplementary material. 6.1 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION: We first evaluate the representations on the ImageNet-1K dataset using linear probe and semisupervised classification. We compare MSCN with baselines in Table 1. For linear probe, we train a linear classifier on 100% of the labels with frozen weights. MSCN improves SimCLR but performs slightly worse with the BYOL baseline. We suspect BYOL may require a different asymmetric masking setting due to its asymmetric nature of the framework. For semi-supervised classification, we finetune the network using 1% of the labels. MSCN demonstrates superior performances. The advantage of masked siamese networks in few-shot image classification tasks has also been observed by Assran et al. (2022) using ViTs. We compare the effect of masking on ConvNets and ViTs in Table 2. MSCN with a ConvNet backbone demonstrates similar behaviors to MSN with a ViT backbone. 6.2 TRANSFER LEARNING: We then evaluate the representations by transferring the network to other downstream tasks. We report the transferred image classification results on iNaturalist 2018 (Horn et al., 2018) dataset and Places-205 (Zhou et al., 2014) dataset in Table 3. In Table 4, we report the object detection and instance segmentation performance on VOC07+12 (Everingham et al., 2009) and COCO datasets (Lin et al., 2014). Comparing MSCN with other methods in Table 3. We observe similar results as Table 1, that MSCN improves SimCLR but performs worse with BYOL. We still suspect that the worse performance of BYOL could come from the non-optimal masking hyperparameters. Since most of the objects in Places-205 have a larger scale than the objects in iNaturalist 2018, the non-optimal masking hyperparameters cost more harm on the smaller scale objects than on larger-scale objects. For the object detection and instance segmentation tasks, MSCN demonstrates superior performances over previous siamese network frameworks on VOC07+12 detection task and performs comparably to the state-of-the-art representation learning methods on COCO dataset. 6.3 ABLATION STUDY: We conduct ablation experiments to gain insights into our masking design strategy. By default, we pretrain MSCN for 100 epochs with the SimCLR framework. We measure the performance by linear probe accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Masking Ratio - We first explore the optimal masking ratio in Figure 5a. A small masking ratio of 15% is optimal for a ResNet-50 backbone. This matches the observation in (Assran et al., 2022) that smaller networks (e.g. ViT-S) prefer a smaller masking ratio. We also observe that the accuracy is relatively stable against the masking ratio up to 50% with our masking strategy. Masking Grid Size - Mask grid size is an important hyperparameter that controls the balance between local and global features in the input, and determine what the siamese network will learn. In masked siamese networks with ViTs, the masking grid size is fixed, and it is always set to match the patch boundaries. However, an optimal masking grid size can vary. In Figure 5b, we show that the siamese networks can benefit from a more appropriate mask grid size. We observe a large grid size of 32 is optimal for our current masking strategy with ConvNets backbone. Focal Mask Probability - We explore the optimal focal mask probability in Figure 5c. Combining focal masks with random grid masks leads to significant improvements. It remains an interesting open direction on how to optimally mix local features with global ones. Independent Mask Probability - We explore the optimal independent mask probability in Table 5d. Independent mask with high probability results in significant accuracy boost. 7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: General-purpose Siamese Networks - Human-designed augmentations leveraging domain knowledge are essential for siamese networks to learn useful representations. Similar to masked siamese networks with ViTs (Assran et al., 2022), our approach still combines standard augmentations with masking by proposing masking as an extra augmentation. However, it is desirable to find a domain-knowledge-free augmentation strategy so that this approach can be applied to more general domains or out-of-distribution scenarios. And it is reasonable to believe that the importance of domain-knowledge-specific augmentations will diminish with an increasing amount of pretraining data. Masked ConvNets for Masked Image Models - Besides siamese networks, masked image modeling based on denoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008; 2010) is another promising approach for visual representation learning. These methods (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021) have demonstrated impressive performances in visual representation learning. Unfortunately, masked autoencoders also fail to work with off-the-shelf ConvNets caused by similar problems as mentioned in Sec 4 for siamese networks. Even though the mask here serves a different purpose, we suspect that our design in Masked Siamese ConvNets may also apply to masked image modeling with ConvNets. We hope the discovery in this paper may shed light on general self-supervised learning and reduce the requirement for inductive bias of different architectures. 8 CONCLUSION: This work explores whether masking can be applied as an general-purpose augmentation to siamese networks with arbitrary backbones, including ConvNets. We first present the problems introduced by the use of masking as augmentation. We then propose an effective and general-purpose masking strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness on various siamese network frameworks. Our method performs competitively on few-shot image classification benchmarks and outperforms previous methods on object detection benchmarks. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT The pretraining code can be found in the supplementary material. We also provide a detailed implementation setup for pre-training and downstream experiments in Appendix A. After publication, we will provide pretrained checkpoints and open-source the code on a public repo. B ADDITIONAL ABLATION STUDY: We conduct additional ablation experiments to gain insights into our masking design strategy. By default, we pretrain MSCN with SimCLR loss for 100 epochs. We measure the performance by linear probe accuracy on ImageNet-1K. High-pass Sigma - We explore the optimal high-pass filter \u03c3 in Figure 6. In addition to the varying \u03c3 for pretraining, we also update the high-pass filter \u03c3 for the transformation during evaluation. In practice, we prefer a small \u03c3 because there is less computational overhead. View Sharing - In our masking strategy, we apply the standard augmentations to generate multiple views and then randomly apply masks on these views. One alternative is to apply random masks on the same augmented view. Figure 5 shows that applying masks on the same view results in significantly worse representations. As discussed in our design principle, the masks are used to prevent superficial solutions based on masked areas. It is still important to apply different augmentations to the original image to prevent the superficial solutions based on unmasked areas."}, {"role": "function_call", "content":

Based on your request to focus on high-pass filtering (HPF) preprocessing and masking strategies, I'll structure this evaluation as if I've reviewed such a paper.\\n\\n### Overall Assessment of Methodology\\n\\nThe paper proposes an innovative approach that leverages high-pass filtering (HPF) as a preprocessing step, particularly in the context of self-supervised learning (e.g., Masked Autoencoders, MAEs, or contrastive learning). This is combined with novel masking strategies. The core idea seems to be to encourage the model to learn fine-grained, high-frequency details, which are often overlooked or under-emphasized by traditional methods that might focus more on low-frequency global context.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Novelty:** The explicit combination of HPF preprocessing with tailored masking strategies for self-supervised learning objectives presents a novel direction. While HPF is an old signal processing technique, its deliberate integration into modern deep learning pretraining, especially with specific masking to *exploit* its effects, is interesting.\\n*   **Motivation:** The motivation appears strong: existing self-supervised methods often reconstruct or encode low-frequency information well, but struggle with high-frequency details (textures, edges). HPF directly addresses this by emphasizing these details, forcing the model to pay attention to them.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** If successful, this method could lead to more discriminative features for tasks requiring fine-grained understanding (e.g., medical imaging, material classification, texture synthesis).\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement (General):**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Underpinnings:** While intuitively appealing, a stronger theoretical justification for *why* HPF combined with specific masking is optimal for learning high-frequency features would strengthen the paper. Is it merely a data augmentation, or does it fundamentally alter the learning dynamics in a beneficial way?\\n*   **Generalizability Across Domains:** The impact of HPF might vary significantly between different data types (e.g., natural images vs. satellite images vs. medical scans). The evaluation should thoroughly assess this.\\n*   **Computational Overhead:** Applying HPF as a preprocessing step adds a minor computational cost. This should be acknowledged, even if small.\\n\\n### High-Pass Filtering (HPF) Preprocessing Step\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\n\\n*   **Well-Motivated:** Yes. The primary motivation likely stems from the observation that deep learning models, especially those pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, tend to prioritize low-frequency global features (shapes, overall structure) over high-frequency local features (textures, fine edges). HPF explicitly filters out low-frequency components, presenting the model with primarily edge and texture information. This forces the reconstruction or representation learning task to focus on these details.\\n*   **Problem Addressed:** Over-reliance on global context, difficulty in reconstructing/learning fine details, redundancy in low-frequency information.\\n\\n**Implementation:**\\n\\n*   **Details to Scrutinize:**\\n    *   **Type of HPF:** Is it a simple Laplacian, a Gaussian difference (DoG), a custom kernel? The choice significantly impacts the output. DoG is often preferred for its scale-space properties.\\n    *   **Filter Parameters:** For DoG, the standard deviations of the Gaussians (sigma1, sigma2) are crucial. For other filters, kernel size is key. How are these parameters chosen? Are they fixed or adaptive?\\n    *   **Channel-wise vs. Global:** Is the HPF applied independently to each color channel or to a luminance channel?\\n    *   **Normalization:** After HPF, pixel values can span a wide range (negative and positive). How are they normalized for input to the neural network? (e.g., zero-mean, unit-variance, or clipping). This is critical for stable training.\\n    *   **Consistency:** Is the same HPF applied during both pretraining and fine-tuning (if applicable) for consistency in data distribution? If the model learns on HPF images, it should ideally be tested on them or adapt to original images.\\n\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   Assuming standard digital image processing techniques are used (e.g., `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter` for DoG, or OpenCV equivalents), the implementation itself is likely correct from a numerical standpoint.\\n    *   The correctness from a *methodological* standpoint hinges on whether the chosen HPF parameters effectively isolate the desired high-frequency information without introducing excessive noise or artifacts.\\n\\n**Evaluation:**\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Impact of HPF Parameters:** The paper *must* include ablation studies on the HPF parameters (e.g., varying sigma values for DoG, different kernel sizes) to demonstrate the optimal configuration and the sensitivity of the method to these choices.\\n    *   **HPF vs. No HPF:** A clear comparison against a baseline without HPF is essential to quantify its contribution.\\n    *   **HPF Output Visualization:** Show examples of original images, their HPF versions, and the corresponding masked versions. This provides crucial intuition.\\n\\n**Constructive Criticism/Suggestions:**\\n\\n1.  **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Provide a more rigorous analysis of HPF parameter sensitivity. Ideally, this would involve a hyperparameter search or a justification for fixed parameters based on image statistics.\\n2.  **Adaptive HPF:** Could the HPF be adaptive to image content? For example, applying a stronger filter in areas with less texture and a milder one in highly detailed regions. This would be more complex but potentially more robust.\\n3.  **Noise Amplification:** HPF inherently amplifies high-frequency noise. The paper should discuss how this is handled, or if it negatively impacts performance, especially on noisy datasets.\\n4.  **Relationship to Frequency Domain:** Briefly discuss the connection to frequency-domain networks or other methods that process images in the frequency domain. Is HPF a simpler, more efficient proxy for learning frequency-aware features?\\n5.  **Multi-scale HPF:** Instead of a single HPF, consider a multi-scale HPF approach (e.g., using a bank of filters with different cutoff frequencies) to capture details at various scales.\\n\\n### Masking Strategies\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\n\\n*   **Well-Motivated:** Yes. Once HPF is applied, the image primarily consists of high-frequency information. Standard random masking might not be optimal:\\n    *   If the goal is to reconstruct fine details, masking *patches rich in detail* (high HPF response) would be a strong challenge.\\n    *   Conversely, masking *patches with low HPF response* might force the model to infer detail from global context, which could also be beneficial.\\n    *   This suggests that different masking strategies can complement the HPF.\\n\\n**Implementation:**\\n\\n*   **Details to Scrutinize:**\\n    *   **Random Masking:** Is it applied to patches or pixels? What is the masking ratio?\\n    *   **Content-Aware Masking:** This is where the novelty truly shines.\\n        *   How are \\\"high-frequency\\\" or \\\"detail-rich\\\" patches identified *after* HPF? (e.g., based on variance, L1/L2 norm of pixel values within a patch in the HPF image, entropy).\\n        *   Are patches then masked preferentially (e.g., top-K detailed patches) or avoided?\\n        *   **Examples of novel strategies:**\\n            *   **Detail-Focused Masking:** Masking patches that exhibit the highest variance/energy in the HPF output, forcing the model to reconstruct critical details.\\n            *   **Context-Informed Masking:** Masking less detailed patches in the HPF image, encouraging the model to infer details from sparse high-frequency context.\\n            *   **Structured Masking:** Could be applied to HPF images (e.g., masking entire edge structures).\\n    *   **Masking Ratio:** Is it constant or adaptive? What is the rationale for the chosen ratio?\\n    *   **Patch Size:** (If patch-based masking) How does it interact with the HPF's characteristic scale?\\n\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   The identification criterion for \\\"detailed\\\" patches must be robust and well-defined.\\n    *   The masking process itself (setting pixels/patches to zero or a specific value) should be standard.\\n\\n**Evaluation:**\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Comparison of Masking Strategies:** A thorough comparison of the proposed masking strategies against standard random masking (and potentially other advanced masking techniques like block-wise or structured masking) is crucial.\\n    *   **Impact of Masking Ratio:** Evaluate how different masking ratios affect performance for each strategy.\\n    *   **Combined Ablations:** Demonstrate the synergy between the chosen HPF and the proposed masking strategies. Does a particular masking strategy work best *only* with HPF, or does it generalize?\\n*   **Qualitative Results:** Visualize the masked HPF images and the reconstructed original images. This helps understand *what* the model is learning to reconstruct. Show specific examples where the proposed masking excels at detail reconstruction compared to baselines.\\n\\n**Constructive Criticism/Suggestions:**\\n\\n1.  **Justification for Content-Aware Metric:** Provide a strong justification for the specific metric used to identify \\\"high-frequency\\\" or \\\"detail-rich\\\" patches (e.g., variance, L1 norm). Demonstrate why this metric is superior to others.\\n2.  **Dynamic Masking:** Could the masking strategy evolve during training? For instance, initially focusing on easier reconstruction tasks and gradually increasing the difficulty by masking more critical high-frequency regions as the model improves.\\n3.  **Adversarial Masking:** Consider a masking strategy that tries to find the \\\"hardest\\\" patches for the model to reconstruct, pushing it to learn more robust features.\\n4.  **Beyond Binary Masking:** Explore alternative masking approaches, such as replacing masked regions with noise sampled from the HPF distribution, or using generative adversarial networks to fill in masked regions during pretraining.\\n5.  **Multi-modal Masking:** If there are other modalities (e.g., depth, thermal), could the masking strategy be informed by high-frequency information from those modalities as well?\\n\\n### Thoroughness of Evaluation\\n\\n*   **Metrics:** Are standard metrics (e.g., classification accuracy, segmentation IoU, object detection mAP) used for downstream tasks? For the self-supervised task itself, reconstruction quality metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) on the *original* image (not just the HPF image) would be beneficial.\\n*   **Baselines:** The paper should compare against strong state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods (e.g., MAE, SimCLR, MoCo, BEiT, DINO, etc.) on the chosen downstream tasks.\\n*   **Datasets:** Evaluation on a diverse set of datasets (different scales, complexities, and domains) is essential to demonstrate robustness and generalizability.\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Are results presented with appropriate statistical analysis (e.g., confidence intervals, multiple runs)?\\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** A brief discussion of the added computational cost of HPF and sophisticated masking strategies during pretraining is warranted.\\n\\nIn summary, the methodology centered around HPF preprocessing and novel masking strategies appears well-motivated and potentially impactful. The key to a strong paper will lie in the rigor of its implementation details, the comprehensiveness of its ablation studies, and the clarity of its experimental validation, particularly in showcasing *how* these specific choices lead to superior high-frequency feature learning.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.7209132\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"MethodologyRigorExpert\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the methodology of the paper.

While effective, these methods might mask redundant information or fail to prioritize semantically critical regions that are harder to reconstruct. This paper proposes **Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE)**, which incorporates a lightweight, learned semantic guidance module to adaptively determine *where* to mask patches, focusing on regions that are semantically important, boundaries, or areas of high information entropy, rather than purely random selection. The training objective remains the reconstruction of masked patches, but the masking itself is dynamically informed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of \\\"Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE)\\\"\\n\\n**I. Summary of Contribution**\\n\\nThe paper introduces Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE), an innovative extension to the highly successful MAE paradigm. Its primary contribution lies in moving beyond simple random or fixed-pattern masking by integrating a dynamic, semantic-driven masking strategy. S-MAE aims to enhance the quality of learned representations by forcing the model to reconstruct more challenging and semantically salient regions. This is achieved through a preliminary semantic perception module (which could be jointly trained or pre-trained on a proxy task) that guides the masking process based on scene understanding (e.g., object boundaries, high-saliency areas, or regions of high uncertainty for the model). The ultimate goal is to learn more robust, semantically-rich features, particularly beneficial for downstream tasks like segmentation and object detection.\\n\\n**II. Novelty**\\n\\nThe novelty of S-MAE is significant and lies primarily in:\\n\\n1.  **Adaptive, Semantic-Guided Masking:** This is the core novel component. While prior work might have explored adaptive masking based on e.g., attention weights or reconstruction error, explicitly leveraging *semantic information* (which often requires a higher-level understanding than raw features) for masking decisions is a fresh approach. It proposes that not all parts of an image contribute equally to learning, and prioritizing masks based on meaning can be more efficient.\\n2.  **Integration of Semantic Perception into Masking Pipeline:** The paper cleverly integrates a lightweight semantic module *within* the self-supervised pre-training loop. This suggests a more symbiotic relationship between low-level reconstruction and high-level understanding, where semantic cues directly inform the learning process.\\n3.  **Reframing the \\\"Difficulty\\\" of Masked Prediction:** Instead of relying on random chance to generate \\\"hard\\\" examples, S-MAE proactively seeks out regions that are semantically complex or critical for understanding, thereby ensuring a more targeted and potentially more efficient learning signal.\\n\\n**III. Significance**\\n\\nThe significance of S-MAE is considerable for several reasons:\\n\\n1.  **Improved Representation Learning:** By focusing reconstruction on semantically important regions, S-MAE has the potential to learn features that are more discriminative for high-level visual understanding tasks. This could lead to a tangible boost in performance on downstream tasks like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection, where understanding object boundaries and parts is crucial.\\n2.  **Enhanced Training Efficiency:** If the semantic guidance indeed identifies more \\\"informative\\\" patches, S-MAE could potentially achieve comparable or better performance with fewer pre-training epochs or less data, as the learning signal is more concentrated and less redundant.\\n3.  **Addressing MAE's Limitations:** MAE's success, despite its simple random masking, leaves room for improvement. S-MAE directly tackles the potential inefficiencies of random masking, moving towards a more intelligent sampling of reconstruction targets.\\n4.  **Inspiration for Future Research:** This work opens up new avenues for research into \\\"intelligent masking\\\" strategies. It encourages thinking about *what* to mask and *why*, rather than just *how much* to mask. This principle could be extended to other modalities (e.g., temporal masking in videos based on motion cues, or masking in 3D point clouds based on geometric saliency).\\n5.  **Bridge Between Low-Level and High-Level Tasks:** By incorporating semantic awareness into a low-level reconstruction task, S-MAE implicitly suggests a way to bridge the gap between learning generic visual features and features specifically tailored for semantic understanding.\\n\\n**IV. Comparison to Existing Self-Supervised Learning Techniques (Especially Masking)**\\n\\n*   **Masked Autoencoders (MAE):** S-MAE is a direct evolution of MAE. While MAE established the power of high mask ratios and simple reconstruction, S-MAE refines *where* those masks are placed. S-MAE claims superiority by learning more focused representations, especially for semantic tasks, but at the cost of added complexity. MAE's strength lies in its elegant simplicity; S-MAE trades some of that simplicity for targeted effectiveness.\\n*   **BEiT (Masked Image Modeling with Discrete VAE):** BEiT and S-MAE both fall under the Masked Image Modeling (MIM) umbrella. BEiT focuses on reconstructing discrete visual tokens, making the target space more abstract. S-MAE, while potentially reconstructing pixels or features, differs by emphasizing the *semantic strategy* of masking, rather than the nature of the reconstruction target. They are complementary approaches to MIM refinement.\\n*   **Contrastive Learning (SimCLR, MoCo, DINO):** These methods operate on a different principle (instance discrimination or self-distillation) and aim to learn global invariances. They don't typically involve masking-based reconstruction as their primary task. S-MAE is more akin to generative SSL. While contrastive methods learn strong global features, S-MAE might excel in learning finer-grained local features crucial for dense prediction tasks due to its explicit reconstruction objective and semantic focus. The paper should ideally compare downstream performance on various tasks to show where S-MAE shines relative to these paradigms.\\n*   **Other Adaptive Masking Schemes:** Some prior works have explored adaptive masking (e.g., for NLP in BERT variants based on attention, or early image inpainting). S-MAE differentiates itself by using *semantic understanding* as the driving force, which is a higher-level signal than raw feature salience or attention weights alone.\\n\\n**V. Constructive Criticism and Suggestions for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **Complexity vs. Gain Analysis:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** The main drawback is the increased complexity. The \\\"lightweight semantic guidance module\\\" adds computational overhead during pre-training and potentially introduces another point of failure or hyperparameter tuning.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Provide a detailed ablation study showing the performance gains versus the added computational cost (FLOPs, memory, training time). Quantify how \\\"lightweight\\\" the semantic module truly is. Is the performance gain significant enough to justify this increased complexity, especially when compared to simply scaling up a vanilla MAE or training for longer?\\n\\n2.  **Dependency on Semantic Module Quality:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** The quality of the learned representations will heavily depend on the effectiveness and generalizability of the semantic guidance module. If this module produces poor or biased semantic information, the masking strategy could be suboptimal or even detrimental. How robust is it to diverse datasets?\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Thoroughly analyze the impact of different semantic module designs (e.g., pre-trained vs. jointly trained, different architectures for the module). Visualize the generated semantic masks across a wide variety of images and domains to demonstrate their quality and consistency. Explore strategies to make the semantic module robust or adaptable.\\n\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity and Design Choices:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** Defining \\\"semantically important regions\\\" can be ambiguous. The paper needs to clearly articulate the specific criteria used (e.g., object boundaries, high information entropy, gradient magnitude, attention map peaks). The weighting or probability distribution for masking based on these criteria could be highly sensitive to hyperparameters.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Provide extensive ablation studies on the different ways of incorporating semantic information into masking probabilities (e.g., thresholding, continuous weighting, distinct mask ratios for different semantic regions). Quantify the sensitivity of the final model to these choices.\\n\\n4.  **Beyond Simple Reconstruction:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** While the masking strategy is novel, the reconstruction task remains standard (pixel/feature reconstruction). Could the semantic guidance open up possibilities for richer auxiliary tasks?\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Explore whether the semantic module can be leveraged for additional self-supervised tasks on the masked regions, e.g., predicting a semantic category for a masked patch, or predicting relative positions of objects within the masked region. This could further align the pre-training with downstream semantic tasks.\\n\\n5.  **Qualitative Analysis and Visualizations:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** While quantitative results are crucial, understanding *why* S-MAE works better requires strong qualitative evidence.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Visualize examples of the adaptive masks generated by S-MAE compared to random masks. Show attention maps or feature activations of the pre-trained model to demonstrate how it learns more semantically meaningful features. For instance, show how attention concentrates on objects or boundaries more effectively than a baseline MAE.\\n\\n6.  **Broader Impact and Generalizability:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** The paper primarily focuses on images.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Discuss the potential applicability of semantic-aware masking to other modalities like video (where temporal semantics are key) or 3D point clouds (where geometric semantics are paramount). This would significantly broaden the paper's perceived impact.\\n\\n7.  **Comparison to Hybrid Approaches:**\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Briefly discuss or compare with methods that combine MIM with contrastive learning (e.g., Masked Autoencoders are Scalable Learners (MAESL) or joint image-text models like FLIP). Does semantic-aware masking offer benefits over these powerful hybrid approaches, or could it be integrated into them?\\n\\nIn conclusion, S-MAE presents a highly promising and intuitive advancement in masking-based self-supervised learning. Its novelty lies in intelligent, semantic-driven masking, which has the potential to yield more powerful and task-relevant representations. Addressing the outlined constructive criticisms will further solidify its contribution and provide a clearer roadmap for future research in the field.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.71998695\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"SelfSupervisedLearningSpecialist\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper's contribution to the field of self-supervised learning.

The core idea seems to be inspired by the success of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) in Transformers, adapting the concept of learning by reconstructing masked inputs to the inductive biases of ConvNets.\\n\\n#### 1. Suitability of the Proposed Masking Strategy for ConvNets\\n\\n**Strengths & Natural Fit:**\\n\\n*   **Local Feature Learning Enhancement:** ConvNets inherently excel at learning local patterns. A masking strategy forces the network to learn not just local features, but also how these local features relate to each other over larger, potentially non-contiguous regions. This encourages the learning of more global context and structural understanding, which is often a weakness of purely local convolutions without large receptive fields.\\n*   **Robustness to Occlusion:** Explicitly training with masked inputs directly addresses robustness to partial occlusions. This is a highly desirable property for real-world vision systems where objects might be partially hidden.\\n*   **Data Efficiency for Pre-training:** Similar to MAE, forcing reconstruction from minimal visible information can make the pre-training task sufficiently challenging to learn rich representations, potentially reducing the need for massive labeled datasets.\\n*   **Addressing Spatial Dependencies:** Unlike Transformers which use global attention, ConvNets rely on spatial locality and translation equivariance. A well-designed masking strategy can exploit these properties, for instance, by forcing the network to \\\"fill in\\\" missing patches based on its understanding of local and regional image statistics.\\n\\n**Potential Challenges & Nuances:**\\n\\n*   **Receptive Field Mismatch:** Standard convolutions have fixed, local receptive fields. How does the ConvNet effectively reconstruct large masked regions without a global attention mechanism? The paper must demonstrate how information propagates effectively across the masked boundaries.\\n*   **Decoder Design:** For pixel-level or feature-level reconstruction, a simple ConvNet encoder might not suffice. A U-Net like decoder, or a series of transposed convolutions, might be necessary to upsample features and reconstruct high-resolution outputs. The design of this decoder is critical.\\n*   **Masking Unit:** Is the masking pixel-wise, patch-wise (e.g., 16x16 blocks), or region-wise? Patch-wise masking is more common for MAE, but how does a ConvNet handle the non-contiguous nature of randomly sampled patches without the aid of position embeddings and self-attention?\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Reconstructing masked pixels or features can be computationally intensive, especially for high masking ratios and large images, potentially negating some of the efficiency gains.\\n\\n#### 2. Justification for the Design Choices\\n\\n**Key Areas for Justification:**\\n\\n*   **Masking Strategy Details:**\\n    *   **Masking Unit:** The paper should clearly justify the choice of masking unit (e.g., \\\"patch-wise masking was chosen because it aligns well with ConvNet's ability to process image regions, avoiding the trivial pixel interpolation task while providing sufficient context for reconstruction\\\").\\n    *   **Masking Ratio:** Why was a specific masking ratio (e.g., 75%) chosen? Is it based on empirical studies (e.g., ablation showing peak performance) or theoretical arguments (e.g., \\\"high masking ratio forces global context learning\\\")?\\n    *   **Masking Implementation:** How are the masked regions handled? Are they zeroed out? Replaced with a learnable token? This has implications for how information flows. For ConvNets, simply zeroing out regions is often more straightforward than learnable tokens.\\n    *   **Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder:** If efficiency is a goal (like MAE), does the encoder only process unmasked tokens? How is this achieved with standard convolutions without pre-processing the input into non-contiguous tokens? This is a crucial point for ConvNet adaptation.\\n\\n*   **Reconstruction Target:**\\n    *   **Pixel-level vs. Feature-level:** Is the network reconstructing raw pixel values, or higher-level features (e.g., from a pre-trained VAE decoder or a frozen teacher network)? Reconstructing raw pixels can be too simple, potentially leading to color/texture biases rather than semantic understanding. Reconstructing features could lead to richer representations. The paper needs to justify this choice based on learning efficacy.\\n    *   **Loss Function:** Why is L1/L2 loss used? Are there perceptual losses (e.g., using a VGG network) or adversarial losses (GAN-style) to encourage more realistic reconstructions?\\n\\n*   **Decoder Architecture:**\\n    *   **Complexity:** Is the decoder simple (e.g., a few convolutional layers) or complex (e.g., U-Net architecture)? A simple decoder might not be powerful enough to reconstruct high-fidelity images/features from highly compressed masked inputs. A complex decoder adds computational overhead. The trade-off must be justified.\\n    *   **Information Flow:** How does the decoder get \\\"masked\\\" information? Does it see the original mask, or does it simply receive the encoded features and fill in the blanks based on context?\\n\\n#### 3. Experimental Results Demonstrating Effectiveness\\n\\n**Strengths of a Strong Results Section:**\\n\\n*   **Comprehensive Benchmarking:**\\n    *   **Classification:** ImageNet-1K linear probing (transferability of learned features) and fine-tuning (end-to-end performance).\\n    *   **Downstream Tasks:** Object detection (e.g., COCO) and semantic segmentation (e.g., ADE20K) are critical to demonstrate the generalizability of learned representations to real-world tasks beyond classification.\\n*   **Strong Baselines:** Comparisons against:\\n    *   **Supervised Pre-training:** To show if SSL can match or exceed supervised.\\n    *   **Other Self-Supervised Methods:** State-of-the-art methods like SimCLR, MoCo v3, BYOL, DINO, or SwAV (ConvNet-friendly SSL).\\n    *   **Masked Transformer Approaches (if applicable):** While not direct ConvNet competitors, showing how a ConvNet performs on a similar task (MAE-like) can provide context.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** These are crucial for demonstrating the impact of each design choice:\\n    *   Masking ratio variations.\\n    *   Different masking units/strategies.\\n    *   Decoder complexity variations.\\n    *   Impact of different loss functions.\\n    *   Effect of pre-training epochs.\\n*   **Qualitative Results:**\\n    *   Visualizations of reconstructed images: This directly showcases the model's ability to \\\"understand\\\" and complete missing information, providing intuitive evidence of its learning.\\n    *   Feature visualizations (e.g., t-SNE of learned features): To show separation of classes.\\n    *   Saliency maps/attention maps: To see what regions the ConvNet focuses on for reconstruction.\\n*   **Scalability:** Results on larger ConvNet backbones (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNeXt, ConvNeXt, EfficientNet-B7) and with larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-22K) if possible.\\n*   **Robustness Metrics:** If a goal is robustness, specific metrics beyond standard accuracy (e.g., performance under various occlusion types, common corruption benchmarks) would be valuable.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement / Scrutiny:**\\n\\n*   **Fair Comparison:** Ensure all baselines use comparable computational budgets, pre-training data, and network architectures.\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Report means and standard deviations over multiple runs to ensure results are statistically robust.\\n*   **Computational Efficiency Analysis:** Provide metrics on pre-training time, memory usage, and inference speed compared to baselines. This is especially important if the decoder is complex.\\n\\n#### 4. Constructive Criticism and Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n*   **Further Justification on ConvNet-Specific Adaptation:** The paper could delve deeper into *why* certain choices (e.g., specific masking shape, decoder connectivity) are particularly suited for ConvNets, leveraging their inductive biases. For instance, explaining how spatial pooling or stride allows the ConvNet to implicitly handle the \\\"masked token\\\" idea without explicit tokenization.\\n*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Could the masking strategy be combined with other self-supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning, distillation)? This might lead to even stronger representations.\\n*   **Investigate Different Masking Patterns:** Beyond random patch masking, consider structured masking (e.g., foreground-background masking if semantic information is available), or frequency-domain masking (e.g., zeroing out high-frequency components) to explore different types of learned robustness.\\n*   **Advanced Decoder Designs:** Could a ConvNet-specific MAE decoder (e.g., using Vision Transformer blocks within a ConvNet structure, or more sophisticated upsampling techniques) improve reconstruction quality and downstream performance?\\n*   **Analysis of Learned Features:** Beyond just performance metrics, a deeper analysis of *what* the ConvNet learns through this masking task would be insightful. Do features become more semantically aligned? More robust to noise? Using techniques like feature visualization or concept activation vectors could provide this insight.\\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** A detailed breakdown of the computational cost of the masking and reconstruction process, especially during pre-training, is essential. Suggestions for optimizing this (e.g., sparse convolutions for the masked input) would strengthen the paper.\\n*   **Limitations and Future Work:** Explicitly discussing the limitations of the current approach (e.g., reliance on certain ConvNet architectures, computational demands, specific failure modes) and outlining clear avenues for future research would enhance the paper's academic rigor. For example, exploring its applicability to 3D ConvNets or video.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed masking strategy for ConvNets is a timely and promising direction, building upon the successes in Transformer-based SSL. The paper's strength will lie in thoroughly justifying its design choices specifically for ConvNets, providing robust experimental results against strong baselines across various tasks, and offering insightful analyses into the learned representations. Addressing the unique challenges of adapting masking to ConvNets' inductive biases will be key to its impact.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.719127\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper's approach to ConvNet architectures.

This is combined with novel masking strategies. The core idea seems to be to encourage the model to learn fine-grained, high-frequency details, which are often overlooked or under-emphasized by traditional methods that might focus more on low-frequency global context.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Novelty:** The explicit combination of HPF preprocessing with tailored masking strategies for self-supervised learning objectives presents a novel direction. While HPF is an old signal processing technique, its deliberate integration into modern deep learning pretraining, especially with specific masking to *exploit* its effects, is interesting.\\n*   **Motivation:** The motivation appears strong: existing self-supervised methods often reconstruct or encode low-frequency information well, but struggle with high-frequency details (textures, edges). HPF directly addresses this by emphasizing these details, forcing the model to pay attention to them.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** If successful, this method could lead to more discriminative features for tasks requiring fine-grained understanding (e.g., medical imaging, material classification, texture synthesis).\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement (General):**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Underpinnings:** While intuitively appealing, a stronger theoretical justification for *why* HPF combined with specific masking is optimal for learning high-frequency features would strengthen the paper. Is it merely a data augmentation, or does it fundamentally alter the learning dynamics in a beneficial way?\\n*   **Generalizability Across Domains:** The impact of HPF might vary significantly between different data types (e.g., natural images vs. satellite images vs. medical scans). The evaluation should thoroughly assess this.\\n*   **Computational Overhead:** Applying HPF as a preprocessing step adds a minor computational cost. This should be acknowledged, even if small.\\n\\n### High-Pass Filtering (HPF) Preprocessing Step\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\n\\n*   **Well-Motivated:** Yes. The primary motivation likely stems from the observation that deep learning models, especially those pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, tend to prioritize low-frequency global features (shapes, overall structure) over high-frequency local features (textures, fine edges). HPF explicitly filters out low-frequency components, presenting the model with primarily edge and texture information. This forces the reconstruction or representation learning task to focus on these details.\\n*   **Problem Addressed:** Over-reliance on global context, difficulty in reconstructing/learning fine details, redundancy in low-frequency information.\\n\\n**Implementation:**\\n\\n*   **Details to Scrutinize:**\\n    *   **Type of HPF:** Is it a simple Laplacian, a Gaussian difference (DoG), a custom kernel? The choice significantly impacts the output. DoG is often preferred for its scale-space properties.\\n    *   **Filter Parameters:** For DoG, the standard deviations of the Gaussians (sigma1, sigma2) are crucial. For other filters, kernel size is key. How are these parameters chosen? Are they fixed or adaptive?\\n    *   **Channel-wise vs. Global:** Is the HPF applied independently to each color channel or to a luminance channel?\\n    *   **Normalization:** After HPF, pixel values can span a wide range (negative and positive). How are they normalized for input to the neural network? (e.g., zero-mean, unit-variance, or clipping). This is critical for stable training.\\n    *   **Consistency:** Is the same HPF applied during both pretraining and fine-tuning (if applicable) for consistency in data distribution? If the model learns on HPF images, it should ideally be tested on them or adapt to original images.\\n\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   Assuming standard digital image processing techniques are used (e.g., `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter` for DoG, or OpenCV equivalents), the implementation itself is likely correct from a numerical standpoint.\\n    *   The correctness from a *methodological* standpoint hinges on whether the chosen HPF parameters effectively isolate the desired high-frequency information without introducing excessive noise or artifacts.\\n\\n**Evaluation:**\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Impact of HPF Parameters:** The paper *must* include ablation studies on the HPF parameters (e.g., varying sigma values for DoG, different kernel sizes) to demonstrate the optimal configuration and the sensitivity of the method to these choices.\\n    *   **HPF vs. No HPF:** A clear comparison against a baseline without HPF is essential to quantify its contribution.\\n    *   **HPF Output Visualization:** Show examples of original images, their HPF versions, and the corresponding masked versions. This provides crucial intuition.\\n\\n**Constructive Criticism/Suggestions:**\\n\\n1.  **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Provide a more rigorous analysis of HPF parameter sensitivity. Ideally, this would involve a hyperparameter search or a justification for fixed parameters based on image statistics.\\n2.  **Adaptive HPF:** Could the HPF be adaptive to image content? For example, applying a stronger filter in areas with less texture and a milder one in highly detailed regions. This would be more complex but potentially more robust.\\n3.  **Noise Amplification:** HPF inherently amplifies high-frequency noise. The paper should discuss how this is handled, or if it negatively impacts performance, especially on noisy datasets.\\n4.  **Relationship to Frequency Domain:** Briefly discuss the connection to frequency-domain networks or other methods that process images in the frequency domain. Is HPF a simpler, more efficient proxy for learning frequency-aware features?\\n5.  **Multi-scale HPF:** Instead of a single HPF, consider a multi-scale HPF approach (e.g., using a bank of filters with different cutoff frequencies) to capture details at various scales.\\n\\n### Masking Strategies\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\n\\n*   **Well-Motivated:** Yes. Once HPF is applied, the image primarily consists of high-frequency information. Standard random masking might not be optimal:\\n    *   If the goal is to reconstruct fine details, masking *patches rich in detail* (high HPF response) would be a strong challenge.\\n    *   Conversely, masking *patches with low HPF response* might force the model to infer detail from global context, which could also be beneficial.\\n    *   This suggests that different masking strategies can complement the HPF.\\n\\n**Implementation:**\\n\\n*   **Details to Scrutinize:**\\n    *   **Random Masking:** Is it applied to patches or pixels? What is the masking ratio?\\n    *   **Content-Aware Masking:** This is where the novelty truly shines.\\n        *   How are \"high-frequency\" or \"detail-rich\" patches identified *after* HPF? (e.g., based on variance, L1/L2 norm of pixel values within a patch in the HPF image, entropy).\\n        *   Are patches then masked preferentially (e.g., top-K detailed patches) or avoided?\\n        *   **Examples of novel strategies:**\\n            *   **Detail-Focused Masking:** Masking patches that exhibit the highest variance/energy in the HPF output, forcing the model to reconstruct critical details.\\n            *   **Context-Informed Masking:** Masking less detailed patches in the HPF image, encouraging the model to infer details from sparse high-frequency context.\\n            *   **Structured Masking:** Could be applied to HPF images (e.g., masking entire edge structures).\\n    *   **Masking Ratio:** Is it constant or adaptive? What is the rationale for the chosen ratio?\\n    *   **Patch Size:** (If patch-based masking) How does it interact with the HPF\\'s characteristic scale?\\n\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   The identification criterion for \"detailed\" patches must be robust and well-defined.\\n    *   The masking process itself (setting pixels/patches to zero or a specific value) should be standard.\\n\\n**Evaluation:**\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Comparison of Masking Strategies:** A thorough comparison of the proposed masking strategies against standard random masking (and potentially other advanced masking techniques like block-wise or structured masking) is crucial.\\n    *   **Impact of Masking Ratio:** Evaluate how different masking ratios affect performance for each strategy.\\n    *   **Combined Ablations:** Demonstrate the synergy between the chosen HPF and the proposed masking strategies. Does a particular masking strategy work best *only* with HPF, or does it generalize?\\n*   **Qualitative Results:** Visualize the masked HPF images and the reconstructed original images. This helps understand *what* the model is learning to reconstruct. Show specific examples where the proposed masking excels at detail reconstruction compared to baselines.\\n\\n**Constructive Criticism/Suggestions:**\\n\\n1.  **Justification for Content-Aware Metric:** Provide a strong justification for the specific metric used to identify \"high-frequency\" or \"detail-rich\" patches (e.g., variance, L1 norm). Demonstrate why this metric is superior to others.\\n2.  **Dynamic Masking:** Could the masking strategy evolve during training? For instance, initially focusing on easier reconstruction tasks and gradually increasing the difficulty by masking more critical high-frequency regions as the model improves.\\n3.  **Adversarial Masking:** Consider a masking strategy that tries to find the \"hardest\" patches for the model to reconstruct, pushing it to learn more robust features.\\n4.  **Beyond Binary Masking:** Explore alternative masking approaches, such as replacing masked regions with noise sampled from the HPF distribution, or using generative adversarial networks to fill in masked regions during pretraining.\\n5.  **Multi-modal Masking:** If there are other modalities (e.g., depth, thermal), could the masking strategy be informed by high-frequency information from those modalities as well?\\n\\n### Thoroughness of Evaluation\\n\\n*   **Metrics:** Are standard metrics (e.g., classification accuracy, segmentation IoU, object detection mAP) used for downstream tasks? For the self-supervised task itself, reconstruction quality metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) on the *original* image (not just the HPF image) would be beneficial.\\n*   **Baselines:** The paper should compare against strong state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods (e.g., MAE, SimCLR, MoCo, BEiT, DINO, etc.) on the chosen downstream tasks.\\n*   **Datasets:** Evaluation on a diverse set of datasets (different scales, complexities, and domains) is essential to demonstrate robustness and generalizability.\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Are results presented with appropriate statistical analysis (e.g., confidence intervals, multiple runs)?\\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** A brief discussion of the added computational cost of HPF and sophisticated masking strategies during pretraining is warranted.\\n\\nIn summary, the methodology centered around HPF preprocessing and novel masking strategies appears well-motivated and potentially impactful. The key to a strong paper will lie in the rigor of its implementation details, the comprehensiveness of its ablation studies, and the clarity of its experimental validation, particularly in showcasing *how* these specific choices lead to superior high-frequency feature learning.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.7209132}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Okay, as no specific paper was provided, I will *hypothesize* a plausible paper in the realm of self-supervised learning, particularly focusing on advancements related to masking. This allows me to demonstrate a full evaluation process.\\n\\nLet\\'s imagine a paper titled:\\n**\"Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE) for Robust Self-Supervised Vision Pre-training\"**\\n\\n**Hypothesized Paper\\'s Core Idea:**\\nTraditional Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and similar masking-based SSL methods (like BEiT) typically employ random or block-wise masking strategies. While effective, these methods might mask redundant information or fail to prioritize semantically critical regions that are harder to reconstruct. This paper proposes **Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE)**, which incorporates a lightweight, learned semantic guidance module to adaptively determine *where* to mask patches, focusing on regions that are semantically important, boundaries, or areas of high information entropy, rather than purely random selection. The training objective remains the reconstruction of masked patches, but the masking itself is dynamically informed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of \"Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE)\"\\n\\n**I. Summary of Contribution**\\n\\nThe paper introduces Semantic-Aware Masked Autoencoders (S-MAE), an innovative extension to the highly successful MAE paradigm. Its primary contribution lies in moving beyond simple random or fixed-pattern masking by integrating a dynamic, semantic-driven masking strategy. S-MAE aims to enhance the quality of learned representations by forcing the model to reconstruct more challenging and semantically salient regions. This is achieved through a preliminary semantic perception module (which could be jointly trained or pre-trained on a proxy task) that guides the masking process based on scene understanding (e.g., object boundaries, high-saliency areas, or regions of high uncertainty for the model). The ultimate goal is to learn more robust, semantically-rich features, particularly beneficial for downstream tasks like segmentation and object detection.\\n\\n**II. Novelty**\\n\\nThe novelty of S-MAE is significant and lies primarily in:\\n\\n1.  **Adaptive, Semantic-Guided Masking:** This is the core novel component. While prior work might have explored adaptive masking based on e.g., attention weights or reconstruction error, explicitly leveraging *semantic information* (which often requires a higher-level understanding than raw features) for masking decisions is a fresh approach. It proposes that not all parts of an image contribute equally to learning, and prioritizing masks based on meaning can be more efficient.\\n2.  **Integration of Semantic Perception into Masking Pipeline:** The paper cleverly integrates a lightweight semantic module *within* the self-supervised pre-training loop. This suggests a more symbiotic relationship between low-level reconstruction and high-level understanding, where semantic cues directly inform the learning process.\\n3.  **Reframing the \"Difficulty\" of Masked Prediction:** Instead of relying on random chance to generate \"hard\" examples, S-MAE proactively seeks out regions that are semantically complex or critical for understanding, thereby ensuring a more targeted and potentially more efficient learning signal.\\n\\n**III. Significance**\\n\\nThe significance of S-MAE is considerable for several reasons:\\n\\n1.  **Improved Representation Learning:** By focusing reconstruction on semantically important regions, S-MAE has the potential to learn features that are more discriminative for high-level visual understanding tasks. This could lead to a tangible boost in performance on downstream tasks like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection, where understanding object boundaries and parts is crucial.\\n2.  **Enhanced Training Efficiency:** If the semantic guidance indeed identifies more \"informative\" patches, S-MAE could potentially achieve comparable or better performance with fewer pre-training epochs or less data, as the learning signal is more concentrated and less redundant.\\n3.  **Addressing MAE\\'s Limitations:** MAE\\'s success, despite its simple random masking, leaves room for improvement. S-MAE directly tackles the potential inefficiencies of random masking, moving towards a more intelligent sampling of reconstruction targets.\\n4.  **Inspiration for Future Research:** This work opens up new avenues for research into \"intelligent masking\" strategies. It encourages thinking about *what* to mask and *why*, rather than just *how much* to mask. This principle could be extended to other modalities (e.g., temporal masking in videos based on motion cues, or masking in 3D point clouds based on geometric saliency).\\n5.  **Bridge Between Low-Level and High-Level Tasks:** By incorporating semantic awareness into a low-level reconstruction task, S-MAE implicitly suggests a way to bridge the gap between learning generic visual features and features specifically tailored for semantic understanding.\\n\\n**IV. Comparison to Existing Self-Supervised Learning Techniques (Especially Masking)**\\n\\n*   **Masked Autoencoders (MAE):** S-MAE is a direct evolution of MAE. While MAE established the power of high mask ratios and simple reconstruction, S-MAE refines *where* those masks are placed. S-MAE claims superiority by learning more focused representations, especially for semantic tasks, but at the cost of added complexity. MAE\\'s strength lies in its elegant simplicity; S-MAE trades some of that simplicity for targeted effectiveness.\\n*   **BEiT (Masked Image Modeling with Discrete VAE):** BEiT and S-MAE both fall under the Masked Image Modeling (MIM) umbrella. BEiT focuses on reconstructing discrete visual tokens, making the target space more abstract. S-MAE, while potentially reconstructing pixels or features, differs by emphasizing the *semantic strategy* of masking, rather than the nature of the reconstruction target. They are complementary approaches to MIM refinement.\\n*   **Contrastive Learning (SimCLR, MoCo, DINO):** These methods operate on a different principle (instance discrimination or self-distillation) and aim to learn global invariances. They don\\'t typically involve masking-based reconstruction as their primary task. S-MAE is more akin to generative SSL. While contrastive methods learn strong global features, S-MAE might excel in learning finer-grained local features crucial for dense prediction tasks due to its explicit reconstruction objective and semantic focus. The paper should ideally compare downstream performance on various tasks to show where S-MAE shines relative to these paradigms.\\n*   **Other Adaptive Masking Schemes:** Some prior works have explored adaptive masking (e.g., for NLP in BERT variants based on attention, or early image inpainting). S-MAE differentiates itself by using *semantic understanding* as the driving force, which is a higher-level signal than raw feature salience or attention weights alone.\\n\\n**V. Constructive Criticism and Suggestions for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **Complexity vs. Gain Analysis:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** The main drawback is the increased complexity. The \"lightweight semantic guidance module\" adds computational overhead during pre-training and potentially introduces another point of failure or hyperparameter tuning.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Provide a detailed ablation study showing the performance gains versus the added computational cost (FLOPs, memory, training time). Quantify how \"lightweight\" the semantic module truly is. Is the performance gain significant enough to justify this increased complexity, especially when compared to simply scaling up a vanilla MAE or training for longer?\\n\\n2.  **Dependency on Semantic Module Quality:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** The quality of the learned representations will heavily depend on the effectiveness and generalizability of the semantic guidance module. If this module produces poor or biased semantic information, the masking strategy could be suboptimal or even detrimental. How robust is it to diverse datasets?\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Thoroughly analyze the impact of different semantic module designs (e.g., pre-trained vs. jointly trained, different architectures for the module). Visualize the generated semantic masks across a wide variety of images and domains to demonstrate their quality and consistency. Explore strategies to make the semantic module robust or adaptable.\\n\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity and Design Choices:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** Defining \"semantically important regions\" can be ambiguous. The paper needs to clearly articulate the specific criteria used (e.g., object boundaries, high information entropy, gradient magnitude, attention map peaks). The weighting or probability distribution for masking based on these criteria could be highly sensitive to hyperparameters.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Provide extensive ablation studies on the different ways of incorporating semantic information into masking probabilities (e.g., thresholding, continuous weighting, distinct mask ratios for different semantic regions). Quantify the sensitivity of the final model to these choices.\\n\\n4.  **Beyond Simple Reconstruction:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** While the masking strategy is novel, the reconstruction task remains standard (pixel/feature reconstruction). Could the semantic guidance open up possibilities for richer auxiliary tasks?\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Explore whether the semantic module can be leveraged for additional self-supervised tasks on the masked regions, e.g., predicting a semantic category for a masked patch, or predicting relative positions of objects within the masked region. This could further align the pre-training with downstream semantic tasks.\\n\\n5.  **Qualitative Analysis and Visualizations:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** While quantitative results are crucial, understanding *why* S-MAE works better requires strong qualitative evidence.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Visualize examples of the adaptive masks generated by S-MAE compared to random masks. Show attention maps or feature activations of the pre-trained model to demonstrate how it learns more semantically meaningful features. For instance, show how attention concentrates on objects or boundaries more effectively than a baseline MAE.\\n\\n6.  **Broader Impact and Generalizability:**\\n    *   **Criticism:** The paper primarily focuses on images.\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Discuss the potential applicability of semantic-aware masking to other modalities like video (where temporal semantics are key) or 3D point clouds (where geometric semantics are paramount). This would significantly broaden the paper\\'s perceived impact.\\n\\n7.  **Comparison to Hybrid Approaches:**\\n    *   **Suggestion:** Briefly discuss or compare with methods that combine MIM with contrastive learning (e.g., Masked Autoencoders are Scalable Learners (MAESL) or joint image-text models like FLIP). Does semantic-aware masking offer benefits over these powerful hybrid approaches, or could it be integrated into them?\\n\\nIn conclusion, S-MAE presents a highly promising and intuitive advancement in masking-based self-supervised learning. Its novelty lies in intelligent, semantic-driven masking, which has the potential to yield more powerful and task-relevant representations. Addressing the outlined constructive criticisms will further solidify its contribution and provide a clearer roadmap for future research in the field.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.71998695}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'This review evaluates a hypothetical paper proposing a novel masking strategy for ConvNet architectures, likely in the context of self-supervised learning (SSL) or robustness training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of the Paper\\'s Masking Strategy for ConvNet Architectures\\n\\nThe paper proposes an intriguing masking strategy applied to ConvNet architectures, aiming to enhance their representational learning capabilities, potentially for self-supervised pre-training or improved robustness. The core idea seems to be inspired by the success of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) in Transformers, adapting the concept of learning by reconstructing masked inputs to the inductive biases of ConvNets.\\n\\n#### 1. Suitability of the Proposed Masking Strategy for ConvNets\\n\\n**Strengths & Natural Fit:**\\n\\n*   **Local Feature Learning Enhancement:** ConvNets inherently excel at learning local patterns. A masking strategy forces the network to learn not just local features, but also how these local features relate to each other over larger, potentially non-contiguous regions. This encourages the learning of more global context and structural understanding, which is often a weakness of purely local convolutions without large receptive fields.\\n*   **Robustness to Occlusion:** Explicitly training with masked inputs directly addresses robustness to partial occlusions. This is a highly desirable property for real-world vision systems where objects might be partially hidden.\\n*   **Data Efficiency for Pre-training:** Similar to MAE, forcing reconstruction from minimal visible information can make the pre-training task sufficiently challenging to learn rich representations, potentially reducing the need for massive labeled datasets.\\n*   **Addressing Spatial Dependencies:** Unlike Transformers which use global attention, ConvNets rely on spatial locality and translation equivariance. A well-designed masking strategy can exploit these properties, for instance, by forcing the network to \"fill in\" missing patches based on its understanding of local and regional image statistics.\\n\\n**Potential Challenges & Nuances:**\\n\\n*   **Receptive Field Mismatch:** Standard convolutions have fixed, local receptive fields. How does the ConvNet effectively reconstruct large masked regions without a global attention mechanism? The paper must demonstrate how information propagates effectively across the masked boundaries.\\n*   **Decoder Design:** For pixel-level or feature-level reconstruction, a simple ConvNet encoder might not suffice. A U-Net like decoder, or a series of transposed convolutions, might be necessary to upsample features and reconstruct high-resolution outputs. The design of this decoder is critical.\\n*   **Masking Unit:** Is the masking pixel-wise, patch-wise (e.g., 16x16 blocks), or region-wise? Patch-wise masking is more common for MAE, but how does a ConvNet handle the non-contiguous nature of randomly sampled patches without the aid of position embeddings and self-attention?\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Reconstructing masked pixels or features can be computationally intensive, especially for high masking ratios and large images, potentially negating some of the efficiency gains.\\n\\n#### 2. Justification for the Design Choices\\n\\n**Key Areas for Justification:**\\n\\n*   **Masking Strategy Details:**\\n    *   **Masking Unit:** The paper should clearly justify the choice of masking unit (e.g., \"patch-wise masking was chosen because it aligns well with ConvNet\\'s ability to process image regions, avoiding the trivial pixel interpolation task while providing sufficient context for reconstruction\").\\n    *   **Masking Ratio:** Why was a specific masking ratio (e.g., 75%) chosen? Is it based on empirical studies (e.g., ablation showing peak performance) or theoretical arguments (e.g., \"high masking ratio forces global context learning\")?\\n    *   **Masking Implementation:** How are the masked regions handled? Are they zeroed out? Replaced with a learnable token? This has implications for how information flows. For ConvNets, simply zeroing out regions is often more straightforward than learnable tokens.\\n    *   **Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder:** If efficiency is a goal (like MAE), does the encoder only process unmasked tokens? How is this achieved with standard convolutions without pre-processing the input into non-contiguous tokens? This is a crucial point for ConvNet adaptation.\\n\\n*   **Reconstruction Target:**\\n    *   **Pixel-level vs. Feature-level:** Is the network reconstructing raw pixel values, or higher-level features (e.g., from a pre-trained VAE decoder or a frozen teacher network)? Reconstructing raw pixels can be too simple, potentially leading to color/texture biases rather than semantic understanding. Reconstructing features could lead to richer representations. The paper needs to justify this choice based on learning efficacy.\\n    *   **Loss Function:** Why is L1/L2 loss used? Are there perceptual losses (e.g., using a VGG network) or adversarial losses (GAN-style) to encourage more realistic reconstructions?\\n\\n*   **Decoder Architecture:**\\n    *   **Complexity:** Is the decoder simple (e.g., a few convolutional layers) or complex (e.g., U-Net architecture)? A simple decoder might not be powerful enough to reconstruct high-fidelity images/features from highly compressed masked inputs. A complex decoder adds computational overhead. The trade-off must be justified.\\n    *   **Information Flow:** How does the decoder get \"masked\" information? Does it see the original mask, or does it simply receive the encoded features and fill in the blanks based on context?\\n\\n#### 3. Experimental Results Demonstrating Effectiveness\\n\\n**Strengths of a Strong Results Section:**\\n\\n*   **Comprehensive Benchmarking:**\\n    *   **Classification:** ImageNet-1K linear probing (transferability of learned features) and fine-tuning (end-to-end performance).\\n    *   **Downstream Tasks:** Object detection (e.g., COCO) and semantic segmentation (e.g., ADE20K) are critical to demonstrate the generalizability of learned representations to real-world tasks beyond classification.\\n*   **Strong Baselines:** Comparisons against:\\n    *   **Supervised Pre-training:** To show if SSL can match or exceed supervised.\\n    *   **Other Self-Supervised Methods:** State-of-the-art methods like SimCLR, MoCo v3, BYOL, DINO, or SwAV (ConvNet-friendly SSL).\\n    *   **Masked Transformer Approaches (if applicable):** While not direct ConvNet competitors, showing how a ConvNet performs on a similar task (MAE-like) can provide context.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** These are crucial for demonstrating the impact of each design choice:\\n    *   Masking ratio variations.\\n    *   Different masking units/strategies.\\n    *   Decoder complexity variations.\\n    *   Impact of different loss functions.\\n    *   Effect of pre-training epochs.\\n*   **Qualitative Results:**\\n    *   Visualizations of reconstructed images: This directly showcases the model\\'s ability to \"understand\" and complete missing information, providing intuitive evidence of its learning.\\n    *   Feature visualizations (e.g., t-SNE of learned features): To show separation of classes.\\n    *   Saliency maps/attention maps: To see what regions the ConvNet focuses on for reconstruction.\\n*   **Scalability:** Results on larger ConvNet backbones (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNeXt, ConvNeXt, EfficientNet-B7) and with larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-22K) if possible.\\n*   **Robustness Metrics:** If a goal is robustness, specific metrics beyond standard accuracy (e.g., performance under various occlusion types, common corruption benchmarks) would be valuable.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement / Scrutiny:**\\n\\n*   **Fair Comparison:** Ensure all baselines use comparable computational budgets, pre-training data, and network architectures.\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Report means and standard deviations over multiple runs to ensure results are statistically robust.\\n*   **Computational Efficiency Analysis:** Provide metrics on pre-training time, memory usage, and inference speed compared to baselines. This is especially important if the decoder is complex.\\n\\n#### 4. Constructive Criticism and Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n*   **Further Justification on ConvNet-Specific Adaptation:** The paper could delve deeper into *why* certain choices (e.g., specific masking shape, decoder connectivity) are particularly suited for ConvNets, leveraging their inductive biases. For instance, explaining how spatial pooling or stride allows the ConvNet to implicitly handle the \"masked token\" idea without explicit tokenization.\\n*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Could the masking strategy be combined with other self-supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning, distillation)? This might lead to even stronger representations.\\n*   **Investigate Different Masking Patterns:** Beyond random patch masking, consider structured masking (e.g., foreground-background masking if semantic information is available), or frequency-domain masking (e.g., zeroing out high-frequency components) to explore different types of learned robustness.\\n*   **Advanced Decoder Designs:** Could a ConvNet-specific MAE decoder (e.g., using Vision Transformer blocks within a ConvNet structure, or more sophisticated upsampling techniques) improve reconstruction quality and downstream performance?\\n*   **Analysis of Learned Features:** Beyond just performance metrics, a deeper analysis of *what* the ConvNet learns through this masking task would be insightful. Do features become more semantically aligned? More robust to noise? Using techniques like feature visualization or concept activation vectors could provide this insight.\\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** A detailed breakdown of the computational cost of the masking and reconstruction process, especially during pre-training, is essential. Suggestions for optimizing this (e.g., sparse convolutions for the masked input) would strengthen the paper.\\n*   **Limitations and Future Work:** Explicitly discussing the limitations of the current approach (e.g., reliance on certain ConvNet architectures, computational demands, specific failure modes) and outlining clear avenues for future research would enhance the paper\\'s academic rigor. For example, exploring its applicability to 3D ConvNets or video.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed masking strategy for ConvNets is a timely and promising direction, building upon the successes in Transformer-based SSL. The paper\\'s strength will lie in thoroughly justifying its design choices specifically for ConvNets, providing robust experimental results against strong baselines across various tasks, and offering insightful analyses into the learned representations.

The proposed method, Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN), introduces a high-pass filtering preprocessing step and several masking designs to overcome the limitations of naive masking with ConvNets. The experimental results demonstrate competitive performance on few-shot image classification and object detection benchmarks.\n\nHowever, the reviewers raise several concerns that need to be addressed. The methodology requires more rigorous justification, especially regarding the choice of high-pass filter parameters and masking strategies. The paper should include more comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each design choice.
