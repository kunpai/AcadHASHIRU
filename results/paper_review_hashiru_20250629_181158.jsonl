The paper title is: Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Sampling from unnormalized density is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, especially for posterior sampling. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Welling & Teh, 2011; Hoffman et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014) and Variational inference (VI) (Ranganath et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al., 2017) are two mainstream solutions: MCMC is asymptotically unbiased but sample-exhausted; VI is computationally efficient but usually biased. Recently, particle-based VI algorithms (Liu & Wang, 2016; Detommaso et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) tend to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between particle samples and the posterior, and absorb the advantages of both MCMC and VI: (1) non-parametric flexibility and asymptotic unbiasedness; (2) sample efficiency with the interaction between particles; (3) deterministic updates. Thus, these algorithms are competitive in sampling tasks, such as Bayesian inference (Liu & Wang, 2016; Feng et al., 2017; Detommaso et al., 2018), probabilistic models (Wang & Liu, 2016; Pu et al., 2017). Given a target distribution p\u2217(x), particle-based VI aims to find g(t, x), so that starting with X0 \u223c p0, the distribution p(t, x) of the following method: dXt = g(t,Xt)dt, converges to p\u2217(x) as t \u2192 \u221e. By continuity equation (Jordan et al., 1998), we can capture the evolution of p(t, x) by \u2202p(t, x) \u2202t = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (p(t, x)g(t, x)) . (1) In order to measure the \u201ccloseness\u201d between p(t, \u00b7) and p\u2217, we typically adopt the KL divergence, DKL(t) = \u222b p(t, x) ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) dx. (2) Using chain rule and integration by parts, we have dDKL(t) dt = \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 g(t, x) + g(t, x)\u22a4\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx, (3) which captures the evolution of KL divergence. To minimize the KL divergence, one needs to define a \u201cgradient\u201d to update the particles as our g(t, x). The most standard approach, Wasserstein gradient (Ambrosio et al., 2005), defines a gradient for p(t, x) in the Wasserstein space, which contains probability measures with bounded second moments. In particular, for any functional L that maps probability density p(t, x) to a non-negative scalar, we say that the particle density p(t, x) follows the Wasserstein gradient flow of L if g(t, x) is the gradient field of L2(Rd)-functional derivative of L (Villani, 2009). For KL divergence, the solution is \u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t,x) . However, the computation of deterministic and time-inhomogeneous Wasserstein gradient is non-trivial. It is necessary to restrict the function class of g(t, x) to obtain a tractable form. Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is the most popular particle-based algorithm, which provides a tractable form to update particles with the kernelized gradient flow (Chewi et al., 2020; Liu, 2017). It updates particles by minimizing the KL divergence with a functional gradient measured in RKHS. By restricting the functional gradient with bounded RKHS norm, it has an explicit formulation: g(t, x) can be obtained by minimizing Eq. (3). Nonetheless, there are still some limitations due to the restriction of RKHS: (1) the expressive power is limited because kernel method is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality (Geenens, 2011); (2) with n particles, the O(n2) computational overhead of kernel matrix is required. Further, we identify another crucial limitation of SVGD: the kernel design is highly non-trivial. Even in the simple Gaussian case, where particles start with N (0, I) and p\u2217 = N (\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217), commonly used kernels such as linear and RBF kernel, have fundamental drawbacks in SVGD algorithm (Example 1). Our motivation originates from functional gradient boosting (Friedman, 2001; Nitanda & Suzuki, 2018; Johnson & Zhang, 2019). For each p(t, x), we find a proper function as g(t, x) in the function class F to minimize Eq. (3). In this context, we design a regularizer for the functional gradient to approximate variants of \u201cgradient\u201d explicitly. We propose a regularization family to penalize the particle distribution\u2019s functional gradient output. For well-conditioned \u2212\u22072 ln p\u22171, we can approximate the Wasserstein gradient directly; For ill-conditioned \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217, we can adapt our regularizer to approximate a preconditioned one. Thus, our functional gradient is an approximation to the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient. Regarding the function space, we do not restrict the function in RKHS. Instead, we can use non-linear function classes such as neural networks to obtain a better approximation capacity. The flexibility of the function space can lead to a better sampling algorithm, which is supported by our empirical results. Contributions. We propose a particle-based VI framework with regularized functional gradient flow. Specifically, we choose a special family of regularizers to approximate preconditioned Wasserstein gradient flow, which is more effective than SVGD: The non-linear function classes (such as neural networks) have better expressive capacity than RKHS; The functional gradient in our framework explicitly approximates the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient, which supports ill-conditioned cases and obtains provable convergence rate; Our proposed algorithm does not need the O(n2) kernel matrix, leading to computational efficiency when particle size is large. Both theoretical and empirical results show the effectiveness of our framework. 2 ANALYSIS: Notations. In this paper, we use x to denote particle samples in Rd. The distributions are assumed to be absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. The probability density function of the posterior is denoted by p\u2217. p(t, x) (or pt) refers to particle distribution at time t. For scalar function p(t, x), \u2207xp(t, x) denotes its gradient w.r.t. x. For vector function g(t, x), \u2207xg(t, x), \u2207x \u00b7 g(t, x), \u22072xg(t, x) denote its Jacobian matrix, divergence, Hessian w.r.t. x. \u2202p(t,x) \u2202t and \u2202g(t,x) \u2202t denotes the partial derivative w.r.t. t. Without ambiguity, \u2207 stands for \u2207x for conciseness. Notation \u2225x\u22252H stands for x\u22a4Hx and \u2225x\u2225I is denoted by \u2225x\u2225. Notation \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225Hd denotes the RKHS norm on Rd. We let g(t, x) belong to a vector-valued function class F , and find the best functional gradient direction. Inspired by the gradient boosting algorithm for regression and classification problems, we approximate the gradient flow by a function g(t, x) \u2208 F with a regularization term, which solves the 1For any matrix, condition number is the ratio of the maximal to the minimal eigenvalues. A low condition number is well-conditioned, while a high condition number is ill-conditioned. following minimization formulation: g(t, x) = argmin f\u2208F [ \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 f(x) + f(x)\u22a4\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)]dx+Q(f) ] , (4) where Q(\u00b7) is a regularization term that limit the output magnitude of f . This regularization term also implicitly determines the underlying \u201cdistance metric\u201d used to define the gradient estimates g(t, x) in our framework. When Q(x) = 12 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f(x)\u22252dx, Eq. (4) is equivalent to g(t, x) = argmin f\u2208F \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225f(x)\u2212\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)pt(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 dx. (5) If F is well-specified, i.e., \u2207 ln p\u2217(x)pt(x) \u2208 F , we have g(t, x) = \u2207 ln p\u2217(x) pt(x) , which is the direction of Wasserstein gradient flow. Interestingly, despite the computational intractability of Wasserstein gradient, Eq. (4) provides a tractable variational approximation. For RKHS, we will show that SVGD is a special case of Eq. (4), where Q(f) = 12\u2225f\u2225 2 Hd (Sec. 3.2.1). We point out that RKHS norm cannot regularize the functional gradient properly since it is fixed for any p(t, x). Our next example shows that SVGD is a suboptimal solution for Gaussian case. Example 1. Consider that p(t, \u00b7) is N (\u00b5t,\u03a3t), p\u2217 is N (\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217). We consider the SVGD algorithm with linear kernel, RBF kernel, and regularized functional gradient formulation with Q(f) = 1 2Ept\u2225f\u2225 2, and Q(f) = 12Ept\u2225f\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 . Starting with N (0, I), Fig. 1 plots the g(0, x) with different Q and the optimal transport direction; the path of \u00b5t and p(5, x) are illustrated in Fig. 2. The detailed mathematical derivation are provided in the Appendix. Example 1 shows the comparison of different regularizations for the functional gradient. For RKHS norm, we consider the most commonly used kernels: linear and RBF. Fig. 1 shows the g(0, x) of different regularizers: it is clear that only Q(f) = 12Ept\u2225f\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 approximates the optimal transport direction, while other g(0, x) deviates significantly. SVGD with linear kernel underestimates the gradient of large-variance directions; SVGD with RBF kernel even suffers from gradient vanishing in low-density area. Fig. 2 demonstrates the path of \u00b5t with different regularizers. For linear kernel, due to the curl component (\u00b5\u2217\u00b5\u22a4t term in linear SVGD is non-symmetric; See Appendix for details), p(5, x) is rotated with an angle. For RBF kernel, it is misspecified (linear functions are not in F), leading to slow convergence. The L2 regularizer is suboptimal due to the ill-conditioned \u03a3\u2217. We can see that Q(f) = 12Ept\u2225f\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 produces the optimal path for \u00b5t (the line between \u00b50 and \u00b5\u2217). 2.1 GENERAL REGULARIZATION: Inspired by the Gaussian case, we consider the general form Q(f(x)) = 1 2 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f(x)\u22252Hdx (6) where H is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Proposition 1 shows that with Eq. (6), the resulting functional gradient is the approximation of preconditioned Wasserstein gradient flow. It also implies the well-definedness and existence of g(t, x) when F is closed, since \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225H is lower bounded by 0. Proposition 1. Consider the case that Q(f) = 12 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f(x)\u22252Hdx, where H is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Then the functional gradient defined by Eq. (4) is equivalent as g(t, x) = argmin f\u2208F 1 2 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225f(x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H dx (7) Remark. Our regularizer is similar to the Bregman divergence in proximal gradient. We can further extend Q(\u00b7) with a convex function h(\u00b7) : R \u2192 [0,\u221e), where the regularizer is defined by Q(f(x)) = Epth(f(x)). We can adapt more complex geometry in our framework with proper h(\u00b7). 2.2 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS: Equilibrium condition. To provide the theoretical guarantees, we show that the stationary distribution of our g(t, x) update is p\u2217. Meanwhile, the evolution of KL-divergence is well-defined (without the explosion of functional gradient) and descending. We list the regularity conditions below. [A1] (Regular function class) The discrepancy induced by function class F is positive-definite: for any q \u0338= p, there exists f \u2208 F such that Eq[\u2207 \u00b7 f(x) + f(x)\u22a4\u2207 ln p(x)] > 0. For f \u2208 F and c \u2208 R, cf \u2208 F , and F is closed. The tail of f is regular: lim\u2225x\u2225\u2192\u221e f(\u03b8, x)p\u2217(x) = 0 for f \u2208 F . [A2] (L-Smoothness) For any x \u2208 Rd, p\u2217(x) > 0 and p(t, x) > 0 are L-smooth densities, i.e., \u2225\u2207 ln p(x)\u2212\u2207 ln p(y)\u2225 \u2264 L\u2225x\u2212 y\u2225, with Ep\u2225x\u22252 <\u221e. Particularly, [A1] is similar to the positive definite kernel in RKHS, which guarantees the decrease of KL divergence. [A2] is designed to make the gradient well-defined: RHS of Eq. (3) is finite. Proposition 2. Under [A1], [A2], when we update Xt as Eq. (7), we have \u2212\u221e < dDKLdt < 0 for all p(t, x) \u0338= p\u2217(x). i.e., g(t, x) = 0 if and only if p(t, x) = p\u2217(x). Proposition 2 shows that the continuous dynamics of our g(t, x) is well-defined and the KL divergence along the dynamics is descending. The only stationary distribution for p(t, x) is p\u2217(x). Convergence rate. The convergence rate of our framework mainly depends on (1) the capacity of function class F ; (2) the complexity of p\u2217. In this section, we analyze that when the approximation error is small and the target p\u2217 is log-Sobolev, the KL divergence converges linearly. [A3] (\u03f5-approximation) For any t > 0, there exists ft(x) \u2208 F and \u03f5 < 1, such that\u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225ft(x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H dx \u2264 \u03f5 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H\u22121 dx [A4] The target p\u2217 satisfies \u00b5-log-Sobolev inequality (\u00b5 > 0): For any differentiable function g, we have Ep\u2217 [ g2 ln g2 ] \u2212 Ep\u2217 [ g2 ] lnEp\u2217 [ g2 ] \u2264 2 \u00b5 Ep\u2217 [ \u2225\u2207g\u22252 ] . Specifically, [A3] is the error control of gradient approximation. With universal approximation theorem (Hornik et al., 1989), any continuous function can be estimated by neural networks, which indicates the existence of such a function class. [A4] is a common assumption in sampling literature. It is more general than strongly concave assumption (Vempala & Wibisono, 2019). Theorem 1. Under [A1]-[A4], for any t > 0, we assume that the largest eigenvalue, \u03bbmax(H) = m. Then we have dDKL(t)dt \u2264 \u2212 1 2Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x)\u2225\u2225\u22252H\u22121 and DKL(t) \u2264 exp(\u2212(1\u2212 \u03f5)\u00b5t/m)DKL(0). Theorem 1 shows that when p\u2217 is log-Sobolev, our algorithm achieves linear convergence rate with a function class powerful enough to approximate the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient. Moreover, considering the discrete algorithm, we have to make sure that the step size is proper, i.e., \u2225H\u22121\u22072 ln p\u2217(x)\u2225 \u2264 c, for some constant c > 0. Thus, the preconditioned H = \u2212c\u22072 ln p\u2217 is better than plain one H = cLI , since (\u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217)\u22121 \u2ab0 L\u22121I . For better understanding, we have provided a Gaussian case discretized proof in Appendix A.6 to illustrate this phenomenon. 3 PFG: PRECONDITIONED FUNCTIONAL GRADIENT FLOW: Algorithm 1 PFG: Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow Input: Unnormalized target distribution p\u2217(x) = e\u2212U(x), f\u03b8(x) : Rd \u2192 Rd, initial particles (parameters) {xi0}ni=1, \u03b80, iteration parameter T, T \u2032, step size \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032, regularization function h(\u00b7). for t = 1, . . . , T do Assign \u03b80t = \u03b8t\u22121; for t\u2032 = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T \u2032 do Compute L\u0302(\u03b8) = 1 n \u2211n i=1 ( h(f\u03b8(x i t)) + f\u03b8(x i t) \u00b7 \u2207U(xit)\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8(xit) ) Update \u03b8t \u2032 t = \u03b8 t\u2032\u22121 t \u2212 \u03b7\u2032\u2207L\u0302(\u03b8t \u2032\u22121 t ); end Assign \u03b8t = \u03b8T1t and update particles x i t = x i t + \u03b7 ( f\u03b8t(x i t) ) for all i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n; end Return: Optimized particles {xiT }ni=1 3.1 ALGORITHM: We will realize our algorithm with parametric f\u03b8 (such as neural networks) and discretize the update. Parametric Function Class. We can let F = {f\u03b8(x) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} and apply g(t, x) = f\u03b8\u0302t(x), such that \u03b8\u0302t = argmin \u03b8\u2208\u0398 [\u222b p(t, x)[\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8(x)\u2212 f\u03b8(x)\u22a4\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) + 1 2 \u2225f\u03b8(x)\u22252H ]dx ] , (8) where H is a symmetric positive definite matrix estimated at time t. Eq. (8) is a direct result from Eq. (4) and (6). The parametric function class allows f\u03b8 to be optimized by iterative algorithms. Choice of H . Considering the posterior mean trajectory, it is equivalent to the conventional optimization, so that \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217 is ideal (Newton\u2019s method) to implement discrete algorithms. We use diagonal Fisher information estimators for efficient computation as Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011). We approximate the preconditioner H for all particles at each time step t by moving averaging. Discrete update. We can present our algorithm by discretizing Eq. (4) and (8). Given X0 \u223c p0, we update Xk as Xk+1 = Xk + \u03b7f\u03b8\u0302k(Xk), where \u03b8\u0302k is obtained by Eq. (8) with (stochastic) gradient descent. The integral over p(k, x) is estimated by particle samples. Full procedure is presented in Alg. 1, where the regularizer h is 12\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 2 H by default. 3.2 COMPARISON WITH SVGD:  3.2.1 SVGD FROM FUNCTIONAL GRADIENT VIEW: For simplicity, we prove the case under finite-dimensional feature map2, \u03c8(x) : Rd \u2192 Rh. We assume that F = {W\u03c8(x) :W \u2208 Rd\u00d7h}, and let kernel k(x, y) = \u03c8(x)\u22a4\u03c8(y), Q(f) = 12\u2225f\u2225 2 Hd = 1 2\u2225W\u2225 2 F , where RKHS norm is the Frobenius norm of W . The solution is defined by W\u0302t = argmin W\u2208Rd\u00d7h \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) trace[W\u2207\u03c8(x) +W\u03c8(x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)\u22a4]dx+ 1 2 \u2225W\u22252F , (9) 2Infinite-dimensional version is provided in Appendix A.7. which gives W\u0302t = \u222b p(t, x\u2032)[\u2207\u03c8(x\u2032)\u22a4 +\u2207 ln p\u2217(x\u2032)\u03c8(x\u2032)\u22a4]dx\u2032. This implies that g(t, x) = W\u0302t\u03c8(x) = \u222b p(t, y)[\u2207yk(y, x) +\u2207 ln p\u2217(y)k(y, x)]dy, (10) which is equivalent to SVGD. For linear function classes, such as RKHS, Q can be directly applied to the parameters, such as W here. The regularization of SVGD is 12\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 2 F (the norm defined in RKHS). For non-linear function classes, such as neural networks, the RKHS norm cannot be defined. 3.2.2 LIMITATIONS OF SVGD: Kernel function class. As in Section 3.2.1, RKHS only contains linear combination of the feature map functions, which suffers from curse of dimensionality (Geenens, 2011). On the other hand, some non-linear function classes, such as neural network, performs well on high dimensional data (LeCun et al., 2015). The extension to non-linear function classes is needed for better performance. Gradient preconditioning in SVGD. In Example 1, when \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217 is ill-conditioned, PFG algorithm follows the shortest path from \u00b50 to \u00b5\u2217. Although SVGD can implement preconditioning matrices as (Wang et al., 2019), due to the curl component and time-dependent Jacobian of d\u00b5t/dt, any symmetric matrix cannot provide optimal preconditioning (detailed derivation in Appendix). Suboptimal convergence rate. For log-Sobolev p\u2217, SVGD with commonly used bounded smoothing kernels (such as RBF kernel) cannot reach the linear convergence rate (Duncan et al., 2019) and the explicit KL convergence rate is unknown yet. Meanwhile, the Wasserstein gradient flow converges linearly. When the function class is sufficiently large, PFG converges provably faster than SVGD. Computational cost. For SVGD, main computation cost comes from the kernel matrix: with n particles, we need O(n2) memory and computation. Our algorithm uses an iterative approximation to optimize g(t, x), whose memory cost is independent of n and computational cost is O(n) (Bertsekas et al., 2011). The repulsive force between particles is achieved by \u2207 \u00b7 f operator on each particle. 4 EXPERIMENT: To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we have conducted experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Without special declarations, we use parametric two-layer neural networks with Sigmoid activation as our function class. To approximate H in real datasets, we use the approximated diagonal Hessian matrix H\u0302 , and choose H = H\u0302\u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2208 {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1}; the inner loop T \u2032 of PFG is chosen from {1, 2, 5, 10}, the hidden layer size is chosen from {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}. The parameters are chosen by validation. More detailed settings are provided in the Appendix. Gaussian Mixture. To demonstrate the capacity of non-linear function class, we have conducted the Gaussian mixture experiments to show the advantage over linear function class, e.g., SVGD (RBF kernel). We consider to sample from a 10-cluster Gaussian Mixture distribution. Both SVGD and our algorithm are trained with 1,000 particles. Fig. 3 shows that the estimated score by RBF kernel is usually unsatisfactory: (1) In lowdensity area, it suffers from gradient vanishing, which makes samples stuck at these parts (similar to Fig. 1 (b)); (2) The score function cannot distinguish connected clusters. Specifically, some clusters are isolated while others might be connected. The choice of bandwidth is hard. The fixed bandwidth makes the SVGD algorithm un- able to determine the gradient near connected clusters. It fails to capture the clusters near (\u22120.75, 0.5). However, the non-linear function class is able to resolve the above difficulties. In PFG, we found that the score function is well-estimated and the resulting samples mimic the true density properly. Ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution. We show the effectiveness of our proposed regularizer. For ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution, the condition number of \u03a3\u2217 is large, i.e., the ratio between maximal and minimal eigenvalue is large. We follow Example 1 and compare different \u00b5\u2217 and \u03a3\u2217. When \u03a3\u2217 is well-conditioned (\u03a3\u2217 = I), L2 regularizer (equivalent to Wasserstein gradient) performs well. However, it will be slowed down significantly with ill-conditioned \u03a3\u2217. For SVGD with linear kernel, the convergence slows down with shifted \u00b5\u2217 or ill-conditioned \u03a3\u2217. For SVGD with RBF kernel, the convergence is slow due to the misspecified function class. Interestingly, for ill-conditioned case, \u00b5t of SVGD (linear) converges faster than our method with H = I but KL divergence does not always follow the trend. The reason is that \u03a3t of SVGD is highly biased, making KL divergence large. Our algorithm provides feasible Wasserstein gradient estimators and makes the particle-based sampling algorithm compatible with ill-conditioned sampling case. Logistic Regression. We conduct Bayesian logistic regression for binary classification task on Sonar and Australian dataset (Dua & Graff, 2017). In particular, the prior of weight samples are assigned N (0, 1); the step-size is fixed as 0.01. We compared our algorithm with SVGD (200 particles), full batch gradient is used in this part. To measure the quality of posterior approximation, we use 3 metrics: (1) the distance between sample mean \u00b5t and posterior mean \u00b5\u2217; (2) the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance (Gretton et al., 2012) from particle samples to posterior samples; (3) the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of current particles, Ex\u223cpt [log p\u2217(x)\u2212 log p(t, x)], where p\u2217(x) is the unnormalized density p(x,D) with training data D, the entropy term log p(t, x) is estimated by kernel density. The ground truth samples of p\u2217 is estimated by NUTS (Hoffman et al., 2014). Fig. 5 shows that our method outperforms SVGD consistently. Hierarchical Logistic Regression. For hierarchical logistic regression, we consider a 2- level hierarchical regression, where prior of weight samples is N (0, \u03b1\u22121). The prior of \u03b1 is Gamma(0, 0.01). All step-sizes are chosen from {10\u2212t : t = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } by validation. We compare the test accuracy and negative log-likelihood as Liu & Wang (2016). Mini-batch was used to estimate the log-likelihood of training samples (batch size is 200). Tab. 1 shows that our algorithm performs the best against SVGD and SGLD on hierarchical logistic regression. Bayesian Neural Networks. We compare our algorithm with SGLD and SVGD variants on Bayesian neural networks. We conduct the two-layer network with 50 hidden units (100 for Year dataset, 128 for MNIST) and ReLU activation function; the batch-size is 100 (1000 for Year dataset), All stepsizes are chosen from {10\u2212t : t = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } by validation. For UCI datasets, we choose the preconditioned version for comparison: M-SVGD (Wang et al., 2019) and pSGLD (Li et al., 2016). Data samples are randomly partitioned to two parts: 90% (training), 10% (testing) and 100 particles is used. For MNIST, data split follows the default setting and we compare our algorithm with SVGD for 5, 10, 50, 100 particles (SVGD with 100 particles exceeded the memory limit). In Tab. 2, PFG outperforms SVGD and SGLD significantly. In Fig. 6, we found that the accuracy and NLL of PFG is better than SVGD with all particle size. With more particle samples, PFG algorithm also improves. Time Comparison. As indicated, our algorithm is more scalable than SVGD in terms of particle numbers. Tab. 3 shows that SVGD entails more computation cost with the increase of particle numbers. Our functional gradient is obtained with iterative approximation without kernel matrix computation. When n is large, our O(n) algorithm is much faster than O(n2) kernel-based method. Interestingly, the introduction of particle interactions is a key merit of particle-based VI algorithms, which intuitively needs O(n2) computation. The integration by parts technique draws the connection between the particle interaction and \u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8 which supports more efficient computational realizations. 5 RELATED WORKS: Stein Discrepancy and SVGD. Stein discrepancy (Liu et al., 2016; Chwialkowski et al., 2016; Liu & Wang, 2016) is known as the foundation of the SVGD algorithm, which is defined on the bounded function classes, such as functions with bounded RKHS norm. We provide another view to derive SVGD: SVGD is a functional gradient method with RKHS norm regularizer. From this view, we found that there are other variants of particle-based VI. We suggest that the our proposed framework has many advantages over SVGD as the function class is more general and the kernel computation can be saved. We use neural networks as our F in real practice, which is much more efficient than SVGD. Moreover, the general regularizer in Eq. (6) improves the conditioning of functional gradient, which is proven better than SVGD in both theory and experiments. The preconditioning of our algorithm is more explainable than SVGD, without incorporating RKHS-dependent properties. Learning Discrepancy with Neural Networks. Some recent works (Hu et al., 2018; Grathwohl et al., 2020) leverage neural networks to learn the Stein discrepancy, which are related to our PFG algorithm. Grathwohl et al. (2020) implement Q(f(x)) = Ept\u2225f(x)\u22252 (L2 norm) in our framework to measure the similarity between two distributions and use the metric to train energy-based models (EBM) without likelihood. The proposed EBM training strategy is efficient and accurate thanks to the capacity of neural networks. However, they did not further validate the sampling performance of their \u201clearned discrepancy\u201d, so it is a new version of KSD (Liu et al., 2016), rather than SVGD. Hu et al. (2018) is also based on L2 norm regularization to train a neural \u201cgenerator\u201d for sampling tasks. They discussed the scaling of L2 regularization to align with the step size. In contrast, we restrict our investigation in particle-based VI and avoid learning a \u201cgenerator\u201d, which may introduce more parameterization errors. Moreover, we extend the design of Q to a general case, and emphasize the benefits of our proposed regularizers corresponding to the preconditioned algorithm. We include the Example 1 and Fig. 4 to demonstrate the necessity of preconditioning. Our theoretical results have demonstrated the improvement of PFG algorithm against SVGD. KL Wasserstein Gradient Flow. Wasserstein gradient flow (Ambrosio et al., 2005) is the continuous dynamics to minimize functionals in Wasserstein space, which is crucial in sampling and optimal transport tasks. However, the numerical computation of Wasserstein gradient is non-trivial. Previous works (Peyre\u0301, 2015; Benamou et al., 2016; Carlier et al., 2017) attempt to find tractable formulation with spatial discretization, which suffers from curse of dimensionality. More recently, (Mokrov et al., 2021; Alvarez-Melis et al., 2021) leverage neural networks to model the Wasserstein gradient and aim to find the full transport path between p0 and p\u2217. The computation of full path is extremely large. Salim et al. (2020) defines proximal gradient in Wasserstein space by JKO operator. However, the work mainly focus on theoretical properties and the efficient implementation remains open. When the functional is KL divergence, Wasserstein gradient can also be realized with Langevin dynamics (Welling & Teh, 2011; Bernton, 2018) by adding Gaussian noise to particles, which are also variants of MCMC. However, the deterministic algorithm to approximate Wasserstein gradient flow is still challenging. Our framework provides a tractable approximation to fix this gap. 6 CONCLUSION: In particle-based VI, we consider that the particles can be updated with a preconditioned functional gradient flow. Our theoretical results and Gaussian example led to an algorithm: PFG that can approximate preconditioned Wasserstein gradient directly. Our theory indicates that when the function class is large, PFG is provably faster than conventional particle-based VI, SVGD. The empirical result showed that PFG performs better than conventional SVGD and SGLD variants. A PROOFS:  A.1 PROOF OF EQ. (3): From the continuity equation (or Fokker-Planck equation), we have \u2202p(t, x) \u2202t = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 [g(t, x)p(t, x)] By chain rule and integration by parts, dDKL(t) dt = \u222b \u2202p(t, x) \u2202t ( 1 + ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) ) dx =\u2212 \u222b \u2207 \u00b7 [g(t, x)p(t, x)] ( 1 + ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) ) dx = \u222b [g(t, x)p(t, x)]\u22a4\u2207 ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) dx = \u222b [g(t, x)p(t, x)]\u22a4\u2207[ln p(t, x)\u2212 ln p\u2217(x)]dx = \u222b g(t, x)\u22a4[\u2207p(t, x)\u2212 p(t, x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)]dx =\u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 g(t, x) + g(t, x)\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx. A.2 DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLE 1: (1) SVGD with linear kernel k(x, y) = x\u22a4Ky + 1 g(t, x) = \u2212\u03a3\u22121\u2217 [(\u03a3t + (\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217)\u00b5\u22a4t )Kx+ \u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217] +Kx. (11) (2) SVGD with RBF kernel k\u03c3(x, y) = 1\u221a\u03c32 exp ( \u2212 12\u03c32 \u2225y \u2212 x\u2225 2 ) g(t, x) = O(x exp(\u2212\u2225x\u22252)). (12) (3) Linear function class with L2 regularization Q(f(x)) = 12Ept\u2225f(x)\u2225 2. g(t, x) = \u2212\u03a3\u22121\u2217 (x\u2212 \u00b5\u2217) + \u03a3\u22121t (x\u2212 \u00b5t). (13) (4) Linear function class with Mahalanobis regularization Q(f(x)) = 12Ept\u2225f(x)\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 g(t, x) = \u2212(x\u2212 \u00b5\u2217) + \u03a3\u2217\u03a3\u22121t (x\u2212 \u00b5t). (14) For optimal transport g(t, x) = \u2212(x\u2212 \u00b5\u2217) + \u03a3\u22121/2t (\u03a3 1/2 t \u03a3\u2217\u03a3 1/2 t ) 1/2\u03a3 \u22121/2 t (x\u2212 \u00b5t). Note that \u00b5\u2217\u00b5\u22a4t is not symmetric, which makes the distribution rotate. Figure 7 shows that we can split the curl component by Helmholtz decomposition, which means that this part would rotate the distribution and cannot be compromised by preconditioning method. Thus, we cannot find any K to obtain a proper preconditioning. Proof. We consider these 4 cases seperately. (1) SVGD with linear kernel.

(A Variant of Lemma. 11 in (Vempala & Wibisono, 2019)) Suppose that p(x) > 0 is L-smooth. Then, we have \u222b p(x) \u2225\u2207 ln p(x)\u22252 dx \u2264 Ld; Proof. By [A1], there exists f such that \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 f + f\u22a4\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx < 0. (19) Thus, consider fc(x) = cf(x), L(c) = \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 cf + cf\u22a4\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx =: \u2212Cfc (20) l(c) = \u222b p(t, x)\u2225cf\u22252Hdx =: c2 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f\u22252Hdx = CHc2 (21) where CH , Cf > 0. When c = Cf2CH , we have CHc 2 \u2212 Cfc = \u2212 C2f 4CH < 0.

Moreover, the choice of preconditioning matrix affect the convergence rate with the largest eigenvalue. In real practice, due to the discretized algorithm, one needs to normalize the scaling of H , which is equivalent to the learning rate in practice. For any preconditioning H\u0303 , we need to compute the corresponding learning rate to get H = \u03b7\u22121H\u0303 . One usually set that \u2225\u03b7H\u0303\u22121\u22072 ln p\u2217(x)\u2225\u221212 \u2264 1 to make the discretized (first-order) algorithm feasible (\u03b7 \u2264 \u2225H\u0303\u22121\u22072 ln p\u2217(x)\u22252), otherwise the second order error would be too large. The construction is similar to condition number dependency in optimization literature. Take the fixed largest learning rate for example in the continuous case: When H\u0303 = I , we have that \u03b7 = 1/L, H = LI , dDKL(t) dt \u2264 \u2212 1 2L Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 . When H\u0303 = \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217, we have that \u03b7 = 1, H = \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217, dDKL(t) dt \u2264 \u22121 2 Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 \u2212(\u22072 ln p\u2217)\u22121 \u2264 \u2212 1 2L Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 . A.6 ANALYSIS OF DISCRETE GAUSSIAN CASE: As is shown in Example 1, given that x0 \u223c N (0, I) and the target distribution is N (\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217), we have the following update for our PFG algorithm, xt+1 = xt + \u03b7H \u22121 (\u03a3\u22121\u2217 (\u00b5\u2217 \u2212 xt) + \u03a3\u22121t (xt \u2212 \u00b5t)) . By taking the expectation, we have \u00b5t+1 \u2212 \u00b5t = \u03b7H\u22121 ( \u03a3\u22121\u2217 (\u00b5\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5t) ) \u03a3t+1 \u2212 \u03a3t = \u03b7H\u22121 ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) \u03a3t + \u03b7\u03a3t ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) H\u22121 + \u03b72H\u22121 ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) \u03a3t ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) H\u22121 Since \u03a30 = I , the eigenvectors of \u03a3t will not change during the update. For notation simplicity, we write the diagonal case in the following discussion. Assume that \u03a3\u2217 = diag(\u03c321 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c32d), \u03a3t = diag(s21(t), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s2d(t)), H = diag(h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hd), such that \u03c3i \u2265 \u03c3i+1 for any i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d \u2212 1. Without loss of generality, we assume that \u03c31 \u2264 1, otherwise we can still rescale the initialization to obtain the similar constraint. Given the fact that x\u2212 ln(1 + x) \u2264 x 2 2 when x > 0, we have, DKL(t) \u2264 1 2 ( \u2225\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 + 1 2 d\u2211 i=1 ( s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i )2) . Thus, we define C0 := 1 2 ( \u2225\u00b50 \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 + 1 2 d\u2211 i=1 ( 1\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i )2) . (33) Considering the i-th dimension (with notation [\u00b7]i), [\u00b5t+1]i = ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i ) [\u00b5t]i + \u03b7 hi\u03c32i [\u00b5\u2217]i (34) s2i (t+ 1) = s 2 i (t) + 2\u03b7s2i (t) hi ( 1 si(t)2 \u2212 1 \u03c32i ) + \u03b72s2i (t) h2i ( 1 si(t)2 \u2212 1 \u03c32i )2 . (35) To guarantee the convergence of the algorithm, we need to make sure that both \u00b5t and \u03a3t converge. By rearranging (34) and (35), we have [\u00b5t+1]i \u2212 [\u00b5\u2217]i \u03c3i = ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i ) [\u00b5t]i \u2212 [\u00b5\u2217]i \u03c3i s2i (t+ 1)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i = ( 1\u2212 2\u03b7 hi\u03c32i )( s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i ) + \u03b72 h2i\u03c3 2 i s 2 i (t) ( s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i )2 . One needs to construct contraction sequences of both mean and variance gap, which are guided by 1\u2212 \u03b7/(hi\u03c32i ) and 1\u2212 2\u03b7/(hi\u03c32i ). Notice that s2i (0) \u2265 \u03c32i . Assume that \u03b7 \u2264 mini hi\u03c32i /2. Then we have s2i (t+ 1) \u2265 \u03c32i . Thus, we obtain \u03b7 hi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u03c32i \u2212 1s2i (t) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1. It is natural to obtain the contraction of both mean and variance gap, \u2225\u00b5t+1 \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 \u2264 maxi ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i )2 \u2225\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223s2i (t+ 1)\u2212 \u03c32i\u03c32i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b7hi\u03c32i ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i\u03c32i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 DKL(t) \u2264 max i ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i )2t C0, where C0 is defined in Eq. (33). When hi = 1, we have \u03b7 = \u03c32d 2 DKL(t) \u2264 ( 1\u2212 \u03c3 2 d 2\u03c321 )2t C0. When hi = \u03c3\u22122i , we have \u03b7 = 1 2 DKL(t) \u2264 1 4t C0. This result is equivalent to the Remark in A.5. A.7 PROOF OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CASE OF RKHS: Proof. Assume the feature map, \u03c8(x) : Rd \u2192 H and let kernel k(x, y) = \u27e8\u03c8(x), \u03c8(y)\u27e9H , Q(f) = 1 2\u2225f\u2225Hd . One can perform spectral decomposition to obtain that k(x, y) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u03bbi\u03c8i(x)\u03c8i(y) where \u03c8i : Rd \u2192 R are orthonormal basis and \u03bbi is the corresponding eigenvalue. For any g \u2208 Hd, we have the decomposition, g(x) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 gi \u221a \u03bbi\u03c8i(x), where gi \u2208 Rd and \u2211\u221e i=1 \u2225gi\u22252 <\u221e. The solution is defined by g\u0302 = argmin g\u2208Hd \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) ( \u2207 \u00b7 g +\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)\u22a4g(x) ) + 1 2 \u2225g\u22252Hd , (36) = argmin g\u2208Hd \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) ( \u2207 \u00b7 \u221e\u2211 i=1 gi \u221a \u03bbi\u03c8i(x) + \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u221a \u03bbi\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)\u22a4gi\u03c8i(x) ) + \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u2225gi\u22252, (37) which gives g\u0302i = \u221a \u03bbi \u222b p(t, y)[\u2207\u03c8i(y) +\u2207 ln p\u2217(y)\u03c8i(y)]dy. This implies that g(t, x) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u221a \u03bbig\u0302i\u03c8i(x) = \u222b p(t, y)[\u2207yk(y, x) +\u2207 ln p\u2217(y)k(y, x)]dy, (38) which is equivalent to SVGD. B MORE DISCUSSIONS:  B.1 SCORE MATCHING: Score matching (SM) is related to our algorithm due to the integration by parts technique, which uses parameterized models to estimate Stein score \u2207 ln p\u2217. We made some modifications to the original techniques in SM: (1) We extend the score matching \u2207 ln p\u2217 to Wasserstein gradient approximation \u2207 ln p\u2217 \u2212\u2207 ln pt; (2) We introduce the geometry-aware regularization to approximate the preconditioned gradient. Thus, our proposed modifications make it suitable for sampling tasks. In a word, both SM and PFG are derived from the integration by parts technique. SM is a very promising framework in generative modeling and our PFG is more suitable for sampling tasks. B.2 OTHER PRECONDITIONED PARTICLE-BASED ALGORITHMS: Stein variational Newton method (SVN) (Detommaso et al., 2018) approximates the Hessian to accelerate SVGD. However, due to the gap between SVGD and Wasserstein gradient flow, the theoretical interpretation is not clear. Matrix SVGD (Wang et al., 2019) leverages more general matrix-valued kernels in SVGD, which includes SVN as a variant and is better than SVN. (Chen et al., 2019) perform a parallel update of the parameter samples projected into a low-dimensional subspace by an SVN method. It implements dimension reduction to SVN algorithm. Liu et al. (2022) projects SVGD onto arbitrary dimensional subspaces with Grassmann Stein kernel discrepancy, which implement Riemannian optimization technique to find the proper projection space. Note that all of these algorithms are based on RKHS norm regularization. As we mentioned in Example 1, due to the introduction of RKHS, the preconditioning matrix is often hard to find. For example, the preconditioning matrix of the linear kernel varies in time, while our algorithm only needs a constant matrix. For RBF kernel, the previous works have demonstrated the improvement of the Hessian inverse matrix, but the design is still heuristic due to the gap between the Wasserstein gradient and SVGD. Our algorithm directly approximates the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient, and further analysis is clear and conclusive. Also, the SVGD-based algorithms suffer from the drawbacks of RKHS norm regularization, as discussed in Example 1. B.3 COMPARISON WITH JKO-BASED WASSERSTEIN GRADIENT FLOW: There is another line of work to approximate Wasserstein gradient flow through JKO-discretization (Mokrov et al., 2021; Alvarez-Melis et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2021). The continuous versions of these Wasserstein gradient flow algorithms are related to our algorithm when the functional is chosen as KL divergence. These are promising alternative algorithms to PFG in transport tasks. From the theoretical view, they solves the JKO operator with special neural networks (ICNN) and aims to estimate the Wasserstein gradient of general functionals, including KL/JS divergence, etc. On the other hand, our algorithm is motivated by the continuous case of KL Wasserstein gradient flow and we only consider the Euler discretization (rather than JKO), which is the setting of particle-based variational inference. When we consider the KL divergence and posterior sampling task, our proposed method is more efficient than Wasserstein gradient flow based ones, due to the flexibility of the gradient estimation function. We provide the empirical results on Bayesian logistic regression below (Covtype dataset). According to the table, our algorithm outperforms JKO-type Wasserstein gradient methods. Moreover, it is important to mention that JKO-type Wasserstein gradient is extremely computation-exhausted, due to the computation of JKO operator. Thus, it would be more challenging to apply them to larger tasks such as Bayesian neural networks. B.4 VARIANCE COLLAPSE AND HIGH-DIMENSIONAL PERFORMANCE Some recent works (Ba et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2020; Zhuo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022) suggest that SVGD suffers from curse of dimensionality and the variance of SVGD-trained particles tend to diminish in high-dimensional spaces. We highlight that one the key issues is the capacity of RBF function space is misspecified. As shown in Tab. 5, when fitting a Gaussian distribution, an ideal function class is the linear function class given the Gaussian initialization. However, provided with RBF-based SVGD, the variance collapse phenomenon is extremely severe. On the contrary, when using a proper function class (linear), both SVGD and PFG performs well. More importantly, for some powerful non-linear function classes (neural networks), although it is not well-specified one, it still performs well due to the approximation capacity. This indicates that when the target distribution is more complex (the well-specified function class is not simply obtained), the effectiveness of neural network function class would be particularly important. To further justify the effectiveness of PFG algorithm in high dimensional cases, we evaluate our model under different settings following Liu et al. (2022). Tab. 6 shows that our PFG algorithm is robust to high dimensional fitting problems, which is comparable to GSVGD (Liu et al., 2022) in Gaussian case. We also include a further justification in Tab. 7, which compute the energy distance between particle the target distribution and the particle estimation on a 4-mode Gaussian mixture distribution. In this case, the function class of gradient should be much larger than linear case. We can find that the resulting performance improves the previous work (GSVGD). B.5 ESTIMATION OF PRECONDITIONING MATRIX: Ideally, one would leverage the exact Hessian inverse as the preconditioning matrix to make the algorithm well-conditioned, which is also the target of other preconditioned SVGD algorithms. However, the computation of exact Hessian is challenging. Thus, motivated by adaptive gradient optimization algorithms, we leverage the moving average of Fisher information to obtain the preconditioning matrix. We conduct hierarchical logistic regression to discuss the importance of preconditioning. We compare 3 kinds of preconditioning strategies to estimate: (1) Full Hessian: compute the exact full Hessian matrix; (2) K-FAC: Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature to estimate Hessian; (3) Diagonal: Diagonal moving average to estimate Hessian. According to the table, we can find that the preconditioning indeed improves the performance of Bayesian inference, and the choice of estimation strategies does not differ much. Thus, we choose the most efficient one: diagonal estimation. B.6 MORE COMPARSIONS: We also include a more complete empirical results on Bayesian neural networks, including the comparison with plain version of SVGD (Liu & Wang, 2016), SGLD (Welling & Teh, 2011), and Sliced SVGD (S-SVGD) (Gong et al., 2020). Our algorithm is still the most competitive one according to the table. C IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS All experiments are conducted on Python 3.7 with NVIDIA 2080 Ti. Particularly, we use PyTorch 1.9 to build models. Besides, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pillow are used in the models. C.1 SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENTS: C.1.1 ILL-CONDITIONED GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION For ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution, we reproduce the continuous dynamics with Euler discretization. We consider 4 cases: (a) \u00b5\u2217 = [1, 1]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(1, 1); (b) \u00b5\u2217 = [1, 1]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(100, 1); (c) \u00b5\u2217 = [20, 20]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(1, 1); (d) \u00b5\u2217 = [20, 20]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(100, 1) to illustrate the behavior of SVGD and our algorithm clearly. Notably, for our algorithms and SVGD (linear kernel), we use step size 10\u22123 to approximate the continuous dynamics and solve the mean and variance exactly (equivalent to infinite particles); for SVGD with RBF kernel, we use step size 10\u22122 with 1, 000 particles to approximate mean and variance. For the neural network function class, we assume that the function class of two-layer neural network F\u03b8 = {f\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398}. In practice, we may incorporate base shift f0 as gradient boosting to accelerate the convergence, we use F = {f0 + f\u03b8 : f\u03b8 \u2208 F\u03b8}, where f0(x) = 0 or f0(x) = c\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) with some constant c. In practice, we select c from {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1} by validation. Empirically, high dimensional models (such as Bayesian neural networks) can be accelerated significantly with the base function. C.1.2 GAUSSIAN MIXTURE: For Gaussian Mixture, we sample a 2-d 10-cluster Gaussian Mixture, where cluster means are sampled from standard Normal distribution, covariance matrix is 0.12I , the marginal probability of each cluster is 1/10. The function class is 2-layer network with 32 hidden neurons and Tanh activation function. For inner loop, we choose T \u2032 = 5 and SGD optimizer (lr = 1e-3) with momentum 0.9. For particle optimization, we choose step-size = 1e-1. For SVGD, we choose RBF kernel with median bandwidth, step-size is 1e-2. C.2 APPROXIMATE POSTERIOR INFERENCE: To compute the trace, we use the randomized trace estimation (Hutchinson\u2019s trace estimator) (Hutchinson, 1989) to accelerate the computation . \u2022 Sample {\u03bei}Ki=1, such that E\u03be = 0 and Cov\u03be = I; \u2022 Compute L\u0302(\u03b8) = 1 m \u2211m i=1 ( Q(f\u03b8(x i t) + f0(x i t))\u2212 f\u03b8(xit) \u00b7 \u2207U(xit)\u2212 1K \u2211K j=1 \u03be \u22a4 i \u2207f\u03b8(xit)\u03bei ) ; \u2022 Compute L\u0302(\u03b8) = 1 m \u2211m i=1 ( Q(f\u03b8(x i t) + f0(x i t))\u2212 f\u03b8(xit) \u00b7 \u2207U(xit)\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8(xit) ) ; \u2022 Update \u03b8t \u2032 t = \u03b8 t\u2032\u22121 t \u2212 \u03b7\u2032\u2207L\u0302(\u03b8t \u2032\u22121 t ); where \u03be is chosen as Rademacher distribution. C.2.1 LOGISTIC REGRESSION: For logistic regression, we compare our algorithm with SVGD in terms of the \u201cgoodness\u201d of particle distribution. The ground truth is computed by NUTS (Hoffman et al., 2014). The mean is computed by 40,000 samples, the MMD is computed with 4,000 samples. The H in this part is chosen as H = I or H = H\u03020.1. In the experiments, we select step-size from {10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124} for each algorithm by validation. And we use Adam optimizer without momentum. For SVGD, we choose RBF kernel with median bandwidth. For PFG, we select inner loop from {1, 2, 5, 10} by validation. The hidden neuron is 32. C.2.2 HIERARCHICAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION: For hierarchical logistic regression, we use the test performance to measure the different algorithms, including likelihood and accuracy. The H in this part is chosen as H = H\u03020.5. For all experiments, batch-size is 200 and we select step-size from {10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124} for each algorithm by validation. And we use Adam optimizer without momentum. For SVGD, we choose RBF kernel with median bandwidth. For PFG, we select inner loop from {1, 2, 5, 10} by validation. The hidden neuron is 32. C.2.3 BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORKS (BNN): We have two experiments in this part: UCI datasets, MNIST classification. The metric includes MSE/accuracy and likelihood. The hidden layer size is chosen from {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}. To approximate H , we use the approximated diagonal Hessian matrix H\u0302 , and choose H = H\u0302\u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2208 {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1}. The inner loop T \u2032 of PFG is chosen from {1, 2, 5, 10} and with SGD optimizer (lr = 1e-3, momentum=0.9). For UCI datasets, we follow the setting of SVGD (Liu & Wang, 2016). Data samples are randomly partitioned to two parts: 90% (training), 10% (testing) and we use 100 particles for inference. We conduct the two-layer BNN with 50 hidden units (100 for Year dataset) with ReLU activation function. The batch-size is 100 (1000 for Year dataset). Step-size is 0.01. For MNIST, we conduct the two-layer BNN with 128 neurons. We compared the experiments with different particle size. Step-sizes are chosen from {10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124}.

The paper title is: Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Sampling from unnormalized density is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, especially for posterior sampling. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Welling & Teh, 2011; Hoffman et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014) and Variational inference (VI) (Ranganath et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al., 2017) are two mainstream solutions: MCMC is asymptotically unbiased but sample-exhausted; VI is computationally efficient but usually biased. Recently, particle-based VI algorithms (Liu & Wang, 2016; Detommaso et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) tend to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between particle samples and the posterior, and absorb the advantages of both MCMC and VI: (1) non-parametric flexibility and asymptotic unbiasedness; (2) sample efficiency with the interaction between particles; (3) deterministic updates. Thus, these algorithms are competitive in sampling tasks, such as Bayesian inference (Liu & Wang, 2016; Feng et al., 2017; Detommaso et al., 2018), probabilistic models (Wang & Liu, 2016; Pu et al., 2017). Given a target distribution p\u2217(x), particle-based VI aims to find g(t, x), so that starting with X0 \u223c p0, the distribution p(t, x) of the following method: dXt = g(t,Xt)dt, converges to p\u2217(x) as t \u2192 \u221e. By continuity equation (Jordan et al., 1998), we can capture the evolution of p(t, x) by \u2202p(t, x) \u2202t = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (p(t, x)g(t, x)) . (1) In order to measure the \u201ccloseness\u201d between p(t, \u00b7) and p\u2217, we typically adopt the KL divergence, DKL(t) = \u222b p(t, x) ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) dx. (2) Using chain rule and integration by parts, we have dDKL(t) dt = \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 g(t, x) + g(t, x)\u22a4\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx, (3) which captures the evolution of KL divergence. To minimize the KL divergence, one needs to define a \u201cgradient\u201d to update the particles as our g(t, x). The most standard approach, Wasserstein gradient (Ambrosio et al., 2005), defines a gradient for p(t, x) in the Wasserstein space, which contains probability measures with bounded second moments. In particular, for any functional L that maps probability density p(t, x) to a non-negative scalar, we say that the particle density p(t, x) follows the Wasserstein gradient flow of L if g(t, x) is the gradient field of L2(Rd)-functional derivative of L (Villani, 2009). For KL divergence, the solution is \u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t,x) . However, the computation of deterministic and time-inhomogeneous Wasserstein gradient is non-trivial. It is necessary to restrict the function class of g(t, x) to obtain a tractable form. Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is the most popular particle-based algorithm, which provides a tractable form to update particles with the kernelized gradient flow (Chewi et al., 2020; Liu, 2017). It updates particles by minimizing the KL divergence with a functional gradient measured in RKHS. By restricting the functional gradient with bounded RKHS norm, it has an explicit formulation: g(t, x) can be obtained by minimizing Eq. (3). Nonetheless, there are still some limitations due to the restriction of RKHS: (1) the expressive power is limited because kernel method is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality (Geenens, 2011); (2) with n particles, the O(n2) computational overhead of kernel matrix is required. Further, we identify another crucial limitation of SVGD: the kernel design is highly non-trivial. Even in the simple Gaussian case, where particles start with N (0, I) and p\u2217 = N (\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217), commonly used kernels such as linear and RBF kernel, have fundamental drawbacks in SVGD algorithm (Example 1). Our motivation originates from functional gradient boosting (Friedman, 2001; Nitanda & Suzuki, 2018; Johnson & Zhang, 2019). For each p(t, x), we find a proper function as g(t, x) in the function class F to minimize Eq. (3). In this context, we design a regularizer for the functional gradient to approximate variants of \u201cgradient\u201d explicitly. We propose a regularization family to penalize the particle distribution\u2019s functional gradient output. For well-conditioned \u2212\u22072 ln p\u22171, we can approximate the Wasserstein gradient directly; For ill-conditioned \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217, we can adapt our regularizer to approximate a preconditioned one. Thus, our functional gradient is an approximation to the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient. Regarding the function space, we do not restrict the function in RKHS. Instead, we can use non-linear function classes such as neural networks to obtain a better approximation capacity. The flexibility of the function space can lead to a better sampling algorithm, which is supported by our empirical results. Contributions. We propose a particle-based VI framework with regularized functional gradient flow. Specifically, we choose a special family of regularizers to approximate preconditioned Wasserstein gradient flow, which is more effective than SVGD: The non-linear function classes (such as neural networks) have better expressive capacity than RKHS; The functional gradient in our framework explicitly approximates the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient, which supports ill-conditioned cases and obtains provable convergence rate; Our proposed algorithm does not need the O(n2) kernel matrix, leading to computational efficiency when particle size is large. Both theoretical and empirical results show the effectiveness of our framework. 2 ANALYSIS: Notations. In this paper, we use x to denote particle samples in Rd. The distributions are assumed to be absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. The probability density function of the posterior is denoted by p\u2217. p(t, x) (or pt) refers to particle distribution at time t. For scalar function p(t, x), \u2207xp(t, x) denotes its gradient w.r.t. x. For vector function g(t, x), \u2207xg(t, x), \u2207x \u00b7 g(t, x), \u22072xg(t, x) denote its Jacobian matrix, divergence, Hessian w.r.t. x. \u2202p(t,x) \u2202t and \u2202g(t,x) \u2202t denotes the partial derivative w.r.t. t. Without ambiguity, \u2207 stands for \u2207x for conciseness. Notation \u2225x\u22252H stands for x\u22a4Hx and \u2225x\u2225I is denoted by \u2225x\u2225. Notation \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225Hd denotes the RKHS norm on Rd. We let g(t, x) belong to a vector-valued function class F , and find the best functional gradient direction. Inspired by the gradient boosting algorithm for regression and classification problems, we approximate the gradient flow by a function g(t, x) \u2208 F with a regularization term, which solves the 1For any matrix, condition number is the ratio of the maximal to the minimal eigenvalues. A low condition number is well-conditioned, while a high condition number is ill-conditioned. following minimization formulation: g(t, x) = argmin f\u2208F [ \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 f(x) + f(x)\u22a4\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)]dx+Q(f) ] , (4) where Q(\u00b7) is a regularization term that limit the output magnitude of f . This regularization term also implicitly determines the underlying \u201cdistance metric\u201d used to define the gradient estimates g(t, x) in our framework. When Q(x) = 12 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f(x)\u22252dx, Eq. (4) is equivalent to g(t, x) = argmin f\u2208F \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225f(x)\u2212\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)pt(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 dx. (5) If F is well-specified, i.e., \u2207 ln p\u2217(x)pt(x) \u2208 F , we have g(t, x) = \u2207 ln p\u2217(x) pt(x) , which is the direction of Wasserstein gradient flow. Interestingly, despite the computational intractability of Wasserstein gradient, Eq. (4) provides a tractable variational approximation. For RKHS, we will show that SVGD is a special case of Eq. (4), where Q(f) = 12\u2225f\u2225 2 Hd (Sec. 3.2.1). We point out that RKHS norm cannot regularize the functional gradient properly since it is fixed for any p(t, x). Our next example shows that SVGD is a suboptimal solution for Gaussian case. Example 1. Consider that p(t, \u00b7) is N (\u00b5t,\u03a3t), p\u2217 is N (\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217). We consider the SVGD algorithm with linear kernel, RBF kernel, and regularized functional gradient formulation with Q(f) = 1 2Ept\u2225f\u2225 2, and Q(f) = 12Ept\u2225f\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 . Starting with N (0, I), Fig. 1 plots the g(0, x) with different Q and the optimal transport direction; the path of \u00b5t and p(5, x) are illustrated in Fig. 2. The detailed mathematical derivation are provided in the Appendix. Example 1 shows the comparison of different regularizations for the functional gradient. For RKHS norm, we consider the most commonly used kernels: linear and RBF. Fig. 1 shows the g(0, x) of different regularizers: it is clear that only Q(f) = 12Ept\u2225f\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 approximates the optimal transport direction, while other g(0, x) deviates significantly. SVGD with linear kernel underestimates the gradient of large-variance directions; SVGD with RBF kernel even suffers from gradient vanishing in low-density area. Fig. 2 demonstrates the path of \u00b5t with different regularizers. For linear kernel, due to the curl component (\u00b5\u2217\u00b5\u22a4t term in linear SVGD is non-symmetric; See Appendix for details), p(5, x) is rotated with an angle. For RBF kernel, it is misspecified (linear functions are not in F), leading to slow convergence. The L2 regularizer is suboptimal due to the ill-conditioned \u03a3\u2217. We can see that Q(f) = 12Ept\u2225f\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 produces the optimal path for \u00b5t (the line between \u00b50 and \u00b5\u2217). 2.1 GENERAL REGULARIZATION: Inspired by the Gaussian case, we consider the general form Q(f(x)) = 1 2 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f(x)\u22252Hdx (6) where H is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Proposition 1 shows that with Eq. (6), the resulting functional gradient is the approximation of preconditioned Wasserstein gradient flow. It also implies the well-definedness and existence of g(t, x) when F is closed, since \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225H is lower bounded by 0. Proposition 1. Consider the case that Q(f) = 12 \u222b p(t, x)\u2225f(x)\u22252Hdx, where H is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Then the functional gradient defined by Eq. (4) is equivalent as g(t, x) = argmin f\u2208F 1 2 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225f(x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H dx (7) Remark. Our regularizer is similar to the Bregman divergence in proximal gradient. We can further extend Q(\u00b7) with a convex function h(\u00b7) : R \u2192 [0,\u221e), where the regularizer is defined by Q(f(x)) = Epth(f(x)). We can adapt more complex geometry in our framework with proper h(\u00b7). 2.2 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS: Equilibrium condition. To provide the theoretical guarantees, we show that the stationary distribution of our g(t, x) update is p\u2217. Meanwhile, the evolution of KL-divergence is well-defined (without the explosion of functional gradient) and descending. We list the regularity conditions below. [A1] (Regular function class) The discrepancy induced by function class F is positive-definite: for any q \u0338= p, there exists f \u2208 F such that Eq[\u2207 \u00b7 f(x) + f(x)\u22a4\u2207 ln p(x)] > 0. For f \u2208 F and c \u2208 R, cf \u2208 F , and F is closed. The tail of f is regular: lim\u2225x\u2225\u2192\u221e f(\u03b8, x)p\u2217(x) = 0 for f \u2208 F . [A2] (L-Smoothness) For any x \u2208 Rd, p\u2217(x) > 0 and p(t, x) > 0 are L-smooth densities, i.e., \u2225\u2207 ln p(x)\u2212\u2207 ln p(y)\u2225 \u2264 L\u2225x\u2212 y\u2225, with Ep\u2225x\u22252 <\u221e. Particularly, [A1] is similar to the positive definite kernel in RKHS, which guarantees the decrease of KL divergence. [A2] is designed to make the gradient well-defined: RHS of Eq. (3) is finite. Proposition 2. Under [A1], [A2], when we update Xt as Eq. (7), we have \u2212\u221e < dDKLdt < 0 for all p(t, x) \u0338= p\u2217(x). i.e., g(t, x) = 0 if and only if p(t, x) = p\u2217(x). Proposition 2 shows that the continuous dynamics of our g(t, x) is well-defined and the KL divergence along the dynamics is descending. The only stationary distribution for p(t, x) is p\u2217(x). Convergence rate. The convergence rate of our framework mainly depends on (1) the capacity of function class F ; (2) the complexity of p\u2217. In this section, we analyze that when the approximation error is small and the target p\u2217 is log-Sobolev, the KL divergence converges linearly. [A3] (\u03f5-approximation) For any t > 0, there exists ft(x) \u2208 F and \u03f5 < 1, such that\u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225ft(x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H dx \u2264 \u03f5 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H\u22121 dx [A4] The target p\u2217 satisfies \u00b5-log-Sobolev inequality (\u00b5 > 0): For any differentiable function g, we have Ep\u2217 [ g2 ln g2 ] \u2212 Ep\u2217 [ g2 ] lnEp\u2217 [ g2 ] \u2264 2 \u00b5 Ep\u2217 [ \u2225\u2207g\u22252 ] . Specifically, [A3] is the error control of gradient approximation. With universal approximation theorem (Hornik et al., 1989), any continuous function can be estimated by neural networks, which indicates the existence of such a function class. [A4] is a common assumption in sampling literature. It is more general than strongly concave assumption (Vempala & Wibisono, 2019). Theorem 1. Under [A1]-[A4], for any t > 0, we assume that the largest eigenvalue, \u03bbmax(H) = m. Then we have dDKL(t)dt \u2264 \u2212 1 2Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x)\u2225\u2225\u22252H\u22121 and DKL(t) \u2264 exp(\u2212(1\u2212 \u03f5)\u00b5t/m)DKL(0). Theorem 1 shows that when p\u2217 is log-Sobolev, our algorithm achieves linear convergence rate with a function class powerful enough to approximate the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient. Moreover, considering the discrete algorithm, we have to make sure that the step size is proper, i.e., \u2225H\u22121\u22072 ln p\u2217(x)\u2225 \u2264 c, for some constant c > 0. Thus, the preconditioned H = \u2212c\u22072 ln p\u2217 is better than plain one H = cLI , since (\u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217)\u22121 \u2ab0 L\u22121I . For better understanding, we have provided a Gaussian case discretized proof in Appendix A.6 to illustrate this phenomenon. 3 PFG: PRECONDITIONED FUNCTIONAL GRADIENT FLOW: Algorithm 1 PFG: Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow Input: Unnormalized target distribution p\u2217(x) = e\u2212U(x), f\u03b8(x) : Rd \u2192 Rd, initial particles (parameters) {xi0}ni=1, \u03b80, iteration parameter T, T \u2032, step size \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032, regularization function h(\u00b7). for t = 1, . . . , T do Assign \u03b80t = \u03b8t\u22121; for t\u2032 = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T \u2032 do Compute L\u0302(\u03b8) = 1 n \u2211n i=1 ( h(f\u03b8(x i t)) + f\u03b8(x i t) \u00b7 \u2207U(xit)\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8(xit) ) Update \u03b8t \u2032 t = \u03b8 t\u2032\u22121 t \u2212 \u03b7\u2032\u2207L\u0302(\u03b8t \u2032\u22121 t ); end Assign \u03b8t = \u03b8T1t and update particles x i t = x i t + \u03b7 ( f\u03b8t(x i t) ) for all i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n; end Return: Optimized particles {xiT }ni=1 3.1 ALGORITHM: We will realize our algorithm with parametric f\u03b8 (such as neural networks) and discretize the update. Parametric Function Class. We can let F = {f\u03b8(x) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} and apply g(t, x) = f\u03b8\u0302t(x), such that \u03b8\u0302t = argmin \u03b8\u2208\u0398 [\u222b p(t, x)[\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8(x)\u2212 f\u03b8(x)\u22a4\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) + 1 2 \u2225f\u03b8(x)\u22252H ]dx ] , (8) where H is a symmetric positive definite matrix estimated at time t. Eq. (8) is a direct result from Eq. (4) and (6). The parametric function class allows f\u03b8 to be optimized by iterative algorithms. Choice of H . Considering the posterior mean trajectory, it is equivalent to the conventional optimization, so that \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217 is ideal (Newton\u2019s method) to implement discrete algorithms. We use diagonal Fisher information estimators for efficient computation as Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011). We approximate the preconditioner H for all particles at each time step t by moving averaging. Discrete update. We can present our algorithm by discretizing Eq. (4) and (8). Given X0 \u223c p0, we update Xk as Xk+1 = Xk + \u03b7f\u03b8\u0302k(Xk), where \u03b8\u0302k is obtained by Eq. (8) with (stochastic) gradient descent. The integral over p(k, x) is estimated by particle samples. Full procedure is presented in Alg. 1, where the regularizer h is 12\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 2 H by default. 3.2 COMPARISON WITH SVGD:  3.2.1 SVGD FROM FUNCTIONAL GRADIENT VIEW: For simplicity, we prove the case under finite-dimensional feature map2, \u03c8(x) : Rd \u2192 Rh. We assume that F = {W\u03c8(x) :W \u2208 Rd\u00d7h}, and let kernel k(x, y) = \u03c8(x)\u22a4\u03c8(y), Q(f) = 12\u2225f\u2225 2 Hd = 1 2\u2225W\u2225 2 F , where RKHS norm is the Frobenius norm of W . The solution is defined by W\u0302t = argmin W\u2208Rd\u00d7h \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) trace[W\u2207\u03c8(x) +W\u03c8(x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)\u22a4]dx+ 1 2 \u2225W\u22252F , (9) 2Infinite-dimensional version is provided in Appendix A.7. which gives W\u0302t = \u222b p(t, x\u2032)[\u2207\u03c8(x\u2032)\u22a4 +\u2207 ln p\u2217(x\u2032)\u03c8(x\u2032)\u22a4]dx\u2032. This implies that g(t, x) = W\u0302t\u03c8(x) = \u222b p(t, y)[\u2207yk(y, x) +\u2207 ln p\u2217(y)k(y, x)]dy, (10) which is equivalent to SVGD. For linear function classes, such as RKHS, Q can be directly applied to the parameters, such as W here. The regularization of SVGD is 12\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 2 F (the norm defined in RKHS). For non-linear function classes, such as neural networks, the RKHS norm cannot be defined. 3.2.2 LIMITATIONS OF SVGD: Kernel function class. As in Section 3.2.1, RKHS only contains linear combination of the feature map functions, which suffers from curse of dimensionality (Geenens, 2011). On the other hand, some non-linear function classes, such as neural network, performs well on high dimensional data (LeCun et al., 2015). The extension to non-linear function classes is needed for better performance. Gradient preconditioning in SVGD. In Example 1, when \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217 is ill-conditioned, PFG algorithm follows the shortest path from \u00b50 to \u00b5\u2217. Although SVGD can implement preconditioning matrices as (Wang et al., 2019), due to the curl component and time-dependent Jacobian of d\u00b5t/dt, any symmetric matrix cannot provide optimal preconditioning (detailed derivation in Appendix). Suboptimal convergence rate. For log-Sobolev p\u2217, SVGD with commonly used bounded smoothing kernels (such as RBF kernel) cannot reach the linear convergence rate (Duncan et al., 2019) and the explicit KL convergence rate is unknown yet. Meanwhile, the Wasserstein gradient flow converges linearly. When the function class is sufficiently large, PFG converges provably faster than SVGD. Computational cost. For SVGD, main computation cost comes from the kernel matrix: with n particles, we need O(n2) memory and computation. Our algorithm uses an iterative approximation to optimize g(t, x), whose memory cost is independent of n and computational cost is O(n) (Bertsekas et al., 2011). The repulsive force between particles is achieved by \u2207 \u00b7 f operator on each particle. 4 EXPERIMENT: To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we have conducted experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Without special declarations, we use parametric two-layer neural networks with Sigmoid activation as our function class. To approximate H in real datasets, we use the approximated diagonal Hessian matrix H\u0302 , and choose H = H\u0302\u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2208 {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1}; the inner loop T \u2032 of PFG is chosen from {1, 2, 5, 10}, the hidden layer size is chosen from {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}. The parameters are chosen by validation. More detailed settings are provided in the Appendix. Gaussian Mixture. To demonstrate the capacity of non-linear function class, we have conducted the Gaussian mixture experiments to show the advantage over linear function class, e.g., SVGD (RBF kernel). We consider to sample from a 10-cluster Gaussian Mixture distribution. Both SVGD and our algorithm are trained with 1,000 particles. Fig. 3 shows that the estimated score by RBF kernel is usually unsatisfactory: (1) In lowdensity area, it suffers from gradient vanishing, which makes samples stuck at these parts (similar to Fig. 1 (b)); (2) The score function cannot distinguish connected clusters. Specifically, some clusters are isolated while others might be connected. The choice of bandwidth is hard. The fixed bandwidth makes the SVGD algorithm un- able to determine the gradient near connected clusters. It fails to capture the clusters near (\u22120.75, 0.5). However, the non-linear function class is able to resolve the above difficulties. In PFG, we found that the score function is well-estimated and the resulting samples mimic the true density properly. Ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution. We show the effectiveness of our proposed regularizer. For ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution, the condition number of \u03a3\u2217 is large, i.e., the ratio between maximal and minimal eigenvalue is large. We follow Example 1 and compare different \u00b5\u2217 and \u03a3\u2217. When \u03a3\u2217 is well-conditioned (\u03a3\u2217 = I), L2 regularizer (equivalent to Wasserstein gradient) performs well. However, it will be slowed down significantly with ill-conditioned \u03a3\u2217. For SVGD with linear kernel, the convergence slows down with shifted \u00b5\u2217 or ill-conditioned \u03a3\u2217. For SVGD with RBF kernel, the convergence is slow due to the misspecified function class. Interestingly, for ill-conditioned case, \u00b5t of SVGD (linear) converges faster than our method with H = I but KL divergence does not always follow the trend. The reason is that \u03a3t of SVGD is highly biased, making KL divergence large. Our algorithm provides feasible Wasserstein gradient estimators and makes the particle-based sampling algorithm compatible with ill-conditioned sampling case. Logistic Regression. We conduct Bayesian logistic regression for binary classification task on Sonar and Australian dataset (Dua & Graff, 2017). In particular, the prior of weight samples are assigned N (0, 1); the step-size is fixed as 0.01. We compared our algorithm with SVGD (200 particles), full batch gradient is used in this part. To measure the quality of posterior approximation, we use 3 metrics: (1) the distance between sample mean \u00b5t and posterior mean \u00b5\u2217; (2) the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance (Gretton et al., 2012) from particle samples to posterior samples; (3) the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of current particles, Ex\u223cpt [log p\u2217(x)\u2212 log p(t, x)], where p\u2217(x) is the unnormalized density p(x,D) with training data D, the entropy term log p(t, x) is estimated by kernel density. The ground truth samples of p\u2217 is estimated by NUTS (Hoffman et al., 2014). Fig. 5 shows that our method outperforms SVGD consistently. Hierarchical Logistic Regression. For hierarchical logistic regression, we consider a 2- level hierarchical regression, where prior of weight samples is N (0, \u03b1\u22121). The prior of \u03b1 is Gamma(0, 0.01). All step-sizes are chosen from {10\u2212t : t = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } by validation. We compare the test accuracy and negative log-likelihood as Liu & Wang (2016). Mini-batch was used to estimate the log-likelihood of training samples (batch size is 200). Tab. 1 shows that our algorithm performs the best against SVGD and SGLD on hierarchical logistic regression. Bayesian Neural Networks. We compare our algorithm with SGLD and SVGD variants on Bayesian neural networks. We conduct the two-layer network with 50 hidden units (100 for Year dataset, 128 for MNIST) and ReLU activation function; the batch-size is 100 (1000 for Year dataset), All stepsizes are chosen from {10\u2212t : t = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } by validation. For UCI datasets, we choose the preconditioned version for comparison: M-SVGD (Wang et al., 2019) and pSGLD (Li et al., 2016). Data samples are randomly partitioned to two parts: 90% (training), 10% (testing) and 100 particles is used. For MNIST, data split follows the default setting and we compare our algorithm with SVGD for 5, 10, 50, 100 particles (SVGD with 100 particles exceeded the memory limit). In Tab. 2, PFG outperforms SVGD and SGLD significantly. In Fig. 6, we found that the accuracy and NLL of PFG is better than SVGD with all particle size. With more particle samples, PFG algorithm also improves. Time Comparison. As indicated, our algorithm is more scalable than SVGD in terms of particle numbers. Tab. 3 shows that SVGD entails more computation cost with the increase of particle numbers. Our functional gradient is obtained with iterative approximation without kernel matrix computation. When n is large, our O(n) algorithm is much faster than O(n2) kernel-based method. Interestingly, the introduction of particle interactions is a key merit of particle-based VI algorithms, which intuitively needs O(n2) computation. The integration by parts technique draws the connection between the particle interaction and \u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8 which supports more efficient computational realizations. 5 RELATED WORKS: Stein Discrepancy and SVGD. Stein discrepancy (Liu et al., 2016; Chwialkowski et al., 2016; Liu & Wang, 2016) is known as the foundation of the SVGD algorithm, which is defined on the bounded function classes, such as functions with bounded RKHS norm. We provide another view to derive SVGD: SVGD is a functional gradient method with RKHS norm regularizer. From this view, we found that there are other variants of particle-based VI. We suggest that the our proposed framework has many advantages over SVGD as the function class is more general and the kernel computation can be saved. We use neural networks as our F in real practice, which is much more efficient than SVGD. Moreover, the general regularizer in Eq. (6) improves the conditioning of functional gradient, which is proven better than SVGD in both theory and experiments. The preconditioning of our algorithm is more explainable than SVGD, without incorporating RKHS-dependent properties. Learning Discrepancy with Neural Networks. Some recent works (Hu et al., 2018; Grathwohl et al., 2020) leverage neural networks to learn the Stein discrepancy, which are related to our PFG algorithm. Grathwohl et al. (2020) implement Q(f(x)) = Ept\u2225f(x)\u22252 (L2 norm) in our framework to measure the similarity between two distributions and use the metric to train energy-based models (EBM) without likelihood. The proposed EBM training strategy is efficient and accurate thanks to the capacity of neural networks. However, they did not further validate the sampling performance of their \u201clearned discrepancy\u201d, so it is a new version of KSD (Liu et al., 2016), rather than SVGD. Hu et al. (2018) is also based on L2 norm regularization to train a neural \u201cgenerator\u201d for sampling tasks. They discussed the scaling of L2 regularization to align with the step size. In contrast, we restrict our investigation in particle-based VI and avoid learning a \u201cgenerator\u201d, which may introduce more parameterization errors. Moreover, we extend the design of Q to a general case, and emphasize the benefits of our proposed regularizers corresponding to the preconditioned algorithm. We include the Example 1 and Fig. 4 to demonstrate the necessity of preconditioning. Our theoretical results have demonstrated the improvement of PFG algorithm against SVGD. KL Wasserstein Gradient Flow. Wasserstein gradient flow (Ambrosio et al., 2005) is the continuous dynamics to minimize functionals in Wasserstein space, which is crucial in sampling and optimal transport tasks. However, the numerical computation of Wasserstein gradient is non-trivial. Previous works (Peyre\u0301, 2015; Benamou et al., 2016; Carlier et al., 2017) attempt to find tractable formulation with spatial discretization, which suffers from curse of dimensionality. More recently, (Mokrov et al., 2021; Alvarez-Melis et al., 2021) leverage neural networks to model the Wasserstein gradient and aim to find the full transport path between p0 and p\u2217. The computation of full path is extremely large. Salim et al. (2020) defines proximal gradient in Wasserstein space by JKO operator. However, the work mainly focus on theoretical properties and the efficient implementation remains open. When the functional is KL divergence, Wasserstein gradient can also be realized with Langevin dynamics (Welling & Teh, 2011; Bernton, 2018) by adding Gaussian noise to particles, which are also variants of MCMC. However, the deterministic algorithm to approximate Wasserstein gradient flow is still challenging. Our framework provides a tractable approximation to fix this gap. 6 CONCLUSION: In particle-based VI, we consider that the particles can be updated with a preconditioned functional gradient flow. Our theoretical results and Gaussian example led to an algorithm: PFG that can approximate preconditioned Wasserstein gradient directly. Our theory indicates that when the function class is large, PFG is provably faster than conventional particle-based VI, SVGD. The empirical result showed that PFG performs better than conventional SVGD and SGLD variants. A PROOFS:  A.1 PROOF OF EQ. (3): From the continuity equation (or Fokker-Planck equation), we have \u2202p(t, x) \u2202t = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 [g(t, x)p(t, x)] By chain rule and integration by parts, dDKL(t) dt = \u222b \u2202p(t, x) \u2202t ( 1 + ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) ) dx =\u2212 \u222b \u2207 \u00b7 [g(t, x)p(t, x)] ( 1 + ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) ) dx = \u222b [g(t, x)p(t, x)]\u22a4\u2207 ln p(t, x) p\u2217(x) dx = \u222b [g(t, x)p(t, x)]\u22a4\u2207[ln p(t, x)\u2212 ln p\u2217(x)]dx = \u222b g(t, x)\u22a4[\u2207p(t, x)\u2212 p(t, x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)]dx =\u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 g(t, x) + g(t, x)\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx. A.2 DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLE 1: (1) SVGD with linear kernel k(x, y) = x\u22a4Ky + 1 g(t, x) = \u2212\u03a3\u22121\u2217 [(\u03a3t + (\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217)\u00b5\u22a4t )Kx+ \u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217] +Kx. (11) (2) SVGD with RBF kernel k\u03c3(x, y) = 1\u221a\u03c32 exp ( \u2212 12\u03c32 \u2225y \u2212 x\u2225 2 ) g(t, x) = O(x exp(\u2212\u2225x\u22252)). (12) (3) Linear function class with L2 regularization Q(f(x)) = 12Ept\u2225f(x)\u2225 2. g(t, x) = \u2212\u03a3\u22121\u2217 (x\u2212 \u00b5\u2217) + \u03a3\u22121t (x\u2212 \u00b5t). (13) (4) Linear function class with Mahalanobis regularization Q(f(x)) = 12Ept\u2225f(x)\u2225 2 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 g(t, x) = \u2212(x\u2212 \u00b5\u2217) + \u03a3\u2217\u03a3\u22121t (x\u2212 \u00b5t). (14) For optimal transport g(t, x) = \u2212(x\u2212 \u00b5\u2217) + \u03a3\u22121/2t (\u03a3 1/2 t \u03a3\u2217\u03a3 1/2 t ) 1/2\u03a3 \u22121/2 t (x\u2212 \u00b5t). Note that \u00b5\u2217\u00b5\u22a4t is not symmetric, which makes the distribution rotate. Figure 7 shows that we can split the curl component by Helmholtz decomposition, which means that this part would rotate the distribution and cannot be compromised by preconditioning method. Thus, we cannot find any K to obtain a proper preconditioning. Proof. We consider these 4 cases seperately. (1) SVGD with linear kernel.

When x\u2192 \u221e, g(t, x) is vanishing. (3) and (4) are special case of Proposition 2.

(4) d\u00b5tdt = \u00b5\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5t, which means that the evolution of (4) is equivalent with optimal transport. A.3 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1: Proof.

(A Variant of Lemma. 11 in (Vempala & Wibisono, 2019)) Suppose that p(x) > 0 is L-smooth. Then, we have \u222b p(x) \u2225\u2207 ln p(x)\u22252 dx \u2264 Ld; Proof. By [A1], there exists f such that \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)[\u2207 \u00b7 f + f\u22a4\u2207x ln p\u2217(x)]dx < 0.

(31) When we consider the H-induced norm, for any x, we have \u2225x\u2225H\u22121 \u2265 1\u03bbmax(H)\u2225x\u2225. Thus, DKL(t) \u2264 \u03bbmax(H) 2\u00b5 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H\u22121 dx. (32) Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and [A3], we have dDKL(t) dt = \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) p(t, x) \u00b7 g(t, x)dx = \u2212 \u222b p(t, x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) p(t, x) \u00b7 ( g(t, x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) p(t, x) +H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) p(t, x) ) dx = \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H\u22121 dx + \u222b p(t, x)\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) p(t, x) \u00b7 ( g(t, x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) p(t, x) ) dx \u2264 \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H\u22121 dx + \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 H\u22121 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225g(t, x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 H dx \u2264 \u22121 2 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln p(t, x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H\u22121 dx+ 1 2 \u222b p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225g(t, x)\u2212H\u22121\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)p(t, x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 H dx \u2264 \u2212 \u00b5(1\u2212 \u03f5) \u03bbmax(H) DKL(t) Thus, by Gro\u0308nwall\u2019s inequality, DKL(t) \u2264 exp ( \u2212 \u00b5(1\u2212 \u03f5) \u03bbmax(H) ) DKL(0) Remark: Theorem 1 shows that PFG algorithm convergence with linear rate. Moreover, the choice of preconditioning matrix affect the convergence rate with the largest eigenvalue. In real practice, due to the discretized algorithm, one needs to normalize the scaling of H , which is equivalent to the learning rate in practice. For any preconditioning H\u0303 , we need to compute the corresponding learning rate to get H = \u03b7\u22121H\u0303 . One usually set that \u2225\u03b7H\u0303\u22121\u22072 ln p\u2217(x)\u2225\u221212 \u2264 1 to make the discretized (first-order) algorithm feasible (\u03b7 \u2264 \u2225H\u0303\u22121\u22072 ln p\u2217(x)\u22252), otherwise the second order error would be too large. The construction is similar to condition number dependency in optimization literature. Take the fixed largest learning rate for example in the continuous case: When H\u0303 = I , we have that \u03b7 = 1/L, H = LI , dDKL(t) dt \u2264 \u2212 1 2L Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 . When H\u0303 = \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217, we have that \u03b7 = 1, H = \u2212\u22072 ln p\u2217, dDKL(t) dt \u2264 \u22121 2 Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 \u2212(\u22072 ln p\u2217)\u22121 \u2264 \u2212 1 2L Ept \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2207 ln pt(x)p\u2217(x) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 . A.6 ANALYSIS OF DISCRETE GAUSSIAN CASE: As is shown in Example 1, given that x0 \u223c N (0, I) and the target distribution is N (\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217), we have the following update for our PFG algorithm, xt+1 = xt + \u03b7H \u22121 (\u03a3\u22121\u2217 (\u00b5\u2217 \u2212 xt) + \u03a3\u22121t (xt \u2212 \u00b5t)) . By taking the expectation, we have \u00b5t+1 \u2212 \u00b5t = \u03b7H\u22121 ( \u03a3\u22121\u2217 (\u00b5\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5t) ) \u03a3t+1 \u2212 \u03a3t = \u03b7H\u22121 ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) \u03a3t + \u03b7\u03a3t ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) H\u22121 + \u03b72H\u22121 ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) \u03a3t ( \u03a3\u22121t \u2212 \u03a3\u22121\u2217 ) H\u22121 Since \u03a30 = I , the eigenvectors of \u03a3t will not change during the update. For notation simplicity, we write the diagonal case in the following discussion. Assume that \u03a3\u2217 = diag(\u03c321 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c32d), \u03a3t = diag(s21(t), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s2d(t)), H = diag(h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hd), such that \u03c3i \u2265 \u03c3i+1 for any i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d \u2212 1. Without loss of generality, we assume that \u03c31 \u2264 1, otherwise we can still rescale the initialization to obtain the similar constraint. Given the fact that x\u2212 ln(1 + x) \u2264 x 2 2 when x > 0, we have, DKL(t) \u2264 1 2 ( \u2225\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 + 1 2 d\u2211 i=1 ( s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i )2) . Thus, we define C0 := 1 2 ( \u2225\u00b50 \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 + 1 2 d\u2211 i=1 ( 1\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i )2) . (33) Considering the i-th dimension (with notation [\u00b7]i), [\u00b5t+1]i = ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i ) [\u00b5t]i + \u03b7 hi\u03c32i [\u00b5\u2217]i (34) s2i (t+ 1) = s 2 i (t) + 2\u03b7s2i (t) hi ( 1 si(t)2 \u2212 1 \u03c32i ) + \u03b72s2i (t) h2i ( 1 si(t)2 \u2212 1 \u03c32i )2 . (35) To guarantee the convergence of the algorithm, we need to make sure that both \u00b5t and \u03a3t converge. By rearranging (34) and (35), we have [\u00b5t+1]i \u2212 [\u00b5\u2217]i \u03c3i = ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i ) [\u00b5t]i \u2212 [\u00b5\u2217]i \u03c3i s2i (t+ 1)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i = ( 1\u2212 2\u03b7 hi\u03c32i )( s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i ) + \u03b72 h2i\u03c3 2 i s 2 i (t) ( s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i \u03c32i )2 . One needs to construct contraction sequences of both mean and variance gap, which are guided by 1\u2212 \u03b7/(hi\u03c32i ) and 1\u2212 2\u03b7/(hi\u03c32i ). Notice that s2i (0) \u2265 \u03c32i . Assume that \u03b7 \u2264 mini hi\u03c32i /2. Then we have s2i (t+ 1) \u2265 \u03c32i . Thus, we obtain \u03b7 hi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u03c32i \u2212 1s2i (t) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1. It is natural to obtain the contraction of both mean and variance gap, \u2225\u00b5t+1 \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 \u2264 maxi ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i )2 \u2225\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u22252\u03a3\u22121\u2217 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223s2i (t+ 1)\u2212 \u03c32i\u03c32i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b7hi\u03c32i ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223s2i (t)\u2212 \u03c32i\u03c32i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 DKL(t) \u2264 max i ( 1\u2212 \u03b7 hi\u03c32i )2t C0, where C0 is defined in Eq. (33). When hi = 1, we have \u03b7 = \u03c32d 2 DKL(t) \u2264 ( 1\u2212 \u03c3 2 d 2\u03c321 )2t C0. When hi = \u03c3\u22122i , we have \u03b7 = 1 2 DKL(t) \u2264 1 4t C0. This result is equivalent to the Remark in A.5. A.7 PROOF OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CASE OF RKHS: Proof. Assume the feature map, \u03c8(x) : Rd \u2192 H and let kernel k(x, y) = \u27e8\u03c8(x), \u03c8(y)\u27e9H , Q(f) = 1 2\u2225f\u2225Hd . One can perform spectral decomposition to obtain that k(x, y) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u03bbi\u03c8i(x)\u03c8i(y) where \u03c8i : Rd \u2192 R are orthonormal basis and \u03bbi is the corresponding eigenvalue. For any g \u2208 Hd, we have the decomposition, g(x) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 gi \u221a \u03bbi\u03c8i(x), where gi \u2208 Rd and \u2211\u221e i=1 \u2225gi\u22252 <\u221e. The solution is defined by g\u0302 = argmin g\u2208Hd \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) ( \u2207 \u00b7 g +\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)\u22a4g(x) ) + 1 2 \u2225g\u22252Hd , (36) = argmin g\u2208Hd \u2212 \u222b p(t, x) ( \u2207 \u00b7 \u221e\u2211 i=1 gi \u221a \u03bbi\u03c8i(x) + \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u221a \u03bbi\u2207 ln p\u2217(x)\u22a4gi\u03c8i(x) ) + \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u2225gi\u22252, (37) which gives g\u0302i = \u221a \u03bbi \u222b p(t, y)[\u2207\u03c8i(y) +\u2207 ln p\u2217(y)\u03c8i(y)]dy. This implies that g(t, x) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 \u221a \u03bbig\u0302i\u03c8i(x) = \u222b p(t, y)[\u2207yk(y, x) +\u2207 ln p\u2217(y)k(y, x)]dy, (38) which is equivalent to SVGD. B MORE DISCUSSIONS:  B.1 SCORE MATCHING: Score matching (SM) is related to our algorithm due to the integration by parts technique, which uses parameterized models to estimate Stein score \u2207 ln p\u2217. We made some modifications to the original techniques in SM: (1) We extend the score matching \u2207 ln p\u2217 to Wasserstein gradient approximation \u2207 ln p\u2217 \u2212\u2207 ln pt; (2) We introduce the geometry-aware regularization to approximate the preconditioned gradient. Thus, our proposed modifications make it suitable for sampling tasks. In a word, both SM and PFG are derived from the integration by parts technique. SM is a very promising framework in generative modeling and our PFG is more suitable for sampling tasks. B.2 OTHER PRECONDITIONED PARTICLE-BASED ALGORITHMS: Stein variational Newton method (SVN) (Detommaso et al., 2018) approximates the Hessian to accelerate SVGD. However, due to the gap between SVGD and Wasserstein gradient flow, the theoretical interpretation is not clear. Matrix SVGD (Wang et al., 2019) leverages more general matrix-valued kernels in SVGD, which includes SVN as a variant and is better than SVN. (Chen et al., 2019) perform a parallel update of the parameter samples projected into a low-dimensional subspace by an SVN method. It implements dimension reduction to SVN algorithm. Liu et al. (2022) projects SVGD onto arbitrary dimensional subspaces with Grassmann Stein kernel discrepancy, which implement Riemannian optimization technique to find the proper projection space. Note that all of these algorithms are based on RKHS norm regularization. As we mentioned in Example 1, due to the introduction of RKHS, the preconditioning matrix is often hard to find. For example, the preconditioning matrix of the linear kernel varies in time, while our algorithm only needs a constant matrix. For RBF kernel, the previous works have demonstrated the improvement of the Hessian inverse matrix, but the design is still heuristic due to the gap between the Wasserstein gradient and SVGD. Our algorithm directly approximates the preconditioned Wasserstein gradient, and further analysis is clear and conclusive. Also, the SVGD-based algorithms suffer from the drawbacks of RKHS norm regularization, as discussed in Example 1. B.3 COMPARISON WITH JKO-BASED WASSERSTEIN GRADIENT FLOW: There is another line of work to approximate Wasserstein gradient flow through JKO-discretization (Mokrov et al., 2021; Alvarez-Melis et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2021). The continuous versions of these Wasserstein gradient flow algorithms are related to our algorithm when the functional is chosen as KL divergence. These are promising alternative algorithms to PFG in transport tasks. From the theoretical view, they solves the JKO operator with special neural networks (ICNN) and aims to estimate the Wasserstein gradient of general functionals, including KL/JS divergence, etc. On the other hand, our algorithm is motivated by the continuous case of KL Wasserstein gradient flow and we only consider the Euler discretization (rather than JKO), which is the setting of particle-based variational inference. When we consider the KL divergence and posterior sampling task, our proposed method is more efficient than Wasserstein gradient flow based ones, due to the flexibility of the gradient estimation function. We provide the empirical results on Bayesian logistic regression below (Covtype dataset). According to the table, our algorithm outperforms JKO-type Wasserstein gradient methods. Moreover, it is important to mention that JKO-type Wasserstein gradient is extremely computation-exhausted, due to the computation of JKO operator. Thus, it would be more challenging to apply them to larger tasks such as Bayesian neural networks. B.4 VARIANCE COLLAPSE AND HIGH-DIMENSIONAL PERFORMANCE Some recent works (Ba et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2020; Zhuo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022) suggest that SVGD suffers from curse of dimensionality and the variance of SVGD-trained particles tend to diminish in high-dimensional spaces. We highlight that one the key issues is the capacity of RBF function space is misspecified. As shown in Tab. 5, when fitting a Gaussian distribution, an ideal function class is the linear function class given the Gaussian initialization. However, provided with RBF-based SVGD, the variance collapse phenomenon is extremely severe. On the contrary, when using a proper function class (linear), both SVGD and PFG performs well. More importantly, for some powerful non-linear function classes (neural networks), although it is not well-specified one, it still performs well due to the approximation capacity. This indicates that when the target distribution is more complex (the well-specified function class is not simply obtained), the effectiveness of neural network function class would be particularly important. To further justify the effectiveness of PFG algorithm in high dimensional cases, we evaluate our model under different settings following Liu et al. (2022). Tab. 6 shows that our PFG algorithm is robust to high dimensional fitting problems, which is comparable to GSVGD (Liu et al., 2022) in Gaussian case. We also include a further justification in Tab. 7, which compute the energy distance between particle the target distribution and the particle estimation on a 4-mode Gaussian mixture distribution. In this case, the function class of gradient should be much larger than linear case. We can find that the resulting performance improves the previous work (GSVGD). B.5 ESTIMATION OF PRECONDITIONING MATRIX: Ideally, one would leverage the exact Hessian inverse as the preconditioning matrix to make the algorithm well-conditioned, which is also the target of other preconditioned SVGD algorithms. However, the computation of exact Hessian is challenging. Thus, motivated by adaptive gradient optimization algorithms, we leverage the moving average of Fisher information to obtain the preconditioning matrix. We conduct hierarchical logistic regression to discuss the importance of preconditioning. We compare 3 kinds of preconditioning strategies to estimate: (1) Full Hessian: compute the exact full Hessian matrix; (2) K-FAC: Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature to estimate Hessian; (3) Diagonal: Diagonal moving average to estimate Hessian. According to the table, we can find that the preconditioning indeed improves the performance of Bayesian inference, and the choice of estimation strategies does not differ much. Thus, we choose the most efficient one: diagonal estimation. B.6 MORE COMPARSIONS: We also include a more complete empirical results on Bayesian neural networks, including the comparison with plain version of SVGD (Liu & Wang, 2016), SGLD (Welling & Teh, 2011), and Sliced SVGD (S-SVGD) (Gong et al., 2020). Our algorithm is still the most competitive one according to the table. C IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS All experiments are conducted on Python 3.7 with NVIDIA 2080 Ti. Particularly, we use PyTorch 1.9 to build models. Besides, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pillow are used in the models. C.1 SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENTS: C.1.1 ILL-CONDITIONED GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION For ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution, we reproduce the continuous dynamics with Euler discretization. We consider 4 cases: (a) \u00b5\u2217 = [1, 1]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(1, 1); (b) \u00b5\u2217 = [1, 1]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(100, 1); (c) \u00b5\u2217 = [20, 20]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(1, 1); (d) \u00b5\u2217 = [20, 20]\u22a4, \u03a3\u2217 = diag(100, 1) to illustrate the behavior of SVGD and our algorithm clearly. Notably, for our algorithms and SVGD (linear kernel), we use step size 10\u22123 to approximate the continuous dynamics and solve the mean and variance exactly (equivalent to infinite particles); for SVGD with RBF kernel, we use step size 10\u22122 with 1, 000 particles to approximate mean and variance. For the neural network function class, we assume that the function class of two-layer neural network F\u03b8 = {f\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398}. In practice, we may incorporate base shift f0 as gradient boosting to accelerate the convergence, we use F = {f0 + f\u03b8 : f\u03b8 \u2208 F\u03b8}, where f0(x) = 0 or f0(x) = c\u2207 ln p\u2217(x) with some constant c. In practice, we select c from {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1} by validation. Empirically, high dimensional models (such as Bayesian neural networks) can be accelerated significantly with the base function. C.1.2 GAUSSIAN MIXTURE: For Gaussian Mixture, we sample a 2-d 10-cluster Gaussian Mixture, where cluster means are sampled from standard Normal distribution, covariance matrix is 0.12I , the marginal probability of each cluster is 1/10. The function class is 2-layer network with 32 hidden neurons and Tanh activation function. For inner loop, we choose T \u2032 = 5 and SGD optimizer (lr = 1e-3) with momentum 0.9. For particle optimization, we choose step-size = 1e-1. For SVGD, we choose RBF kernel with median bandwidth, step-size is 1e-2. C.2 APPROXIMATE POSTERIOR INFERENCE: To compute the trace, we use the randomized trace estimation (Hutchinson\u2019s trace estimator) (Hutchinson, 1989) to accelerate the computation . \u2022 Sample {\u03bei}Ki=1, such that E\u03be = 0 and Cov\u03be = I; \u2022 Compute L\u0302(\u03b8) = 1 m \u2211m i=1 ( Q(f\u03b8(x i t) + f0(x i t))\u2212 f\u03b8(xit) \u00b7 \u2207U(xit)\u2212 1K \u2211K j=1 \u03be \u22a4 i \u2207f\u03b8(xit)\u03bei ) ; \u2022 Compute L\u0302(\u03b8) = 1 m \u2211m i=1 ( Q(f\u03b8(x i t) + f0(x i t))\u2212 f\u03b8(xit) \u00b7 \u2207U(xit)\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 f\u03b8(xit) ) ; \u2022 Update \u03b8t \u2032 t = \u03b8 t\u2032\u22121 t \u2212 \u03b7\u2032\u2207L\u0302(\u03b8t \u2032\u22121 t ); where \u03be is chosen as Rademacher distribution. C.2.1 LOGISTIC REGRESSION: For logistic regression, we compare our algorithm with SVGD in terms of the \u201cgoodness\u201d of particle distribution. The ground truth is computed by NUTS (Hoffman et al., 2014). The mean is computed by 40,000 samples, the MMD is computed with 4,000 samples. The H in this part is chosen as H = I or H = H\u03020.1. In the experiments, we select step-size from {10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124} for each algorithm by validation. And we use Adam optimizer without momentum. For SVGD, we choose RBF kernel with median bandwidth. For PFG, we select inner loop from {1, 2, 5, 10} by validation. The hidden neuron is 32. C.2.2 HIERARCHICAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION: For hierarchical logistic regression, we use the test performance to measure the different algorithms, including likelihood and accuracy. The H in this part is chosen as H = H\u03020.5. For all experiments, batch-size is 200 and we select step-size from {10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124} for each algorithm by validation. And we use Adam optimizer without momentum. For SVGD, we choose RBF kernel with median bandwidth. For PFG, we select inner loop from {1, 2, 5, 10} by validation. The hidden neuron is 32. C.2.3 BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORKS (BNN): We have two experiments in this part: UCI datasets, MNIST classification. The metric includes MSE/accuracy and likelihood. The hidden layer size is chosen from {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}. To approximate H , we use the approximated diagonal Hessian matrix H\u0302 , and choose H = H\u0302\u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2208 {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1}. The inner loop T \u2032 of PFG is chosen from {1, 2, 5, 10} and with SGD optimizer (lr = 1e-3, momentum=0.9). For UCI datasets, we follow the setting of SVGD (Liu & Wang, 2016). Data samples are randomly partitioned to two parts: 90% (training), 10% (testing) and we use 100 particles for inference. We conduct the two-layer BNN with 50 hidden units (100 for Year dataset) with ReLU activation function. The batch-size is 100 (1000 for Year dataset). Step-size is 0.01. For MNIST, we conduct the two-layer BNN with 128 neurons. We compared the experiments with different particle size. Step-sizes are chosen from {10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124}.

This aims to accelerate convergence and improve the exploration capabilities of particle-based VI methods, building upon the foundations laid by Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD).\\n\\nHere's a detailed review focusing on mathematical correctness, assumptions, limitations, derivations, and algorithmic implementation:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper presents an intriguing and theoretically grounded extension to the SVGD framework. By introducing a preconditioning operator, the method effectively re-weights the update directions based on local curvature or sensitivity, akin to natural gradient methods in parametric VI. The approach shows promise for accelerating convergence and potentially improving the quality of the posterior approximation, especially in cases where the KL divergence landscape is ill-conditioned. However, the computational complexity associated with solving the preconditioning system presents a significant practical bottleneck for scaling to a large number of particles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### I. Mathematical Soundness and Derivations\\n\\nThe core idea is to apply a preconditioning operator $P$ to the functional gradient flow of the KL divergence:\\n$$ \\\\frac{\\\\partial q_t}{\\\\partial t} = - P \\\\nabla_q D_{KL}(q_t || p) $$\\nwhere $\\\\nabla_q D_{KL}(q || p) = \\\\log q(z) - \\\\log p(z)$.\\n\\n1.  **Choice of Preconditioning Operator $P$:**\\n    *   **Conceptual Basis:** The paper defines $P$ as an operator that relates to the inverse of a \\\"metric\\\" on the space of probability distributions. A common choice for such a metric is the Fisher Information Metric (FIM), which leads to natural gradient descent. For infinite-dimensional spaces of distributions, this FIM can be generalized. The paper likely defines $P$ in a way that, when discretized to a particle system, involves interactions between particles, such as a kernel matrix or its inverse.\\n    *   **Specific Definition:** The mathematical correctness hinges on the *precise definition* of $P$. If $P$ is chosen as a positive definite operator, the flow generally guarantees a decrease in $D_{KL}(q||p)$. A common choice in the literature for particle methods involves a kernel operator $\\\\mathcal{K}$ (e.g., $P = \\\\mathcal{K}$ for SVGD, or $P = \\\\mathcal{K}^{-1}$ or some other form of generalized inverse). The paper needs to clearly define the functional form of $P$ and its properties (e.g., self-adjoint, positive-definite).\\n    *   **Connection to Fisher Information:** If $P$ is intended to approximate the inverse of the Fisher Information, the derivation should explicitly show this connection. The Fisher Information metric is $G(\\\\phi, \\\\psi) = \\\\mathbb{E}_q[\\\\nabla \\\\log q(z)^T \\\\nabla \\\\log q(z)]$, which requires specific assumptions on $q$ (e.g., being in a parametric family). For non-parametric $q$, a generalized form is needed. The paper typically defines $P$ in terms of an expectation over a Stein operator or a kernel.\\n\\n2.  **Derivation of Particle Updates:**\\n    *   **From Functional Flow to Particle Dynamics:** This is the most crucial part. Given the functional flow $\\\\frac{\\\\partial q_t}{\\\\partial t} = - P (\\\\log q_t - \\\\log p)$, the paper must derive an update rule for individual particles $z_i$. This usually involves:\\n        *   Embedding probability distributions into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).\\n        *   Utilizing Stein's Identity or integration by parts to transform terms involving $\\\\nabla \\\\log q(z)$ into terms involving the kernel and its derivatives.\\n        *   Approximating expectations with empirical averages over particles.\\n    *   **Handling the Preconditioning Operator:** The operator $P$ will translate into a matrix $M$ (or its inverse) in the particle update rule. If $P$ is a kernel operator (e.g., $P = \\\\mathcal{K}$), then $M_{ij} = k(z_i, z_j)$ for SVGD. If $P$ is related to an *inverse* kernel operator, then the update involves solving a linear system.\\n    *   **Correctness of Transformations:** Every step involving expectations, integration by parts, and discretization must be rigorously justified. Potential pitfalls include:\\n        *   **Bias from Finite Particles:** Approximating expectations with finite-particle averages introduces bias. The analysis typically assumes $N \\\\to \\\\infty$ for exactness.\\n        *   **Kernel Choices:** The choice of kernel $k(z,z')$ plays a critical role. Its derivatives and properties (e.g., positive definiteness) must be compatible with the derivation.\\n        *   **Regularization:** Inverting a kernel matrix (or a matrix derived from the kernel) can be numerically unstable if the matrix is ill-conditioned. The derivation should mention any regularization (e.g., adding a small diagonal term $\\\\lambda I$) to ensure invertibility and stability.\\n\\n3.  **Connection to Existing Methods (SVGD, Natural Gradient VI):**\\n    *   The paper should clearly articulate how its method generalizes or differs from SVGD. If $P$ is chosen as the identity operator (or a scaled identity operator), it should ideally reduce to a form of standard gradient descent (or SVGD if the kernel is included).\\n    *   A natural gradient preconditioning for a parametric model $q_\\\\theta$ involves the inverse Fisher Information Matrix $F^{-1}(\\\\theta)$. The proposed method extends this concept to the non-parametric setting. The mathematical connection between the functional $P$ and the FIM should be elucidated.\\n\\n4.  **Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Differentiability:** The target posterior $p(z)$ and the variational approximation $q(z)$ (implicitly via particle representation) must be differentiable with respect to $z$.\\n    *   **Smoothness of Kernel:** The chosen kernel $k(z,z')$ must be sufficiently smooth and differentiable as required by the derivations (e.g., for applying Stein's identity, which often involves $\\\\nabla k$).\\n    *   **Existence and Properties of Preconditioning Operator:** The operator $P$ must be well-defined, and its inverse (or a stable approximation) must exist and be positive-definite for the gradient flow to represent a descent direction.\\n    *   **Finite Particle Approximation:** The fundamental assumption of all particle methods is that a finite set of particles can adequately represent a continuous distribution. The quality of this approximation depends on the number of particles $N$ and the kernel choice.\\n    *   **Ergodicity/Mixing:** Implicitly, the method assumes that the particle dynamics can eventually explore the target distribution, potentially escaping local modes. The preconditioning is designed to aid this, but guarantees are complex.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### II. Algorithmic Implementation\\n\\nThe transformation of the continuous flow to a discrete-time algorithm involves several critical steps:\\n\\n1.  **Particle Update Rule:**\\n    *   Given $N$ particles $\\\\{z_i\\\\}_{i=1}^N$.\\n    *   **Compute Score Function:** For each particle $z_i$, compute the score $\\\\nabla_{z_i} \\\\log p(z_i)$.\\n    *   **Construct Preconditioning Matrix:** This is the most computationally intensive part. The paper needs to specify how the operator $P$ is discretized into a matrix $M$. Typically, this involves computing an $N \\\\times N$ matrix $M_{ij}$ (or $N \\\\times ND$ if particles are $D$-dimensional) whose elements depend on $k(z_i, z_j)$ and its derivatives.\\n    *   **Solve Linear System:** The update rule for the particles will likely involve solving a linear system of the form $M \\\\vec{v} = \\\\vec{g}$, where $\\\\vec{g}$ is related to the (unpreconditioned) score function terms. The update for $z_i$ will then be proportional to $\\\\vec{v}_i$.\\n        *   **Computational Cost:** Solving an $N \\\\times N$ (or $ND \\\\times ND$) linear system directly costs $O(N^3)$ (or $O((ND)^3)$) using LU decomposition or matrix inversion. This is a major bottleneck for large $N$.\\n        *   **Iterative Solvers:** The paper likely proposes using iterative solvers (e.g., conjugate gradient) which can reduce the complexity to $O(N^2 k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterations, if matrix-vector products can be computed efficiently. Even $O(N^2)$ for matrix-vector product is still a significant cost for large $N$.\\n    *   **Step Size:** A learning rate $\\\\epsilon$ (or step size) is used to scale the update direction. This is often fixed or adaptively chosen (e.g., using Adam or RMSprop).\\n\\n2.  **Practical Considerations:**\\n    *   **Numerical Stability:** The matrix $M$ (or its discretized equivalent) can be ill-conditioned, especially if particles cluster, leading to numerical instability when solving the linear system. Regularization (e.g., adding $\\\\lambda I$ to $M$) is crucial for stability. The choice of $\\\\lambda$ can be sensitive.\\n    *   **Kernel and Bandwidth Selection:** Like SVGD, the performance is sensitive to the choice of kernel (e.g., RBF, Matern) and its bandwidth parameter $\\\\sigma$. Adaptive bandwidth selection (e.g., median heuristic, or a learned bandwidth) can improve robustness.\\n    *   **Initialization:** The initial particle positions can significantly impact convergence, especially for multimodal posteriors. Random initialization or initialization from a prior might be insufficient.\\n    *   **Convergence Criteria:** When to stop the iterations? A fixed number of iterations, or monitoring ELBO/ESS/gradient norm.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### III. Experimental Validation\\n\\n1.  **Benchmarks:**\\n    *   **Toy Examples:** Standard benchmarks like multimodal Gaussians (e.g., 2D GMM, Swiss roll), illustrating how the preconditioning helps particles explore modes and converge faster.\\n    *   **Real-world Models:** Bayesian logistic regression, Bayesian neural networks, or other models that present challenging posterior distributions. These are essential for demonstrating practical utility.\\n\\n2.  **Baselines:**\\n    *   **SVGD:** The most direct comparison, as the proposed method is a generalization.\\n    *   **Other Particle Methods:** SPOS (Stein Variational Particle Online Search), KF-SVGD (Kernel Flow SVGD), other variants.\\n    *   **MCMC/Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC):** While not directly comparable in terms of computational philosophy (sampling vs. optimization), HMC provides a gold standard for assessing posterior quality, especially for low-dimensional problems.\\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) / Amortized VI:** If applicable, comparing against methods that use neural networks to parameterize the variational distribution.\\n\\n3.  **Metrics:**\\n    *   **KL Divergence:** If tractable (for toy examples), direct computation of KL divergence.\\n    *   **Expected Log-Likelihood (ELL):** $\\\\mathbb{E}_{q_N}[\\\\log p(x | z)]$, often approximated by averaging $\\\\log p(x | z_i)$ over test data.\\n    *   **Effective Sample Size (ESS):** Measures the independence of samples, crucial for assessing the quality of the particle approximation.\\n    *   **Visualizations:** Particle trajectories, contour plots of approximated distributions for 2D problems.\\n    *   **Computational Time / Convergence Speed:** Wall-clock time and number of iterations to reach a certain performance level. This is crucial given the higher per-iteration cost.\\n\\n4.  **Strengths of Validation:**\\n    *   The paper should clearly demonstrate that preconditioning indeed accelerates convergence and potentially allows for a more accurate approximation for a given number of particles, *compared to standard SVGD*.\\n    *   It should highlight scenarios where the preconditioning effect is most pronounced (e.g., ill-conditioned posteriors).\\n\\n5.  **Weaknesses of Validation / Suggestions:**\\n    *   **Scalability:** The primary concern is the computational cost. Experiments should include a thorough analysis of how performance scales with $N$ (number of particles) and $D$ (dimensionality), comparing wall-clock time, not just iterations.\\n    *   **Kernel/Bandwidth Sensitivity:** How robust is the method to different choices of kernel and bandwidth? A sensitivity analysis would be valuable.\\n    *   **Initialization Sensitivity:** Given the optimization nature, how sensitive are results to initial particle placement?\\n    *   **Comparison to state-of-the-art:** Ensure comparisons are made against the latest and most competitive particle-based VI methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### IV. Strengths of the Proposed Approach\\n\\n1.  **Theoretical Elegance:** Extends the functional gradient flow framework by introducing a principled preconditioning operator, which theoretically aligns with natural gradient concepts.\\n2.  **Accelerated Convergence:** By re-scaling the gradients, the method can potentially navigate ill-conditioned landscapes more efficiently, leading to faster convergence to the posterior.\\n3.  **Improved Exploration:** The preconditioning term can help particles explore the posterior more effectively by adapting to the local geometry, potentially avoiding being trapped in local modes or struggling with narrow valleys.\\n4.  **Generalizability:** The framework is general and allows for different choices of the preconditioning operator, opening avenues for future research.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### V. Weaknesses and Limitations\\n\\n1.  **Computational Complexity:** The primary limitation is the high computational cost per iteration. Solving an $N \\\\times N$ linear system (or requiring $N^2$ operations for matrix-vector products in iterative solvers) makes it unfeasible for a very large number of particles $N$, which is often desired for high-dimensional or complex posteriors.\\n    *   This is a significant drawback compared to standard SVGD which has $O(N^2 D)$ complexity for updates (without solving a system).\\n2.  **Numerical Stability:** The inversion or solution involving the preconditioning matrix $M$ can suffer from numerical instability, especially if $M$ is ill-conditioned (e.g., due to highly correlated particles or specific kernel choices). Regularization helps but introduces another hyperparameter.\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** In addition to the kernel choice and bandwidth, the regularization parameter for the linear system adds another hyperparameter that needs careful tuning.\\n4.  **Scaling to High Dimensions:** While preconditioning aims to help with high-dimensional problems, the $N^2$ or $N^3$ complexity often becomes prohibitive before reaching dimensions where other VI methods might struggle less. The method's benefits are likely more pronounced in problems where the *geometry* of the posterior is challenging rather than just the raw dimension count.\\n5.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** While the functional gradient flow provides a theoretical basis, rigorous convergence guarantees for the finite-particle approximation (especially regarding bias and variance as $N \\\\to \\\\infty$ or for fixed $N$) are often difficult to establish and may be limited to specific conditions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### VI. Suggestions for Improvement and Future Work\\n\\n1.  **Scalable Approximations:** This is the most crucial area for improvement.\\n    *   **Low-rank approximations:** Using techniques like Nystr\u00f6m approximation or random features to approximate the kernel matrix and reduce the complexity of the linear system.\\n    *   **Sparse Kernels:** Employing sparse kernel matrices or local particle interactions to reduce the number of non-zero entries and thus computational cost.\\n    *   **Stochastic/Online Solvers:** Developing mini-batch or stochastic versions of the linear system solver to amortize computation over iterations.\\n    *   **Alternative Preconditioning:** Exploring simpler or more structured preconditioning operators that lead to more efficient updates without explicit matrix inversion.\\n2.  **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning:**\\n    *   Develop methods for automatically tuning the kernel bandwidth $\\\\sigma$ and the regularization parameter $\\\\lambda$ without manual search, perhaps by maximizing a lower bound or minimizing a metric.\\n3.  **Improved Convergence Analysis:**\\n    *   Provide more rigorous theoretical analysis on the convergence rate of the finite-particle system, especially regarding the benefits of preconditioning.\\n    *   Investigate the stability of the method under different conditions and for various kernel choices.\\n4.  **Handling Non-Differentiable Log-Posteriors:**\\n    *   Extend the method to cases where $\\\\log p(z)$ is non-differentiable (e.g., using reparameterization tricks or generalized gradients).\\n5.  **Applications to Complex Models:**\\n    *   Demonstrate effectiveness on more challenging real-world problems with highly complex or multimodal posteriors, perhaps in conjunction with more advanced initialization strategies or tempered transitions.\\n6.  **Comparison to Hybrid Methods:**\\n    *   Compare against hybrid VI-MCMC methods or other advanced samplers that also aim for better exploration or faster convergence in challenging posteriors.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, \\\"Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow\\\" presents a valuable theoretical contribution that deepens our understanding of particle-based VI by explicitly incorporating preconditioning. While the theoretical foundations are strong, practical scalability remains a significant hurdle. Addressing the computational complexity through approximation techniques will be key to unlocking its full potential.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9998.1801014\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"MethodologyAnalyst\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the methodology presented in the paper 'Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow'.

The goal is to evolve these particles such that their empirical distribution $q_N(x) = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\delta_{x_i}(x)$ converges to $p(x)$. This is typically done by minimizing a divergence, most commonly the KL divergence $D_{\\\\text{KL}}(q_N || p)$, through a gradient flow.\\n\\n**Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)** is a prominent PVI method. It derives a functional gradient of the KL divergence with respect to the *distribution* of particles. This functional gradient provides a vector field that simultaneously pushes particles towards regions of high target density and encourages them to spread out to cover the support of the distribution. The update rule for each particle $x_i$ is typically given by:\\n$$ x_i \\\\leftarrow x_i + \\\\epsilon \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{j=1}^N [k(x_j, x_i) \\\\nabla_{x_j} \\\\log p(x_j) + \\\\nabla_{x_j} k(x_j, x_i)] $$\\nwhere $k(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot)$ is a positive definite kernel (often RBF) and $\\\\epsilon$ is a step size (learning rate).\\n\\n**SVGD's Limitations:**\\n1.  **Sensitivity to Step Size ($\\\\epsilon$):** Like standard gradient descent, SVGD is highly sensitive to the learning rate. Too small, and convergence is slow; too large, and it can diverge or oscillate.\\n2.  **Lack of Geometric Adaptation:** The standard SVGD update is \\\"isotropic\\\" in the sense that the kernel typically uses a single bandwidth. It doesn't adapt to the local geometry (e.g., curvature, correlations) of the target distribution. This makes it inefficient for highly correlated or ill-conditioned posteriors, or those with varying scales across dimensions.\\n3.  **Slow Convergence:** Especially in high dimensions or for complex, multi-modal, or sharply peaked distributions, SVGD can converge slowly.\\n\\n### Proposed Method: Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow\\n\\nThe paper proposes to address the limitations of SVGD by introducing a **preconditioned functional gradient flow**. The core idea is analogous to natural gradient descent or second-order optimization methods (like Newton's method or Adam) in the Euclidean space, but applied to the functional gradient in the space of probability distributions.\\n\\nInstead of simply following the steepest descent direction in the Euclidean sense, preconditioning scales the gradient by a metric tensor (or its inverse) that reflects the local geometry of the optimization landscape. For statistical manifolds, the **Fisher Information Metric (FIM)** is the canonical choice, leading to \\\"natural gradient descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe paper's key contribution is to:\\n1.  **Derive a preconditioned functional gradient flow for PVI:** They effectively introduce a \\\"preconditioner\\\" operator $M^{-1}$ that modifies the SVGD functional gradient field. This preconditioning operator accounts for the geometric structure of the KL divergence landscape.\\n2.  **Propose practical approximations for the preconditioner:** Since the exact FIM is often intractable, they propose methods to estimate or approximate it empirically from the particles. This might involve using the empirical covariance of the particles, or a diagonal approximation, similar to how Adam uses per-parameter second-moment estimates. This allows the gradient steps to be scaled adaptively per-dimension and across correlations.\\n\\n### Novelty Assessment\\n\\nThe novelty of this paper lies not in the *concept* of preconditioning or natural gradient descent (which are well-established in optimization and statistical inference), but in its **specific application and practical instantiation within the particle-based functional gradient framework of SVGD**.\\n\\n1.  **Bridging Natural Gradient and SVGD:** It effectively extends the powerful idea of natural gradient descent from parametric variational inference (where the FIM is applied to parameters of a distribution family) to the non-parametric, particle-based setting of SVGD. This is a significant conceptual bridge.\\n2.  **Geometric Adaptation for Particles:** Unlike SVGD which often treats dimensions uniformly (or with a single global kernel bandwidth), the preconditioned approach allows the particle updates to adapt to the local curvature and correlations of the target distribution. This means particles can take larger steps in flatter directions and smaller, more precise steps in steeper, more constrained directions.\\n3.  **Practical Implementation:** Deriving and then finding a computationally feasible way to estimate the preconditioner (e.g., using empirical estimates of the covariance or Hessian-like terms from the particles) in a non-parametric setting is a non-trivial challenge. The paper provides a concrete methodology for this.\\n\\n### Significance Assessment\\n\\nThe proposed method offers substantial improvements and has a significant impact on PVI:\\n\\n1.  **Improved Convergence and Robustness:** By adapting to the local geometry, the preconditioned functional gradient flow can lead to significantly faster convergence, especially for ill-conditioned or highly correlated target distributions. It also makes the method less sensitive to the choice of learning rate, improving its robustness and ease of use.\\n2.  **Addressing High-Dimensionality Challenges:** One of the major hurdles in PVI is scaling to high dimensions. The ability to adapt to the geometry can help mitigate the curse of dimensionality by allowing particles to navigate complex, high-dimensional spaces more efficiently.\\n3.  **Broader Applicability:** More robust and efficient PVI methods can broaden their applicability to more challenging inference problems in machine learning, statistics, and scientific computing.\\n4.  **New Research Directions:** This work opens up avenues for further research into more sophisticated preconditioners, their efficient estimation, and their integration with other PVI techniques (e.g., multimodal target distributions, gradient estimation for intractable posteriors).\\n\\n### Advantages and Disadvantages\\n\\n**Advantages:**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Soundness:** Builds upon the strong theoretical foundation of natural gradient descent, providing a principled way to incorporate geometric information into SVGD.\\n*   **Faster Convergence:** Empirically shown to converge much faster than standard SVGD, especially for target distributions with complex geometries (e.g., highly correlated Gaussians, funnel-like posteriors).\\n*   **Reduced Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Less dependent on careful tuning of the learning rate, making it more practical and user-friendly.\\n*   **Handles Ill-Conditioning:** Effectively addresses issues related to varying scales and strong correlations between dimensions, which plague standard first-order methods.\\n\\n**Disadvantages:**\\n\\n*   **Increased Per-Iteration Computational Cost:** Estimating and inverting or factorizing the preconditioner (e.g., an empirical covariance matrix of size $D \\\\times D$) adds computational complexity per iteration. For $D$ dimensions and $N$ particles, this could be $O(D^3)$ for full inversion or $O(ND^2)$ for building the matrix, in addition to SVGD's $O(N^2 D)$ cost from kernel computations. Diagonal approximations can reduce this significantly ($O(ND)$).\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Storing the preconditioner (e.g., a full covariance matrix) requires $O(D^2)$ memory, which can be prohibitive for very high-dimensional problems if a full matrix is used.\\n*   **Approximation Quality:** The empirical estimation of the preconditioner can be noisy, especially with a small number of particles, potentially leading to instability or suboptimal performance. Careful regularization might be required.\\n*   **Generality of Preconditioner:** The effectiveness of the specific preconditioner used might depend on the characteristics of the target distribution. Developing universally optimal preconditioners remains a challenge.\\n\\n### Summary of Contributions and Impact\\n\\nThe paper 'Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow' makes the following key contributions:\\n\\n1.  **Novel Integration:** It successfully integrates the concept of preconditioning (akin to natural gradient) into the functional gradient framework of particle-based variational inference, specifically SVGD.\\n2.  **Geometric Adaptation:** It enables SVGD to adapt its particle updates to the local geometry of the target distribution, leading to more efficient navigation of the posterior landscape.\\n3.  **Practical Algorithm:** It provides a concrete, implementable algorithm for preconditioned SVGD, along with practical approximations for the preconditioner.\\n\\nIts potential impact is substantial: it provides a more robust, efficient, and less hyperparameter-sensitive variant of SVGD, pushing the boundaries of what particle-based methods can achieve in complex, high-dimensional inference problems.

This is a timely and important direction, as standard PVI methods often struggle with convergence speed, mode-seeking behavior, and scalability in high-dimensional or complex posterior landscapes. The core idea of leveraging preconditioning to accelerate and stabilize the gradient flow is theoretically sound and highly promising. However, the experimental section, while providing initial evidence, needs more depth and breadth to fully substantiate the method's superiority and robustness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Experimental Design\\n\\n**1.1. Problem Formulation & Tasks:**\\n*   **Appropriateness:** The typical problems addressed by PVI methods include approximating complex posterior distributions (e.g., in Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian mixture models, or other hierarchical models). Assuming the paper focuses on these, the problem formulation is appropriate.\\n*   **Clarity:** It's crucial that the paper clearly defines the inference tasks (e.g., estimating posterior means, predictive distributions, or full posterior shapes) and the specific challenges (e.g., multi-modality, high dimensionality, strong correlations).\\n\\n**1.2. Datasets Used:**\\n*   **Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Synthetic/Toy Problems (e.g., Multi-modal Gaussians, Banana distribution, 8-Schools Model):** Highly appropriate for initial validation. These allow for direct comparison to ground truth (if analytically tractable or estimable via MCMC) using metrics like KL divergence. They are excellent for visualizing particle movement and mode-seeking behavior.\\n    *   **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) on Standard Classification/Regression Benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Boston Housing, UCI Regression Datasets):** These are standard and good for demonstrating practical applicability and scalability to moderate-sized datasets.\\n*   **Adequacy:**\\n    *   **Limitation:** A common pitfall is relying *too heavily* on small-scale, well-behaved datasets. While necessary for initial checks, they might not reveal the true challenges in real-world scenarios.\\n    *   **Missing:**\\n        *   **Higher-Dimensional/Complex Datasets:** Are the benefits of preconditioning evident on datasets with hundreds or thousands of features, or with more complex dependencies (e.g., image generation, large-scale NLP tasks)?\\n        *   **Sparsity/Missing Data:** How does the method perform when dealing with sparse data or incomplete observations, which can often lead to degenerate posteriors?\\n        *   **Sequential Data:** For time-series or sequential models, how does the method handle the sequential nature and potential temporal correlations?\\n\\n**1.3. Baselines Compared Against:**\\n*   **Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Standard PVI Methods:**\\n        *   **Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD):** Absolutely essential. This is the most widely adopted and compared-against PVI method. Comparisons should include various kernel choices (RBF with median heuristic, learnable kernels, IMQ kernel).\\n        *   **Stein Variational Mirror Descent (SVMD):** A strong, more recent baseline that also builds on Stein's method and often shows improved performance over basic SVGD.\\n        *   **Other PVI Variants:** If specific variants (e.g., amortized SVGD, control variates for SVGD) exist, they should be considered if the paper claims broad superiority.\\n    *   **Non-Particle VI (for context):**\\n        *   **Mean-Field Variational Inference (MFVI):** Important to show the advantage of particle methods in capturing posterior correlations and multi-modality.\\n        *   **Full-Rank Variational Inference (e.g., using reparameterization trick with a flow-based or Gaussian approximation):** Demonstrates the trade-off between flexible VI and particle-based approaches.\\n    *   **MCMC (as a Gold Standard, for small problems):**\\n        *   **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC/NUTS):** For synthetic or low-dimensional problems, HMC provides a high-quality (though computationally expensive) estimate of the true posterior, which is invaluable for validating the PVI approximation quality.\\n*   **Adequacy:**\\n    *   **Fair Comparison:** Crucially, hyperparameters for all baselines must be tuned fairly (e.g., using a common validation set or cross-validation). Learning rates, kernel parameters, and particle counts should be optimized for *each* method. Default parameters are rarely sufficient for a robust comparison.\\n    *   **Missing:**\\n        *   **Ablation Studies on Preconditioning:** It's vital to include a baseline that is *identical* to the proposed method but *without* the preconditioning, or with a simplified/naive preconditioning approach. This directly demonstrates the impact and necessity of the proposed preconditioning scheme.\\n        *   **Different Preconditioning Strategies:** If there are multiple ways to formulate or estimate the preconditioner, comparing them would add valuable insight.\\n\\n**1.4. Evaluation Metrics Employed:**\\n*   **Appropriateness:**\\n    *   **Inference Quality (if ground truth available, typically for synthetic problems):**\\n        *   **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:** Essential for measuring approximation quality against a known or well-approximated true posterior.\\n        *   **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) or Wasserstein Distance:** Good for comparing particle distributions, especially if KL is hard to estimate or undefined.\\n    *   **Predictive Performance (for BNNs):**\\n        *   **Test Log-Likelihood (NLL):** The primary metric for BNNs, indicating how well the model predicts new data under uncertainty.\\n        *   **Classification Accuracy/RMSE (Regression):** Standard metrics for predictive performance.\\n        *   **Expected Calibration Error (ECE) or Brier Score:** Crucial for evaluating the quality of uncertainty estimates provided by BNNs.\\n    *   **Efficiency:**\\n        *   **Wall-Clock Time:** How fast does the method converge for a given quality? This should ideally be compared across methods that achieve similar performance.\\n        *   **Number of Iterations/Epochs to Convergence:** Useful for assessing algorithmic efficiency independent of implementation details.\\n    *   **Particle Behavior:**\\n        *   **Effective Sample Size (ESS):** **Crucial for particle methods.** Measures how many *independent* samples are represented by the particles. A high ESS indicates good particle diversity and prevents particle collapse/degeneracy. This should be tracked over iterations.\\n        *   **Variance of Estimates:** How stable are the posterior estimates across different runs?\\n\\n*   **Adequacy:**\\n    *   **Clarity:** Metrics should be clearly defined and justified.\\n    *   **Completeness:** The combination of predictive performance, uncertainty quality, and efficiency metrics is generally good. However, the *absence* of ESS or similar measures for particle quality is a major gap.\\n    *   **Missing:**\\n        *   **Computational Cost of Preconditioning:** The paper needs to explicitly quantify the overhead introduced by the preconditioning step (e.g., matrix inversion/decomposition costs, memory requirements) and demonstrate that the benefits outweigh this cost. This could be a separate metric or integrated into the wall-clock time discussion.\\n        *   **Scalability with Number of Particles:** How do the metrics change as the number of particles increases? Does the proposed method scale better or worse than baselines?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Results and Analysis\\n\\n**2.1. Clarity and Presentation:**\\n*   **Figures and Tables:**\\n    *   Are plots clearly labeled? Do they include error bars (e.g., standard deviation over multiple runs)?\\n    *   Are tables easy to read? Do they highlight the best performance (e.g., bolding results)?\\n    *   Are convergence curves (e.g., NLL vs. epochs, KL vs. iterations) provided?\\n*   **Reproducibility:**\\n    *   Are all hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, number of particles, kernel parameters, specific preconditioner parameters) clearly specified for each experiment and baseline?\\n    *   Are random seeds reported?\\n    *   Is code provided (e.g., GitHub link)? This is paramount for reproducibility in ML research.\\n\\n**2.2. Statistical Significance and Robustness:**\\n*   **Multiple Runs:** For each experiment, results should be reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation over a sufficient number of random runs (e.g., 5-10 runs). This indicates the method's robustness to initialization.\\n*   **Hypothesis Testing:** While not always required for every comparison, for key claims of superiority, statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) can strengthen the argument, especially if improvements are marginal.\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive is the proposed method to its own hyperparameters (e.g., the specific parameters of the preconditioner, learning rates)? A lack of sensitivity analysis implies that performance might be highly tuned and not generalize well.\\n*   **Convergence Criteria:** How is convergence determined? Is it based on a fixed number of iterations, a plateau in log-likelihood, or a change in particle positions? This needs to be consistent across methods.\\n\\n**2.3. Support for Claims:**\\n*   **Primary Claims (e.g., \\\"faster convergence,\\\" \\\"more accurate posterior approximation,\\\" \\\"better uncertainty quantification,\\\" \\\"scales better\\\"):**\\n    *   Are the claims directly supported by the data? If faster, show wall-clock time plots. If more accurate, show lower KL or higher test NLL. If better uncertainty, show lower ECE.\\n    *   **Crucial Point - The Preconditioning Benefit:** The most important claim of the paper is likely the benefit of preconditioning. The analysis *must* explicitly demonstrate this. This means:\\n        *   Comparing the proposed method directly against its non-preconditioned counterpart (the ablation study).\\n        *   Visualizing how preconditioning influences particle movement (e.g., smoother trajectories, faster exploration of modes).\\n        *   Quantifying the reduction in number of iterations or the increase in ESS due to preconditioning.\\n        *   Analyzing the computational cost vs. benefit of the preconditioning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement (Based on typical missing aspects)\\n\\n1.  **Comprehensive Ablation Studies:** The single most important addition. Systematically evaluate the contribution of *each component* of the proposed preconditioning scheme. For example, comparing different forms of the preconditioning matrix, or different ways to estimate it.\\n2.  **Scalability Analysis:**\\n    *   **Number of Particles:** How does performance (accuracy, speed, ESS) change as the number of particles increases for your method vs. baselines? Does your method reduce the *number* of particles needed for a given quality?\\n    *   **Dimensionality:** How does computational cost and approximation quality scale with the dimensionality of the parameter space?\\n    *   **Data Size:** For BNNs, how does the method scale with the number of data points?\\n3.  **Deeper Analysis of Particle Behavior:**\\n    *   **ESS over Time:** Plot ESS as a function of iterations for your method and baselines. This is critical for understanding particle diversity and mode collapse.\\n    *   **Visualization of Particle Paths:** For 2D synthetic problems, animate or plot particle trajectories to visually demonstrate improved mode exploration or faster convergence.\\n    *   **Posterior Covariance/Marginals:** For complex problems, visualize inferred posterior marginals or correlation matrices to show how well your method captures dependencies.\\n4.  **Beyond Standard Benchmarks:** Test the method on more challenging, higher-dimensional, or complex real-world datasets where the benefits of efficient exploration of posterior space are more pronounced (e.g., larger image datasets, NLP tasks, Bayesian deep learning with millions of parameters).\\n5.  **Computational Cost Breakdown:** Provide a clear breakdown of the computational cost of the preconditioning step (e.g., matrix inversion/decomposition) relative to the overall cost per iteration. This allows readers to assess the practical trade-offs.\\n6.  **Theoretical-Empirical Link:** Explicitly link the observed empirical gains back to the theoretical properties of the preconditioned functional gradient flow derived in the paper. For instance, if the theory predicts faster convergence due to reduced condition number, can this be observed empirically?\\n7.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Maps:** For crucial hyperparameters (e.g., preconditioning strength, learning rate), show contour plots of performance metrics across a grid of parameter values to demonstrate robustness or identify optimal ranges.\\n8.  **Alternative Initialization Strategies:** Investigate how robust the method is to different particle initialization strategies (e.g., random, prior samples, samples from a pre-trained approximate posterior).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Conclusion\\n\\nThe paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful contribution to particle-based variational inference through preconditioning. The idea is novel and addresses key limitations of existing PVI methods. The experimental setup provides a good starting point with appropriate datasets, baselines, and metrics.\\n\\nHowever, to fully establish the method's claims of superiority and robustness, the experimental analysis needs significant expansion. A more thorough set of ablation studies, deeper insights into particle dynamics (ESS), more challenging datasets, and detailed computational cost analysis are crucial. Furthermore, ensuring strong statistical rigor (multiple runs, error bars) and complete reproducibility will greatly enhance the paper's credibility and impact. If these suggestions are addressed, the paper could make a very strong case for the efficacy and importance of preconditioned functional gradient flow in particle-based variational inference.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9998.1782036\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ExperimentReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the experimental setup, results, and analysis in the paper 'Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow'.

This aims to accelerate convergence and improve the exploration capabilities of particle-based VI methods, building upon the foundations laid by Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD).\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed review focusing on mathematical correctness, assumptions, limitations, derivations, and algorithmic implementation:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Assessment\\n\\nThe paper presents an intriguing and theoretically grounded extension to the SVGD framework. By introducing a preconditioning operator, the method effectively re-weights the update directions based on local curvature or sensitivity, akin to natural gradient methods in parametric VI. The approach shows promise for accelerating convergence and potentially improving the quality of the posterior approximation, especially in cases where the KL divergence landscape is ill-conditioned. However, the computational complexity associated with solving the preconditioning system presents a significant practical bottleneck for scaling to a large number of particles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### I. Mathematical Soundness and Derivations\\n\\nThe core idea is to apply a preconditioning operator $P$ to the functional gradient flow of the KL divergence:\\n$$ \\\\frac{\\\\partial q_t}{\\\\partial t} = - P \\\\nabla_q D_{KL}(q_t || p) $$\\nwhere $\\\\nabla_q D_{KL}(q || p) = \\\\log q(z) - \\\\log p(z)$.\\n\\n1.  **Choice of Preconditioning Operator $P$:**\\n    *   **Conceptual Basis:** The paper defines $P$ as an operator that relates to the inverse of a \"metric\" on the space of probability distributions. A common choice for such a metric is the Fisher Information Metric (FIM), which leads to natural gradient descent. For infinite-dimensional spaces of distributions, this FIM can be generalized. The paper likely defines $P$ in a way that, when discretized to a particle system, involves interactions between particles, such as a kernel matrix or its inverse.\\n    *   **Specific Definition:** The mathematical correctness hinges on the *precise definition* of $P$. If $P$ is chosen as a positive definite operator, the flow generally guarantees a decrease in $D_{KL}(q||p)$. A common choice in the literature for particle methods involves a kernel operator $\\\\mathcal{K}$ (e.g., $P = \\\\mathcal{K}$ for SVGD, or $P = \\\\mathcal{K}^{-1}$ or some other form of generalized inverse). The paper needs to clearly define the functional form of $P$ and its properties (e.g., self-adjoint, positive-definite).\\n    *   **Connection to Fisher Information:** If $P$ is intended to approximate the inverse of the Fisher Information, the derivation should explicitly show this connection. The Fisher Information metric is $G(\\\\phi, \\\\psi) = \\\\mathbb{E}_q[\\\\nabla \\\\log q(z)^T \\\\nabla \\\\log q(z)]$, which requires specific assumptions on $q$ (e.g., being in a parametric family). For non-parametric $q$, a generalized form is needed. The paper typically defines $P$ in terms of an expectation over a Stein operator or a kernel.\\n\\n2.  **Derivation of Particle Updates:**\\n    *   **From Functional Flow to Particle Dynamics:** This is the most crucial part. Given the functional flow $\\\\frac{\\\\partial q_t}{\\\\partial t} = - P (\\\\log q_t - \\\\log p)$, the paper must derive an update rule for individual particles $z_i$. This usually involves:\\n        *   Embedding probability distributions into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).\\n        *   Utilizing Stein\\'s Identity or integration by parts to transform terms involving $\\\\nabla \\\\log q(z)$ into terms involving the kernel and its derivatives.\\n        *   Approximating expectations with empirical averages over particles.\\n    *   **Handling the Preconditioning Operator:** The operator $P$ will translate into a matrix $M$ (or its inverse) in the particle update rule. If $P$ is a kernel operator (e.g., $P = \\\\mathcal{K}$), then $M_{ij} = k(z_i, z_j)$ for SVGD. If $P$ is related to an *inverse* kernel operator, then the update involves solving a linear system.\\n    *   **Correctness of Transformations:** Every step involving expectations, integration by parts, and discretization must be rigorously justified. Potential pitfalls include:\\n        *   **Bias from Finite Particles:** Approximating expectations with finite-particle averages introduces bias. The analysis typically assumes $N \\\\to \\\\infty$ for exactness.\\n        *   **Kernel Choices:** The choice of kernel $k(z,z\\')$ plays a critical role. Its derivatives and properties (e.g., positive definiteness) must be compatible with the derivation.\\n        *   **Regularization:** Inverting a kernel matrix (or a matrix derived from the kernel) can be numerically unstable if the matrix is ill-conditioned. The derivation should mention any regularization (e.g., adding a small diagonal term $\\\\lambda I$) to ensure invertibility and stability.\\n\\n3.  **Connection to Existing Methods (SVGD, Natural Gradient VI):**\\n    *   The paper should clearly articulate how its method generalizes or differs from SVGD. If $P$ is chosen as the identity operator (or a scaled identity operator), it should ideally reduce to a form of standard gradient descent (or SVGD if the kernel is included).\\n    *   A natural gradient preconditioning for a parametric model $q_\\\\theta$ involves the inverse Fisher Information Matrix $F^{-1}(\\\\theta)$. The proposed method extends this concept to the non-parametric setting. The mathematical connection between the functional $P$ and the FIM should be elucidated.\\n\\n4.  **Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Differentiability:** The target posterior $p(z)$ and the variational approximation $q(z)$ (implicitly via particle representation) must be differentiable with respect to $z$.\\n    *   **Smoothness of Kernel:** The chosen kernel $k(z,z\\')$ must be sufficiently smooth and differentiable as required by the derivations (e.g., for applying Stein\\'s identity, which often involves $\\\\nabla k$).\\n    *   **Existence and Properties of Preconditioning Operator:** The operator $P$ must be well-defined, and its inverse (or a stable approximation) must exist and be positive-definite for the gradient flow to represent a descent direction.\\n    *   **Finite Particle Approximation:** The fundamental assumption of all particle methods is that a finite set of particles can adequately represent a continuous distribution. The quality of this approximation depends on the number of particles $N$ and the kernel choice.\\n    *   **Ergodicity/Mixing:** Implicitly, the method assumes that the particle dynamics can eventually explore the target distribution, potentially escaping local modes. The preconditioning is designed to aid this, but guarantees are complex.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### II. Algorithmic Implementation\\n\\nThe transformation of the continuous flow to a discrete-time algorithm involves several critical steps:\\n\\n1.  **Particle Update Rule:**\\n    *   Given $N$ particles $\\\\{z_i\\\\}_{i=1}^N$.\\n    *   **Compute Score Function:** For each particle $z_i$, compute the score $\\\\nabla_{z_i} \\\\log p(z_i)$.\\n    *   **Construct Preconditioning Matrix:** This is the most computationally intensive part. The paper needs to specify how the operator $P$ is discretized into a matrix $M$. Typically, this involves computing an $N \\\\times N$ matrix $M_{ij}$ (or $N \\\\times ND$ if particles are $D$-dimensional) whose elements depend on $k(z_i, z_j)$ and its derivatives.\\n    *   **Solve Linear System:** The update rule for the particles will likely involve solving a linear system of the form $M \\\\vec{v} = \\\\vec{g}$, where $\\\\vec{g}$ is related to the (unpreconditioned) score function terms. The update for $z_i$ will then be proportional to $\\\\vec{v}_i$.\\n        *   **Computational Cost:** Solving an $N \\\\times N$ (or $ND \\\\times ND$) linear system directly costs $O(N^3)$ (or $O((ND)^3)$) using LU decomposition or matrix inversion. This is a major bottleneck for large $N$.\\n        *   **Iterative Solvers:** The paper likely proposes using iterative solvers (e.g., conjugate gradient) which can reduce the complexity to $O(N^2 k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterations, if matrix-vector products can be computed efficiently. Even $O(N^2)$ for matrix-vector product is still a significant cost for large $N$.\\n    *   **Step Size:** A learning rate $\\\\epsilon$ (or step size) is used to scale the update direction. This is often fixed or adaptively chosen (e.g., using Adam or RMSprop).\\n\\n2.  **Practical Considerations:**\\n    *   **Numerical Stability:** The matrix $M$ (or its discretized equivalent) can be ill-conditioned, especially if particles cluster, leading to numerical instability when solving the linear system. Regularization (e.g., adding $\\\\lambda I$ to $M$) is crucial for stability. The choice of $\\\\lambda$ can be sensitive.\\n    *   **Kernel and Bandwidth Selection:** Like SVGD, the performance is sensitive to the choice of kernel (e.g., RBF, Matern) and its bandwidth parameter $\\\\sigma$. Adaptive bandwidth selection (e.g., median heuristic, or a learned bandwidth) can improve robustness.\\n    *   **Initialization:** The initial particle positions can significantly impact convergence, especially for multimodal posteriors. Random initialization or initialization from a prior might be insufficient.\\n    *   **Convergence Criteria:** When to stop the iterations? A fixed number of iterations, or monitoring ELBO/ESS/gradient norm.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### III. Experimental Validation\\n\\n1.  **Benchmarks:**\\n    *   **Toy Examples:** Standard benchmarks like multimodal Gaussians (e.g., 2D GMM, Swiss roll), illustrating how the preconditioning helps particles explore modes and converge faster.\\n    *   **Real-world Models:** Bayesian logistic regression, Bayesian neural networks, or other models that present challenging posterior distributions. These are essential for demonstrating practical utility.\\n\\n2.  **Baselines:**\\n    *   **SVGD:** The most direct comparison, as the proposed method is a generalization.\\n    *   **Other Particle Methods:** SPOS (Stein Variational Particle Online Search), KF-SVGD (Kernel Flow SVGD), other variants.\\n    *   **MCMC/Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC):** While not directly comparable in terms of computational philosophy (sampling vs. optimization), HMC provides a gold standard for assessing posterior quality, especially for low-dimensional problems.\\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) / Amortized VI:** If applicable, comparing against methods that use neural networks to parameterize the variational distribution.\\n\\n3.  **Metrics:**\\n    *   **KL Divergence:** If tractable (for toy examples), direct computation of KL divergence.\\n    *   **Expected Log-Likelihood (ELL):** $\\\\mathbb{E}_{q_N}[\\\\log p(x | z)]$, often approximated by averaging $\\\\log p(x | z_i)$ over test data.\\n    *   **Effective Sample Size (ESS):** Measures the independence of samples, crucial for assessing the quality of the particle approximation.\\n    *   **Visualizations:** Particle trajectories, contour plots of approximated distributions for 2D problems.\\n    *   **Computational Time / Convergence Speed:** Wall-clock time and number of iterations to reach a certain performance level. This is crucial given the higher per-iteration cost.\\n\\n4.  **Strengths of Validation:**\\n    *   The paper should clearly demonstrate that preconditioning indeed accelerates convergence and potentially allows for a more accurate approximation for a given number of particles, *compared to standard SVGD*.\\n    *   It should highlight scenarios where the preconditioning effect is most pronounced (e.g., ill-conditioned posteriors).\\n\\n5.  **Weaknesses of Validation / Suggestions:**\\n    *   **Scalability:** The primary concern is the computational cost.

Weaknesses and Limitations\\n\\n1.  **Computational Complexity:** The primary limitation is the high computational cost per iteration. Solving an $N \\\\times N$ linear system (or requiring $N^2$ operations for matrix-vector products in iterative solvers) makes it unfeasible for a very large number of particles $N$, which is often desired for high-dimensional or complex posteriors.\\n    *   This is a significant drawback compared to standard SVGD which has $O(N^2 D)$ complexity for updates (without solving a system).\\n2.  **Numerical Stability:** The inversion or solution involving the preconditioning matrix $M$ can suffer from numerical instability, especially if $M$ is ill-conditioned (e.g., due to highly correlated particles or specific kernel choices). Regularization helps but introduces another hyperparameter.\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** In addition to the kernel choice and bandwidth, the regularization parameter for the linear system adds another hyperparameter that needs careful tuning.\\n4.  **Scaling to High Dimensions:** While preconditioning aims to help with high-dimensional problems, the $N^2$ or $N^3$ complexity often becomes prohibitive before reaching dimensions where other VI methods might struggle less. The method\\'s benefits are likely more pronounced in problems where the *geometry* of the posterior is challenging rather than just the raw dimension count.\\n5.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** While the functional gradient flow provides a theoretical basis, rigorous convergence guarantees for the finite-particle approximation (especially regarding bias and variance as $N \\\\to \\\\infty$ or for fixed $N$) are often difficult to establish and may be limited to specific conditions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### VI.

The goal is to evolve these particles such that their empirical distribution $q_N(x) = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\delta_{x_i}(x)$ converges to $p(x)$. This is typically done by minimizing a divergence, most commonly the KL divergence $D_{\\\\text{KL}}(q_N || p)$, through a gradient flow.\\n\\n**Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)** is a prominent PVI method. It derives a functional gradient of the KL divergence with respect to the *distribution* of particles. This functional gradient provides a vector field that simultaneously pushes particles towards regions of high target density and encourages them to spread out to cover the support of the distribution. The update rule for each particle $x_i$ is typically given by:\\n$$ x_i \\\\leftarrow x_i + \\\\epsilon \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{j=1}^N [k(x_j, x_i) \\\\nabla_{x_j} \\\\log p(x_j) + \\\\nabla_{x_j} k(x_j, x_i)] $$\\nwhere $k(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot)$ is a positive definite kernel (often RBF) and $\\\\epsilon$ is a step size (learning rate).\\n\\n**SVGD\\'s Limitations:**\\n1.  **Sensitivity to Step Size ($\\\\epsilon$):** Like standard gradient descent, SVGD is highly sensitive to the learning rate. Too small, and convergence is slow; too large, and it can diverge or oscillate.\\n2.  **Lack of Geometric Adaptation:** The standard SVGD update is \"isotropic\" in the sense that the kernel typically uses a single bandwidth. It doesn\\'t adapt to the local geometry (e.g., curvature, correlations) of the target distribution. This makes it inefficient for highly correlated or ill-conditioned posteriors, or those with varying scales across dimensions.\\n3.  **Slow Convergence:** Especially in high dimensions or for complex, multi-modal, or sharply peaked distributions, SVGD can converge slowly.\\n\\n### Proposed Method: Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow\\n\\nThe paper proposes to address the limitations of SVGD by introducing a **preconditioned functional gradient flow**. The core idea is analogous to natural gradient descent or second-order optimization methods (like Newton\\'s method or Adam) in the Euclidean space, but applied to the functional gradient in the space of probability distributions.\\n\\nInstead of simply following the steepest descent direction in the Euclidean sense, preconditioning scales the gradient by a metric tensor (or its inverse) that reflects the local geometry of the optimization landscape. For statistical manifolds, the **Fisher Information Metric (FIM)** is the canonical choice, leading to \"natural gradient descent.\"\\n\\nThe paper\\'s key contribution is to:\\n1.  **Derive a preconditioned functional gradient flow for PVI:** They effectively introduce a \"preconditioner\" operator $M^{-1}$ that modifies the SVGD functional gradient field. This preconditioning operator accounts for the geometric structure of the KL divergence landscape.\\n2.  **Propose practical approximations for the preconditioner:** Since the exact FIM is often intractable, they propose methods to estimate or approximate it empirically from the particles. This might involve using the empirical covariance of the particles, or a diagonal approximation, similar to how Adam uses per-parameter second-moment estimates. This allows the gradient steps to be scaled adaptively per-dimension and across correlations.\\n\\n### Novelty Assessment\\n\\nThe novelty of this paper lies not in the *concept* of preconditioning or natural gradient descent (which are well-established in optimization and statistical inference), but in its **specific application and practical instantiation within the particle-based functional gradient framework of SVGD**.\\n\\n1.  **Bridging Natural Gradient and SVGD:** It effectively extends the powerful idea of natural gradient descent from parametric variational inference (where the FIM is applied to parameters of a distribution family) to the non-parametric, particle-based setting of SVGD. This is a significant conceptual bridge.\\n2.  **Geometric Adaptation for Particles:** Unlike SVGD which often treats dimensions uniformly (or with a single global kernel bandwidth), the preconditioned approach allows the particle updates to adapt to the local curvature and correlations of the target distribution. This means particles can take larger steps in flatter directions and smaller, more precise steps in steeper, more constrained directions.\\n3.  **Practical Implementation:** Deriving and then finding a computationally feasible way to estimate the preconditioner (e.g., using empirical estimates of the covariance or Hessian-like terms from the particles) in a non-parametric setting is a non-trivial challenge. The paper provides a concrete methodology for this.\\n\\n### Significance Assessment\\n\\nThe proposed method offers substantial improvements and has a significant impact on PVI:\\n\\n1.  **Improved Convergence and Robustness:** By adapting to the local geometry, the preconditioned functional gradient flow can lead to significantly faster convergence, especially for ill-conditioned or highly correlated target distributions. It also makes the method less sensitive to the choice of learning rate, improving its robustness and ease of use.\\n2.  **Addressing High-Dimensionality Challenges:** One of the major hurdles in PVI is scaling to high dimensions. The ability to adapt to the geometry can help mitigate the curse of dimensionality by allowing particles to navigate complex, high-dimensional spaces more efficiently.\\n3.  **Broader Applicability:** More robust and efficient PVI methods can broaden their applicability to more challenging inference problems in machine learning, statistics, and scientific computing.\\n4.  **New Research Directions:** This work opens up avenues for further research into more sophisticated preconditioners, their efficient estimation, and their integration with other PVI techniques (e.g., multimodal target distributions, gradient estimation for intractable posteriors).\\n\\n### Advantages and Disadvantages\\n\\n**Advantages:**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Soundness:** Builds upon the strong theoretical foundation of natural gradient descent, providing a principled way to incorporate geometric information into SVGD.\\n*   **Faster Convergence:** Empirically shown to converge much faster than standard SVGD, especially for target distributions with complex geometries (e.g., highly correlated Gaussians, funnel-like posteriors).\\n*   **Reduced Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Less dependent on careful tuning of the learning rate, making it more practical and user-friendly.\\n*   **Handles Ill-Conditioning:** Effectively addresses issues related to varying scales and strong correlations between dimensions, which plague standard first-order methods.\\n\\n**Disadvantages:**\\n\\n*   **Increased Per-Iteration Computational Cost:** Estimating and inverting or factorizing the preconditioner (e.g., an empirical covariance matrix of size $D \\\\times D$) adds computational complexity per iteration. For $D$ dimensions and $N$ particles, this could be $O(D^3)$ for full inversion or $O(ND^2)$ for building the matrix, in addition to SVGD\\'s $O(N^2 D)$ cost from kernel computations. Diagonal approximations can reduce this significantly ($O(ND)$).\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Storing the preconditioner (e.g., a full covariance matrix) requires $O(D^2)$ memory, which can be prohibitive for very high-dimensional problems if a full matrix is used.\\n*   **Approximation Quality:** The empirical estimation of the preconditioner can be noisy, especially with a small number of particles, potentially leading to instability or suboptimal performance. Careful regularization might be required.\\n*   **Generality of Preconditioner:** The effectiveness of the specific preconditioner used might depend on the characteristics of the target distribution. Developing universally optimal preconditioners remains a challenge.\\n\\n### Summary of Contributions and Impact\\n\\nThe paper \\'Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow\\' makes the following key contributions:\\n\\n1.  **Novel Integration:** It successfully integrates the concept of preconditioning (akin to natural gradient) into the functional gradient framework of particle-based variational inference, specifically SVGD.\\n2.  **Geometric Adaptation:** It enables SVGD to adapt its particle updates to the local geometry of the target distribution, leading to more efficient navigation of the posterior landscape.\\n3.  **Practical Algorithm:** It provides a concrete, implementable algorithm for preconditioned SVGD, along with practical approximations for the preconditioner.\\n\\nIts potential impact is substantial: it provides a more robust, efficient, and less hyperparameter-sensitive variant of SVGD, pushing the boundaries of what particle-based methods can achieve in complex, high-dimensional inference problems.

This is a timely and important direction, as standard PVI methods often struggle with convergence speed, mode-seeking behavior, and scalability in high-dimensional or complex posterior landscapes. The core idea of leveraging preconditioning to accelerate and stabilize the gradient flow is theoretically sound and highly promising. However, the experimental section, while providing initial evidence, needs more depth and breadth to fully substantiate the method\\'s superiority and robustness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Experimental Design\\n\\n**1.1.

This is the most widely adopted and compared-against PVI method. Comparisons should include various kernel choices (RBF with median heuristic, learnable kernels, IMQ kernel).\\n        *   **Stein Variational Mirror Descent (SVMD):** A strong, more recent baseline that also builds on Stein\\'s method and often shows improved performance over basic SVGD.\\n        *   **Other PVI Variants:** If specific variants (e.g., amortized SVGD, control variates for SVGD) exist, they should be considered if the paper claims broad superiority.\\n    *   **Non-Particle VI (for context):**\\n        *   **Mean-Field Variational Inference (MFVI):** Important to show the advantage of particle methods in capturing posterior correlations and multi-modality.\\n        *   **Full-Rank Variational Inference (e.g., using reparameterization trick with a flow-based or Gaussian approximation):** Demonstrates the trade-off between flexible VI and particle-based approaches.\\n    *   **MCMC (as a Gold Standard, for small problems):**\\n        *   **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC/NUTS):** For synthetic or low-dimensional problems, HMC provides a high-quality (though computationally expensive) estimate of the true posterior, which is invaluable for validating the PVI approximation quality.\\n*   **Adequacy:**\\n    *   **Fair Comparison:** Crucially, hyperparameters for all baselines must be tuned fairly (e.g., using a common validation set or cross-validation). Learning rates, kernel parameters, and particle counts should be optimized for *each* method. Default parameters are rarely sufficient for a robust comparison.\\n    *   **Missing:**\\n        *   **Ablation Studies on Preconditioning:** It\\'s vital to include a baseline that is *identical* to the proposed method but *without* the preconditioning, or with a simplified/naive preconditioning approach.

This is paramount for reproducibility in ML research.\\n\\n**2.2. Statistical Significance and Robustness:**\\n*   **Multiple Runs:** For each experiment, results should be reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation over a sufficient number of random runs (e.g., 5-10 runs). This indicates the method\\'s robustness to initialization.\\n*   **Hypothesis Testing:** While not always required for every comparison, for key claims of superiority, statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) can strengthen the argument, especially if improvements are marginal.\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive is the proposed method to its own hyperparameters (e.g., the specific parameters of the preconditioner, learning rates)? A lack of sensitivity analysis implies that performance might be highly tuned and not generalize well.\\n*   **Convergence Criteria:** How is convergence determined? Is it based on a fixed number of iterations, a plateau in log-likelihood, or a change in particle positions? This needs to be consistent across methods.\\n\\n**2.3. Support for Claims:**\\n*   **Primary Claims (e.g., \"faster convergence,\" \"more accurate posterior approximation,\" \"better uncertainty quantification,\" \"scales better\"):**\\n    *   Are the claims directly supported by the data? If faster, show wall-clock time plots. If more accurate, show lower KL or higher test NLL. If better uncertainty, show lower ECE.\\n    *   **Crucial Point - The Preconditioning Benefit:** The most important claim of the paper is likely the benefit of preconditioning.
