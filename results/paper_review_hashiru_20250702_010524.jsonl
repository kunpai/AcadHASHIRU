The paper title is: Learned Index with Dynamic $\\epsilon$\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Data indexing (Graefe & Kuno, 2011; Wang et al., 2018; Luo & Carey, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), which stores keys and corresponding payloads with designed structures, supports efficient query operations over data and benefits various data retrieval applications. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) models have been incorporated into the design of index structure, leading to substantial improvements in terms of both storage space and querying efficiency (Kipf et al., 2019; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020a; Mitzenmacher, 2018; Vaidya et al., 2021). The key insight behind this trending topic of \u201clearned index\u201d is that the data to be indexed contain useful distribution information and such information can be utilized by trainable ML models that map the keys {x} to their stored positions {y}. To approximate the data distribution, state-of-the-art (SOTA) learned index methods (Galakatos et al., 2019; Kipf et al., 2020; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Ferragina et al., 2020; Stoian et al., 2021) propose to learn piece-wise linear segments S = [S1, ..., Si, ..., SN ], where Si : y = aix+ bi is the linear segment parameterized by (ai, bi) and N is the total number of learned segments. These methods introduce an important pre-defined parameter \u03f5 \u2208 Z>1 and adopt the following online learning process: Beginning from the first available data point, the current linear segment adjusts (ai, bi) and covers as many data points as possible until a data point, say (x\u2032, y\u2032) achieves the prediction error |Si(x\u2032)\u2212 y\u2032| > \u03f5. The violation of \u03f5 triggers a new linear segment, and the data point (x\u2032, y\u2032) will be the first available data point. The process repeats until no data point is available and as a result, the worst-case preciseness can be guaranteed with \u03f5. By tuning \u03f5, various space-time preferences from users can be met. For example, a relatively large \u03f5 can result in a small index size while having large prediction errors, and on the other hand, a relatively small \u03f5 provides users with small prediction errors while having more learned segments and thus a large index size. Existing learned index methods implicitly assume that the whole dataset to be indexed contains the same characteristics for different localities and thus adopt the same \u03f5 for all the learned segments. However, the scenario where there is varied local data distribution, is very common, leading to sub-optimal index performance of existing methods. For example, the real-world Weblog dataset used in our experiment has typically non-linear temporal patterns caused by online campus transactions such as class schedule arrangements, weekends and holidays. More importantly, the impact of \u03f5 on index performance is intrinsically linked to data characteristics, which are not fully explored and utilized by existing learned index methods. Motivated by these, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the impact of \u03f5 on index performance, and link the characteristics of data localities with the dynamic adjustments of \u03f5. Based on the derived theoretical results, we propose an efficient and pluggable learned index framework that dynamically adjusts \u03f5 in a principled way. To be specific, under the setting of an illustrative learned index method MET (Ferragina et al., 2020), we present novel analysis about the prediction error bounds of each segment that link \u03f5 with the mean and variance of data localities. The segment-wise prediction error embeds the space-time trade-off as it is the product of the number of covered keys and mean absolute error, which determine the index size and preciseness respectively. The derived mathematical relationships enable our framework to fully explore diverse data localities with an \u03f5-learner module, which learns to predict the impact of \u03f5 on the index performance and adaptively choose a suitable \u03f5 to achieve a better space-time trade-off. We apply the proposed framework to several SOTA learned index methods, and conduct a series of experiments on three widely adopted real-world datasets. Comparing with the original learned index methods with fixed \u03f5, our dynamic \u03f5 versions achieve significant index performance improvements with better space-time trade-offs. We also conduct various experiments to verify the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed framework, and provide both ablation study and case study to understand how the proposed framework works. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We make the first step to exploit the potential of dynamically adjusting \u03f5 for learned indexes, and propose an efficient and pluggable framework that can be applied to a broad class of piece-wise approximation algorithms. \u2022 We provide theoretical analysis for a proxy task modeling the index space-time trade-off, which establishes our \u03f5-learner based on the data characteristics and the derived bounds. \u2022 We achieve significant index performance improvements over several SOTA learned index methods on real-world datasets. To facilitate further studies, we make our codes and datasets public at https://github.com/AnonyResearcher/ICLR-2240. 2 BACKGROUND: Learned Index. Given a dataset D = {(x, y)|x \u2208 X , y \u2208 Y}, X is the set of keys over a universe U such as reals or integers, and Y is the set of positions where the keys and corresponding payloads are stored. The index such as B+-tree (Abel, 1984) aims to build a compact structure to support efficient query operations over D. Typically, the keys are assumed to be sorted in ascending order to satisfy the key-position monotonicity, i.e., for any two keys, xi > xj iff their positions yi > yj , such that the range query (X \u2229 [xlow, xhigh]) can be handled. Recently, learned index methods (Kraska et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Crotty, 2021) leverage ML models to mine useful distribution information from D, and incorporate such information to boost the index performance. To look up a given key x, the learned index first predicts position y\u0302 using the learned models, and subsequently finds the stored true position y based on y\u0302 with a binary search or exponential search. Thus the querying time consists of the inference time of the learned models and the search time in O(log(|y\u0302 \u2212 y|)). By modeling the data distribution information, learned indexes achieve faster query speed than traditional B+-tree index, meanwhile using several orders-of-magnitude smaller storage space (Ding et al., 2020; Galakatos et al., 2019; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Kipf et al., 2020; Marcus et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). \u03f5-bounded Linear Approximation. Many existing learned index methods adopt piece-wise linear segments to approximate the distribution of D due to their effectiveness and low computing cost, and introduce the parameter \u03f5 to provide a worst-case preciseness guarantee and a tunable knob to meet various space-time trade-off preferences. Here we briefly introduce the SOTA \u03f5-bounded learned index methods that are most closely to our work, and refer readers to the literature (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020a; Marcus et al., 2020; Stoian et al., 2021) for details of other methods. We first describe an illustrative learned index algorithm MET (Ferragina et al., 2020). Specifically, for any two consecutive keys ofD, suppose their key interval (xi\u2212xi\u22121) is drawn according to a random process {Gi}i\u2208N, where Gi is a positive independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable whose mean is \u00b5 and variance is \u03c32. MET learns linear segments {Si : y = aix+ bi} via a simple deterministic strategy: the current segment fixes the slope ai = 1/\u00b5, goes through the first available data point and thus bi is determined. Then Si covers the remaining data points one by one until a data point (x\u2032, y\u2032) gains the prediction error larger than \u03f5. The violation triggers a new linear segment that begins from (x\u2032, y\u2032) and the process repeats until D has been traversed. Other \u03f5-bounded learned index methods learn linear segments in a similar manner to MET while having different mechanisms to determine the parameters of {Si}. FITing-Tree (Galakatos et al., 2019) uses a greedy shrinking cone algorithm. PGM (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b) adopts another one-pass algorithm that achieves the optimal number of learned segments. Radix-Spline (Kipf et al., 2020) introduces a radix structure to organize the learned segments. However, existing methods constrain all learned segments with the same \u03f5. All of these piece-wise segments based approaches attempt to improve performance by changing the way segments are learned or organized, but ignore the optimization potential of dynamically varying \u03f5. In this paper, we will discuss the impact of \u03f5 in more depth and investigate how to enhance existing learned index methods from a new perspective: dynamic adjustment of \u03f5 accounting for the diversity of different data localities. Besides, different from (Ferragina et al., 2020) that reveals the relationship between \u03f5 and index size performance based on MET. In Section 3.3, we present novel analysis about the impact of \u03f5 on not only the index size, but also the index preciseness and a comprehensive trade-off quantity, which facilitates the proposed dynamic \u03f5 adjustment. 3 LEARN TO VARY \u03f5 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION AND MOTIVATION: Before introducing the proposed framework, we first formulate the task of learning index from data with \u03f5 guarantee, and provide some discussions about why we need to vary \u03f5. Given a dataset D to be indexed and an \u03f5-bounded learned index algorithm A, we aim to learn linear segments S = [S1, ..., Si..., SN ] with segment-wise varied [\u03f5i]i\u2208[N ], such that a better trade-off between storage cost (size in KB) and query efficiency (time in ns) can be achieved than the ones using fixed \u03f5. Let Di \u2282 D be the data whose keys are covered by Si, for the remaining data D \\ \u22c3 j<iDj , the algorithm A repeatedly checks whether the prediction error of new data point violates the given \u03f5i and outputs the learned segment Si. When all the \u03f5is for i \u2208 [N ] take the same value, the problem becomes the one that existing learned index methods are dealing with. To facilitate theoretical analysis, we focus on two proxy quantities for the target space-time trade-off: (1) the number of learned segments N and (2) the mean absolute prediction error MAE(Di|Si), which is affected and upper-bounded by \u03f5i. We note that the improvements of N -MAE trade-off fairly and adequately reflect the improvements of the space-time trade-off: (1) The learned segments size in bytes and N are positively correlated and only different by a constant factor, e.g., the size of a segment can be 128bit if it consists of two double-precision float parameters (slope and intercept); (2) When using exponential search, the querying complexity is O(log(N) + log(MAE(Di|Si)), in which the first term indicates the finding process of the specific segment S\u2032 that covers the key x for a queried data point (x, y), and the second term indicates the search range |y\u0302 \u2212 y| for true position y based on the estimated one y\u0302 = S\u2032(x). In this paper, we adopt exponential search as search algorithm since it is better than binary search for exploiting the predictive ability of learned models. In Appendix D, we show that the search range of exponential search is O(MAE(Di|Si)), which can be much smaller than the one of binary search, O(\u03f5i), especially for strong predictive models and the datasets having clear linearity. Similar empirical support can be also found from (Ding et al., 2020). Now let\u2019s examine how the parameter \u03f5 affects the N -MAE trade-off. We can see that these two performance terms compete with each other and \u03f5 plays an important role to balance them. If we adopt a small \u03f5, the prediction error constraint is more frequently violated, leading to a large N ; meanwhile, the preciseness of learned index is improved, leading to a small MAE of the whole data MAE(D|S). On the other hand, with a large \u03f5, we will get a more compact learned index (i.e., a small N ) with larger prediction errors (i.e., a large MAE(D|S)). Actually, the effect of \u03f5 on index performance is intrinsically linked to the characteristic of the data to be indexed. For real-world datasets, an important observation is that the linearity degree varies in different data localities. Recall that we use piece-wise linear segments to fit the data, and \u03f5 determines the partition and the fitness of the segments. By varying \u03f5, we can adapt to the local variations of D and adjust the partition such that each learned segment fits the data better. Formally, let\u2019s consider the quantity SegErri that is defined as the total prediction error within a segment Si, i.e., SegErri \u225c \u2211 (x,y)\u2208Di |y \u2212 Si(x)|, which is also the product of the number of covered keys Len(Di) and the mean absolute error MAE(Di|Si). Note that a large Len(Di) leads to a small N since |D| = \u2211N i=1 Len(Di). From this view, the quantity SegErri internally reflects the N -MAE trade-off. Later we will show how to leverage this quantity to dynamically adjust \u03f5. 3.2 OVERALL FRAMEWORK: In practice, it is intractable to directly solve the problem formulated in Section 3.1. With a given \u03f5i, the one-pass algorithm A determines Si and Di until the error bound \u03f5i is violated. In other words, it is unknown what the data partition {Di} will be a priori, which makes it impossible to solve the problem by searching among all the possible {\u03f5i}s and learning index with a set of given {\u03f5i}. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently find an approximate solution to this problem via the introduced \u03f5-learner module. Instead of heuristically adjusting \u03f5, the \u03f5-learner learns to predict the impact of \u03f5 on the index structure and adaptively adjusts \u03f5 in a principled way. Meanwhile, the introducing of \u03f5-learner should not sacrifice the efficiency of the original one-pass learned index algorithms, which is important for real-world practical applications. These two design considerations establish our dynamic \u03f5 framework as shown in Figure 1. The \u03f5-learner is based on an estimation function SegErr = f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) that depicts the mathematical relationships among \u03f5, SegErri and the characteristics \u00b5, \u03c3 of the data to be indexed. As a start, users can provide an expected \u03f5\u0303 that indicates various preferences under space-sensitive or time-sensitive applications. To meet the user requirements, afterwards, we internally transform the \u03f5\u0303 into another proxy quantity \u02dcSegErr, which reflects the expected prediction error for each segment if we set \u03f5i = \u03f5\u0303. This transformation also links the adjustment of \u03f5 and data characteristics together, which enables the data-dependent adjustment of \u03f5. Beginning with \u03f5\u0303, the \u03f5-learner chooses a suitable \u03f5i according to current data characteristics, then learns a segment Si usingA, and finally enhances the \u03f5-learner with the rewarded ground-truth SegErri of each segment. To make the introduced adjustment efficient, we propose to only sample a small Look-ahead data D\u2032 to estimate the characteristics (\u00b5, \u03c3) of the following data locality. The learning process repeats and is also in an efficient one-pass manner. Note that the proposed framework provides users the same interface as the ones used by original learned index methods. That is, we do not add any additional cost to the users\u2019 experience, and users can smoothly and painlessly use our framework with given \u03f5\u0303 just as they use the original methods with given \u03f5. The \u03f5 is an intuitive, meaningful, easy-to-set and method-agnostic quantity for users. On the one hand, we can easily impose restrictions on the worst-case querying cases with \u03f5 as the data accessing number in querying process is O(log(|y\u0302 \u2212 y|)). On the other hand, \u03f5 is easier to estimate than the other quantities such as index size and querying time, which are dependent on specific algorithms, data layouts, implementations and experimental platforms. Our pluggable framework retains the benefits of existing learned index methods, such as the aforementioned usability of \u03f5, and the ability to handle dynamic update case and hard size requirement. 1 We have seen how \u03f5 determines index performance and how SegErri embeds the N -MAE trade-off in Section 3.1. In Section 3.3, we further theoretically analyze the relationship among \u03f5, SegErri, and data characteristics \u00b5, \u03c3 at different localities. Based on the analysis, we elaborate the details of \u03f5-learner and the internal transformation between \u03f5 and SegErri in Section 3.4. 3.3 PREDICTION ERROR ESTIMATION: In this section, we theoretically study the impact of \u03f5 on the prediction error SegErri of each learned segment Si. The derived closed-form relationships will be taken into account in the design of the proposed \u03f5-learner module (Section 3.4). Specifically, for the MET algorithm, we can prove the following theorem to bound the expectation of SegErri with \u03f5 and the key interval distribution of D. 1We discuss how to extend existing works in more details in Appendix E. Theorem 1. Given a dataset D to be indexed and an \u03f5 where \u03f5 \u2208 Z>1, consider the setting of the MET algorithm (Ferragina et al., 2020), in which key intervals ofD are drawn from a random process consisting of positive i.i.d. random variables with mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32, and \u03f5 \u226b \u03c3/\u00b5. For a learned segment Si and its covered data Di, denote SegErri = \u2211 (x,y)\u2208Di |y \u2212 Si(x)|. Then the expectation of SegErri satisfies:\u221a 1 \u03c0 \u00b5 \u03c3 \u03f52 < E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 )2\u03f53. Note that the average length of segments obtained by MET algorithm is (\u00b5\u03c3 ) 2\u03f52. We now get a constant 23 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 \u2248 0.78 that is tighter than the trivial one with 1 corresponding to the case where each data point reaches the largest error \u03f5. This theorem reveals that the prediction error SegErri depends on both \u03f5 and the data characteristics (\u00b5, \u03c3). Recall that CV =\u03c3/\u00b5 is the coefficient of variation, a classical statistical measure of the relative dispersion of data points. In the context of the linear approximation, the data statistic 1/CV = \u00b5/\u03c3 in our bounds intrinsically corresponds to the linearity degree of the data. With this, we can find that when \u00b5/\u03c3 is large, the data is easy-to-fit with linear segments, and thus we can choose a small \u03f5 to achieve precise predictions. On the other hand, when \u00b5/\u03c3 is small, it becomes harder to fit the data using a linear segment, and thus \u03f5 should be increased to absorb some non-linear data localities. In this way, we can make the total prediction error for different learned segments consistent and achieve a better N -MAE trade-off. This analysis also confirms the motivation of varying \u03f5: The local linearity degrees of the indexed data can be diverse, and we should adjust \u03f5 according to the local characteristic of the data, such that the learned index can fit and leverage the data distribution better. In the rest of this section, we provide a proof sketch of this theorem due to the space limitation. For detailed proof, please refer to our Appendix A. \u2022 TRANSFORMED RANDOM WALK. The main idea is to model the learning process of linear approximation with \u03f5 guarantee as a random walk process, and consider that the absolute prediction error of each data point follows folded normal distributions. Specifically, given a learned segment Si : y = aix+ bi, we can calculate the expectation of SegErri for this segment as: E[SegErri] = aiE (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |Zj |  = ai \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n), (1) where Zj is the j-th position of a transformed random walk {Zj}j\u2208N, j\u2217 = max{j \u2208 N| \u2212 \u03f5/ai \u2264 Zj \u2264 \u03f5/ai} is the random variable indicating the maximal position when the random walk is within the strip of boundary \u00b1\u03f5/ai, and the last equality is due to the definition of expectation. \u2022 PROOF OF UPPER BOUND. Under the MET algorithm setting where ai = 1/\u00b5 and \u03f5\u226b \u03c3/\u00b5, we can show that the increments of the transformed random walk {Zj} have zero mean and variance \u03c32, and many steps are necessary to reach the random walk boundary. With the Central Limit Theorem, we can assume the Zj follows normal distribution with mean \u00b5zj = 0 and variance \u03c32zj = j\u03c3 2, and thus |Zj | follows the folded normal distribution with expectation E(|Zj |) = \u221a 2/\u03c0\u03c3 \u221a j. Thus Eq. (1) can be written as 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n)< 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 E [|Zj |]Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j Pr(j\u2217 = n). Using E[j\u2217] = \u00b52 \u03c32 \u03f52 and V ar[j\u2217] = 2 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54 as derived in Ferragina et al. (2020), we get E[(j\u2217)2] = 5 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54. With the inequality \u2211n\u22121 j=0 \u221a j < 23n \u221a n and E[X 34 ] \u2264 (E[X]) 3 4 , we get the upper bound: E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 E[(j\u2217) 3 2 ] \u2264 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 ( E[(j\u2217)2] ) 3 4 = 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 )2\u03f53. \u2022 PROOF OF LOWER BOUND. Applying the triangle inequality into Eq. (1), we can get E[SegErri] > 1\u00b5 \u2211\u221e n=1 E [|Z|] Pr(j\u2217 = n), where Z = \u2211n\u22121 j=0 Zj , and Z follows the normal distribution since Zj \u223c N(0, \u03c32zj). We can prove that |Z| follows the folded normal distribution whose expectation E[|Z|] > \u03c3(n\u2212 1)/ \u221a \u03c0. Thus the lower bound is: E[SegErri] > \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 (n\u2212 1)Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 E [j\u2217 \u2212 1] = \u221a 1 \u03c0 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 \u03f52 \u2212 \u03c3 \u00b5 ). Since \u03f5\u226b \u03c3\u00b5 , we can omit the right term \u221a 1/\u03c0 \u00b7 \u03c3/\u00b5 and finish the proof. Although the derivations are based on the MET algorithm whose slope is the reciprocal of \u00b5, we found that the mathematical forms among \u03f5, \u00b5/\u03c3 and SegErri are still applicable to other \u03f5-bounded methods, and further prove that the learned segment slopes of these methods are similar with bounded difference in Appendix B. 3.4 \u03f5-LEARNER Now given an \u03f5, we have obtained the closed-form bounds of the SegErr in Theorem 1, and both the upper and lower bounds are in the form of w1(\u00b5\u03c3 ) w2\u03f5w3 , where w1,2,3 are some coefficients. As the concrete values of these coefficients can be different for different datasets and different methods, we propose to learn the following trainable estimator to make the error prediction preciser: SegErr = f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) =w1( \u00b5 \u03c3 )w2\u03f5w3 , s.t. \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u2264 w1 \u2264 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 , 1 \u2264 w2 \u2264 2, 2 \u2264 w3 \u2264 3. (2) With this learnable estimator, we feed data characteristic \u00b5/\u03c3 of the look-ahead data and the transformed \u02dcSegErr into it and find a suitable \u03f5\u2217 as ( \u02dcSegErr/w1(\u00b5\u03c3 ) w2 )1/w3 . We will discuss the look-ahead data and the transformed \u02dcSegErr in the following paragraphs. Now let\u2019s discuss the reasons for how this adjustment can achieve better index performance. Actually, the \u03f5-learner proactively plans the allocations of the total prediction error indicated by user (i.e., \u03f5\u0303 \u00b7 |D|) and calculates the tolerated \u02dcSegErr for the next segment. By adjusting current \u03f5 to \u03f5\u2217, the following learned segment can fully utilize the distribution information of the data and achieve better performance in terms of N -MAE trade-off. To be specific, when \u00b5/\u03c3 is large, the local data has clear linearity, and thus we can adjust \u03f5 to a relatively small value to gain precise predictions; although the number of data points covered by this segment may decrease and then the number of total segments increases, such cost paid in terms of space is not larger than the benefit we gain in terms of precise predictions. Similarly, when \u00b5/\u03c3 is small, \u03f5 should be adjusted to a relatively large value to lower the learning difficulty and absorb some non-linear data localities; in this case, we gain in terms of space while paying some costs in terms of prediction accuracy. The segment-wise adjustment of \u03f5 improves the overall index performance by continually and data-dependently balancing the cost of space and preciseness. Look-ahead Data. To make the training and inference of the \u03f5-learner light-weight, we propose to look ahead a few data D\u2032 to reflect the characteristics of the following data localities. Specifically, we leverage a small subset D\u2032 \u2282 D \\ \u22c3 j<iDj to estimate the value \u00b5/\u03c3 for the following data. In practice, we set the size of D\u2032 to be 404 when learning the first segment as initialization, and( 1 (i\u22121) \u2211i\u22121 j=1 Len(Dj) ) \u00b7 \u03c1 for the other following segments. Here \u03c1 is a pre-defined parameter indicating the percentage that is relative to the average number of covered keys for learned segments, considering that the distribution of \u00b5/\u03c3 can be quite different to various datasets. As for the first segment, according to the literature (Kelley, 2007), the sample size 404 can provide a 90% confidence intervals for a coefficient of variance \u03c3/\u00b5 \u2264 0.2. \u02dcSegErr and Optimization. As aforementioned, taking the user-expected \u03f5\u0303 as input, we aim to reflect the impact of \u03f5\u0303 with a transformed proxy quantity \u02dcSegErr such that the \u03f5-learner can choose suitable \u03f5\u2217 to meet users\u2019 preference while achieving better N -MAE trade-off. Specifically, we make the value of \u02dcSegErr updatable, and update it to be \u02dcSegErr = w1(\u00b5\u0302/\u03c3\u0302)w2 \u03f5\u0303w3 once a new segment is learned, where \u00b5\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 is the mean value of all the processed data so far. This strategy enables us to promptly incorporate both the user preference and the data distribution into the calculation of \u02dcSegErr. As for the optimization of the light-weight model, i.e., f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) that contains only three learnable parameters w1,2,3, we adopt the projected gradient descent Calamai & Mor\u00e9 (1987); den Hertog & Roos (1991) with the parameter constraints in Eq. (2). In this way, we only need to track a few statistics and learn the \u03f5 estimator in an efficient one-pass manner. The overall algorithm is summarized in Appendix D. 4 EXPERIMENTS:  4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS: Baselines. We apply our framework into several state-of-the-art \u03f5-bounded learned index methods that use different mechanisms to determine the parameters of segments {Si}. Among them, MET (Ferragina et al., 2020) fixes the segment slope as the reciprocal of the expected key interval. FITingTree (Galakatos et al., 2019) and Radix-Spline (Kipf et al., 2020) adopt a greedy shrinking cone algorithm and a spline interpolating algorithm respectively. PGM (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b) adopts a convex hull based algorithm to achieve the minimum number of learned segments. More introduction and implementation details are in Appendix F. Datasets. We use several widely adopted datasets that are from real-world applications and differ in data scales and distributions (Kraska et al., 2018; Galakatos et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2020; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Li et al., 2021). Weblogs and IoT contain 715M log entries from a university web server and 26M event entries from different IoT sensors respectively, in which the keys are log timestamps. Map dataset contains location coordinates around the world (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017), and the keys are longitudes of 200M places. Lognormal is a synthetic dataset whose key intervals follow the lognormal distribution. We generate 20M keys with 40 partitions having different generation parameters to simulate the varied data characteristics among different localities. More details and visualization are in Appendix G. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the index performance in terms of its size, prediction preciseness, and the total querying time. Specifically, we report the number of learned segments N , the index size in bytes, the MAE as 1|D| \u2211 (x,y)\u2208D |y \u2212 S(x)|, and the total querying time per query in ns (i.e., we perform querying operations for all the indexed data, record the total time of getting the payloads given the keys, and report the time that is averaged over all the queries). For a quantitative comparison w.r.t. the trade-off improvements, we calculate the Area Under the N-MAE Curve (AUNEC) where the x-axis and y-axis indicate N and MAE respectively. For AUNEC metric, the smaller, the better. 4.2 OVERALL INDEX PERFORMANCE: N -MAE Trade-off Improvements. In Table 1, we summarize the AUNEC improvements in percentage brought by the proposed framework of all the baseline methods on all the datasets. We also illustrate the N -MAE trade-off curves for some cases in Figure 2, where the blue curves indicate the results achieved by fixed \u03f5 version while the red curves are for dynamic \u03f5. Other baselines and datasets yield similar curves, which we include in Appendix H.1 due to the space limitation. These results show that the dynamic \u03f5 versions of all the baseline methods achieve much better N -MAE trade-off (\u221215.66% to \u221222.61% averaged improvements as smaller AUNEC indicates better performance), demonstrating the effectiveness and the wide applicability of the proposed framework. As discussed in previous sections, datasets usually have diverse key distributions at different data localities, and the proposed framework can data-dependently adjust \u03f5 to fully utilize the distribution information of data localities and thus achieve better index performance in terms of N -MAE trade-off. Here the Map dataset has significant non-linearity caused by spatial characteristics, and it is hard to fit using linear segments (all baseline methods learn linear segments), thus relatively small improvements are achieved. Querying Time Improvements. Recall that the querying time of each data point is in O(log(N) + log(|y \u2212 y\u0302|) as we mentioned in Section 3.1, where N and |y \u2212 y\u0302| are inversely impacted by \u03f5. To examine whether the performance improvements w.r.t. N -MAE trade-off (i.e., Table 1) can lead to better querying efficiency in real-world systems, we show the averaged total querying time per query and the actual learned index size in bytes for two scenarios in Figure 3. We also mark the 99th percentile (P99) latency as the right bar. We can observe that the dynamic \u03f5 versions indeed gain faster average querying speed, since we improve both the term N as well as the term |y \u2212 y\u0302| via adaptive adjustment of \u03f5. Besides, we find that the dynamic version achieves comparable or even better P99 results than the static version, due to the fact that our method effectively adjust \u03f5 based on the expected \u03f5\u0303 and data characteristic, making the {\u03f5i} fluctuated within a moderate range and leading to a good robustness. The similar conclusion can be drawn from other baselines and datasets, and we present their results in Appendix H.1. Another thing to note is that, this experiment also verifies the usability of our framework in which users can flexibly set the expected \u03f5\u0303 to meet various space-time preferences just as they set \u03f5 in the original learned index methods. Index Building Cost. Comparing with the original learned index methods that adopt a fixed \u03f5, we introduces extra computation to dynamically adjust \u03f5 in the index building stage. Does this affect the efficiency of original methods? Here we report the relative increments of building times in Table 2. From it, we can observe that the proposed dynamic \u03f5 framework achieves comparable building times to all the original learned index methods on all the datasets, showing the efficiency of our framework since it retains the online learning manner with the same complexity as the original methods (both in O(|D|)). Note that we only need to pay this extra cost once, i.e., building the index once, and then the index structures can accelerate the frequent data querying operations for real-world applications. 4.3 ABLATION STUDY OF DYNAMIC \u03f5 To gain further insights about how the proposed dynamic \u03f5 framework works, we compare the proposed one with three dynamic \u03f5 variants: (1) Random \u03f5 is a vanilla version that randomly choose \u03f5 from [0, 2\u03f5\u0303] when learning each new segment; (2) Polynomial Learner differs our framework with another polynomial function SegErr(\u03f5) = \u03b81\u03f5\u03b82 where \u03b81 and \u03b82 are trainable parameters; (3) Least Square Learner differs our framework with an optimal (but very costly) strategy to learn f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) with the least square regression. We summarize the AUNEC changes in percentage compared to the proposed framework in Table 3. Here we only report the results for FITing-Tree due to the space limitation and similar results can be observed for other methods. Recall that for AUNEC, the smaller, the better. From this table, we have the following observations: (1) The Random \u03f5 version achieves much worse results than the proposed dynamic \u03f5 framework, showing the necessity and effectiveness of learning the impact of \u03f5. (2) The Polynomial Learner achieves better results than the Random \u03f5 version while still have a large performance gap compared to our proposed framework. This indicates the usefulness of the derived theoretical results that link the index performance, the \u03f5 and the data characteristics together. (3) For the Least Square Learner, we can see that it achieves similar AUNEC results compared with the proposed framework. However, it has higher computational complexity and pays the cost of much larger building times, e.g., 14\u00d7 and 53\u00d7 longer building times on IoT and Map respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework that adjusts \u03f5 based on the theoretical results, which will be validated next. 4.4 CASE STUDY We visualize the partial learned segments for FITing-Tree with fixed and dynamic \u03f5 on IoT dataset in Figure 4, where the N and\u2211 SegErri indicates the number of learned segments and the total prediction error for the shown segments respectively. The \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u00b5/\u03c3 indicates the characteristics of covered data {Di}. We can see that our dynamic framework helps the learned index gain both smaller space (7 v.s. 4) and smaller total prediction errors (48017 v.s. 29854). Note that \u03f5s within \u2212\u2192\u03f5i are diverse due to the diverse linearity of different data localities: For the data whose positions are within about [30000, 30600] and [34700, 35000], the proposed framework chooses large \u03f5s as their \u00b5/\u03c3s are small, and by doing so, it achieves smaller N than the fixed version by absorbing these non-linear localities; For the data at the middle part, they have clear linearity with large \u00b5/\u03c3s, and thus the proposed framework adjusts \u03f5 as 19 and 10 that are smaller than 32 to achieve better precision. These experimental observations are consistent with our analysis in the paragraph under Eq. (2), and clearly confirm that the proposed framework adaptively adjusts \u03f5 based on data characteristics. 4.5 OVERVIEW OF MORE EXPERIMENTS IN APPENDIX: Due to the space limitation, we provide further experiments and analysis in Appendix, including: \u2022 More results about the overall index performance (Appx.H.1) and ablation studies (Appx.H.3) on other datasets and methods, which support similar conclusions in Sec.4.2 and Sec.4.4. \u2022 The theoretical validation (Appx.H.2) for Theorem 1 that SegErri is within the derived bounds, and Theorem 2 that the learned slopes of various \u03f5-bounded methods have the same trends and both concentrate on 1/\u00b5i with a bounded difference. This shows that baselines have the same mathematical forms as we derived, and the proposed \u03f5-learner works well with wide applicability. \u2022 The insights about which kinds of datasets will benefit from our dynamic adjustment (Appx.H.4), with the help of an indicative quantity, the coefficient of variation value (\u03c3/\u00b5). \u2022 The comparison between \u03f5-based learned index methods and data-layout optimization based methods (Appx.I), which shows the competitiveness of the studied kind of learned index approach. 5 CONCLUSIONS: Existing learned index methods introduce an important hyper-parameter \u03f5 to provide a worst-case preciseness guarantee and meet various space-time user preferences. In this paper, we provide formal analysis about the relationships among \u03f5, data local characteristics and the introduced quantity SegErri for each learned segment, which is the product of the number of covered keys and MAE, and thus embeds the space-time trade-off. Based on the derived bounds, we present a pluggable dynamic \u03f5 framework that leverages an \u03f5-learner to data-dependently adjust \u03f5 and achieve better index performance in terms of space-time trade-off. A series of experiments verify the effectiveness, efficiency and usability of the proposed framework. We believe that our work contributes a deeper understanding of how the \u03f5 impacts the index performance, and enlightens the exploration of fine-grained trade-off adjustments by considering data local characteristics. Our study also opens several interesting future works. For example, we can apply the proposed framework to other problems in which the piece-wise approximation algorithms with fixed \u03f5 are used while still requiring space-time trade-off, such as similarity search and lossy compression for time series data (Chen et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2014; Buragohain et al., 2007; O\u2019Rourke, 1981). REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT For the Theorem 1 presented in Section 3.3, we give a complete proof in Appendix A. For the theoretical analysis about the learned slopes of mentioned \u03f5-bounded methods, we give complete proof in Appendix B. We also provide more implementation details of our method and baselines in Appendix F, including experimental setups, method configurations and hyperparameters. More detailed description of the adopted datasets is included in Appendix G. To facilitate the reproducibitlity, we share downloadable source codes and IPython notebooks, and attach binary files of the public experimental datasets in the anonymous link, https://github.com/AnonyResearcher/ICLR-2240. A PROOF OF THEOREM 1: Given a learned segment Si : y = aix+ bi, denote ci as the stored position of the last covered data for the (i\u2212 1)-th segment (c1 = 0 for the first segment). We can write the expectation of SegErri for the segment Si as the following form: E[SegErri] = E (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |aiXj + bi \u2212 (j + ci + 1)|  , where j\u2217 indicates the length of the segment, and Xj indicates the j-th key covered by the segment Si. As studied in Ferragina et al. (2020), the linear-approximation problem with \u03f5 guarantee can be modeled as random walk processes. Specifically, Xj = X0 + \u2211j k=0 Gk (for j \u2208 Z>0) where Gk is the key increment variable whose mean and variance is \u00b5 and \u03c32 respectively. Denote the Zj = Xj \u2212 j/ai + (bi \u2212 ci \u2212 1)/ai as the j-th position of the transformed random walk {Zj}j\u2208N, and j\u2217 = max{j \u2208 N| \u2212 \u03f5/ai \u2264 Zj \u2264 \u03f5/ai} as the random variable indicating the maximal position when the random walk is within the strip of boundary \u00b1\u03f5/ai. The expectation can be rewritten as: E (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |aiXj \u2212 j + (bi \u2212 ci \u2212 1)|  = aiE (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |Zj |  = ai \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n). (3) The last equality in Eq. (3) is due to the definition of expectation. Following the MET algorithm that the Si goes through the point (X0, Y0 = ci + 1), we get bi = \u2212aiX0 + ci + 1 and we can rewrite Zj as the following form: Z0 = 0, Zj j>0 = Xj \u2212X0 \u2212 j/ai = j\u2211 k=1 Gk \u2212 j/ai = j\u2211 k=1 (Gk \u2212 1/ai) = j\u2211 k=1 (Wk), where Wk is the walk increment variable of Zj , E[Wk] = \u00b5 \u2212 1/ai and V ar[Wk] = \u03c32. Under the MET algorithm setting where ai = 1/\u00b5 and \u03b5\u226b \u03c3/\u00b5, the transformed random walk {Zj} has increments with zero mean and variance \u03c32, and many steps are necessary to reach the random walk boundary. With the Central Limit Theorem, we can assume that Zj follows the normal distribution with mean \u00b5zj and variance \u03c32zj , and thus |Zj | follows the folded normal distribution: Zj \u223c N ( (\u00b5\u2212 1/ai)j, j\u03c32 ) , E(|Zj |) = \u00b5zj [1\u2212 2\u03a6(\u2212 \u00b5zj/\u03c3zj)] + \u03c3zj \u221a 2/\u03c0 exp(\u2212\u00b52zj/2\u03c32zj), where \u03a6 is the normal cumulative distribution function. For the MET algorithm, ai = 1/\u00b5 and thus the \u00b5zj = 0, \u03c3zj = \u03c3 \u221a j, and E(|Zj |) = \u221a 2/\u03c0\u03c3 \u221a j. Then the Eq. (3) can be written as 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n) < 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 E [|Zj |] Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j Pr(j\u2217 = n). (4) For the inner sum term in Eq. (4), we have ( \u2211n\u22121 j=0 \u221a j) < 23n \u221a n since n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j < n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j + \u221a n 2 < \u222b n 0 \u221a x dx = 2 3 n \u221a n, then the result in Eq. (4) becomes E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n \u221a nPr(j\u2217 = n) = 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 E[(j\u2217) 3 2 ] = 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 E [( (j\u2217)2 ) 3 4 ] \u2264 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 ( E[(j\u2217)2] ) 3 4 , where the last inequality holds due to the Jensen inequality E[X 34 ] \u2264 (E[X]) 3 4 . Using E[j\u2217] = \u00b52 \u03c32 \u03f52 and V ar[j\u2217] = 2 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54 derived in MET algorithm Ferragina et al. (2020), we get E[(j\u2217)2] = 5 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54, which yields the following upper bound: E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 )2\u03f53. For the lower bound, applying the triangle inequality into the Eq. (3), we have 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n) > 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ | n\u22121\u2211 j=0 Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n) = 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [|Z|] Pr(j\u2217 = n), (5) where Z = \u2211n\u22121 j=0 Zj . Since Zj \u223c N(0, \u03c32zj), the Z follows the normal distribution: Z \u223c N ( \u00b5Z = 0, \u03c3 2 Z = n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03c32zj + n\u22121\u2211 j=0 n\u22121\u2211 k=0,k \u0338=j rjk\u03c3zj\u03c3zk ) , where rjk is the correlation between Zj and Zk. Since \u00b5Z = 0, the |Z| follows the folded normal distribution with E[|Z|] = \u03c3Z \u221a 2/\u03c0. Since the random walk {Zj} is a process with i.i.d. increments, the correlation rjk \u2265 0. With \u03c3zj = \u03c3 \u221a j > 0 and rjk \u2265 0, we have E[|Z|] > \u221a 2 \u03c0 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03c3zj > \u03c3 \u221a n(n\u2212 1)/\u03c0 > \u03c3(n\u2212 1)\u221a \u03c0 , and the result in Eq. (5) becomes: E[SegErri] > 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E | n\u22121\u2211 j=0 Zj | Pr(j\u2217 = n) > \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 (n\u2212 1)Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 E [j\u2217 \u2212 1] = \u221a 1 \u03c0 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 \u03f52 \u2212 \u03c3 \u00b5 ). Since \u03f5\u226b \u03c3\u00b5 , we can omit the right term \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 and finish the proof. B LEARNED SLOPES OF OTHER \u03f5-BOUNDED METHODS As shown in Theorem 1, we have known how \u03f5 impacts the SegErri of each segment learned by the MET algorithm, where the theoretical derivations largely rely on the slope condition ai = 1/\u00b5. Here we prove that for other \u03f5-bounded methods, the learned slope of each segment (i.e., ai of Si) concentrates on the reciprocal of the expected key interval as shown in the following Theorem. Theorem 2. Given an \u03f5 \u2208 Z>1 and an \u03f5-bounded learned index algorithm A. For a linear segment Si : y = aix + bi learned by A, denote its covered data and the number of covered keys as Di and Len(Di) respectively. Assuming the expected key interval of Di is \u00b5i, the learned slope ai concentrates on a\u0303 = 1/\u00b5i with bounded relative difference: (1\u2212 2\u03f5 E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1 )a\u0303 \u2264 E[ai] \u2264 (1 + 2\u03f5 E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1 )a\u0303. Proof. For the learned linear segment Si, denote its first predicted position and last predicted position as y\u20320 and y \u2032 n respectively, we have its slope ai = y\u2032n\u2212y \u2032 0 xn\u2212x0 . Notice that y0 \u2212 \u03f5 \u2264 y \u2032 0 \u2264 y0 + \u03f5 and yn \u2212 \u03f5 \u2264 y\u2032n \u2264 yn + \u03f5 due to the \u03f5 guarantee, we have yn \u2212 y0 \u2212 2\u03f5 \u2264 y\u2032n \u2212 y\u20320 \u2264 yn \u2212 y0 + 2\u03f5 and the expectation of ai can be written as E[yn \u2212 y0 + 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ] \u2264 E[ai] = y\u2032n \u2212 y\u20320 xn \u2212 x0 \u2264 E[yn \u2212 y0 + 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ]. Note that for any learned segment Si whose first covered data is (x0, y0) and last covered data is (xn, yn), we have E[xn\u2212x0yn\u2212y0 ] = \u00b5i and thus the inequalities become 1 \u00b5 \u2212 E[ 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ] \u2264 E[ai] \u2264 1 \u00b5 + E[ 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ]. Since a\u0303 = 1/\u00b5i and E[xn \u2212 x0] = (E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1)\u00b5i, we finish the proof. The Theorem 2 shows that the relative deviations between learned slope ai and a\u0303 are within 2\u03f5/(E[Len(Di)] \u2212 1). For the MET and PGM learned index methods, we have the following corollary that depicts preciser deviations without the expectation term E[Len(Di)]. Corollary 2.1. For the MET method Ferragina et al. (2020) and the optimal \u03f5-bounded linear approximation method that learns the largest segment length used in PGM Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b), the slope relative differences are at O(1/\u03f5). Proof. We note that the segment length of a learned segment is at O(\u03f52) for the MET algorithm, which is proved in the Theorem 1 of Ferragina et al. (2020). Since PGM achieves the largest learned segment length that is larger than the one of the MET algorithm, we finish the proof. C CONNECTING PREDICTION ERROR WITH SEARCHING STRATEGY: As we mentioned in Section 3.1, we can find the true position of the queried data point in O(log(N)+ log(|y\u0302 \u2212 y|)) where N is the number of learned segments and |y\u0302 \u2212 y| is the absolute prediction error. A binary search or exponential search finds the stored true position y based on y\u0302. It is worth pointing out that the searching cost in terms of searching range |y\u0302 \u2212 y| of binary search strategy corresponds to the maximum absolute prediction error \u03f5, whereas the one of exponential search corresponds to the mean absolute prediction error (MAE). In this paper, we decouple the quantity SegErri as the product of Len(Di) and MAE(Di|Si) in the derivation of Theorem 1. Built upon the theoretical analysis, we adopt exponential search in experiments to better leverage the predictive models. To clarify, let\u2019s consider a learned segment Si with its covered data Di. Let |y\u0302k \u2212 yk| be the absolute prediction error of k-th data point covered by this segment, and \u03f5i be the maximum absolute prediction error of Si, i.e., |y\u0302k \u2212 yk| \u2264 \u03f5i for all k \u2208 [len(Di)]. \u2022 The binary search is conducted within the searching range [y\u0302k \u00b1 \u03f5i] for each data point 2, thus the mean search range is 1len(Di) \u2211len(Di) k=1 2\u03f5i = O(\u03f5i), which is independent of the preciseness of the learned segment and an upper bound of MAE(Di|Si). \u2022 The exponential search first finds the searching range where the queried data may exist by centering around the y\u0302, repeatedly doubling the range [y\u0302 \u00b1 2q] where the integer q grows from 0, and comparing the queried data with the data points at positions y\u0302\u00b12q . After finding the specific range such that a qk satisfies 2log(qk)\u22121 \u2264 |y\u0302k \u2212 yk| \u2264 2\u2308log(qk)\u2309 for the k-th data, an binary search is conducted to find the exact location. In this way, the mean search range is 1len(Di) \u2211len(Di) k=1 (2 \u2308log(qk)\u2309+1) = O ( MAE(Di|Si) ) , which can be much smaller than O(\u03f5i) especially for strong predictive models and the datasets having clear linearity. D THE ALGORITHM OF DYNAMIC \u03f5 ADJUSTMENT In Section 3.4, we provide detailed description about the initialization and adjustment sub-procedures. The lookahead() and optimize() are in the \u201cLook-ahead Data\u201d and \u201c \u02dcSegErr and Optimization\u201d paragraph respectively. E INHERITING THE ABILITIES OF EXISTING WORKS In this Section, we discuss the benefits of our proposed framework brought by its pluggable property with two example scenarios, the dynamic data update and hard limitation on user-required index size. We note that the data insert operation has been discussed in the adopted baseline methods, FITing-Tree Galakatos et al. (2019) and PGM Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b). More importantly, neither of these two methods altered the notion of \u03f5 when dealing with the data insertion, and they still relied on their \u03f5-bounded piece-wise segmentation algorithms. The proposed framework is still valid when using their respective solutions to handle the data insertion. Specifically, FITing-Tree proposes to introduce a buffer for each learned segment, which is used to store the inserted keys, and when the buffer is full, the data covered by the segment will be re-segmented (see Section 5 in Galakatos et al. (2017)). PGM adopts a logarithmic method O\u2019Neil et al. (1996); Overmars (1987) that maintains a series of sorted sets {S0, S1, ..., Sb} where b = \u03b8(log(|D|)), and builds multiple PGM-INDEX models over the sets. When a key x is inserted, a new PGM-INDEX will be built over the merged sets (see Section 3 in Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b)). In general, these solutions proposed by existing methods for inserting keys are based on re-indexing for a piece of data along with the inserted data, and the re-indexing processes are the same as the original piece-wise linear segmentation processes but for different data, therefore, we can still apply the proposed dynamic-\u03f5 framework for these methods in insertion scenarios just like we adjust \u03f5 and learn index according to the new data to be re-indexed. 2The lower bound and upper bounds of searching ranges should be constricted to 0 and len(Di) respectively. For brevity, we omit the corner cases when comparing these two searching strategies as they both need to handle the out-of-bounds scenario.

Our proposed framework is pluggable and still valid when using the PGM variant to handle the size requirement. Specifically, given a space constraint, the multi-criteria PGM propose to iteratively estimate the relationship between \u03f5 and size with a learnable function size(\u03f5) = a\u03f5\u2212b, and automatically outputs the index that minimizes its query time via different estimated \u03f5s. Given a size requirement, we can just do the same thing in dynamic \u03f5 scene by setting our \u03f5\u0303 as \u03f5 estimated by the original PGM method. F IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS All the experiments are conducted on a Linux server with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8163 2.50GHz CPU. We first introduce more details and the implementation of baseline learned index methods. MET (Ferragina et al., 2020) fixes the segment slope as the reciprocal of the expected key interval, and goes through the first available data point for each segment. FITing-Tree (Galakatos et al., 2019) adopts a greedy shrinking cone algorithm and the learned segments are organized with a B+-tree. Here we use the stx::btree (v0.9) implementation (Bingmann, 2013) and set the filling factors of inner nodes and leaf nodes as 100%, i.e., we adopt the full-paged filling manner. Radix-Spline (Kipf et al., 2020) adopts a greedy spline interpolating algorithm to learn spline points, and the learned spline segments are organized with a flat radix table. We set the number of radix bits as r = 16 for the Radix-Spline method, which means that the leveraged radix table contains 216 entries. PGM (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b) adopts a convex hull based algorithm to achieve the minimum number of learned segments, and the segments can be organized with the help of binary search, CSS-Tree (Rao & Ross, 1999) and recursive structure. Here we implement the recursive version since it beats the other two variants in terms of indexing performance. For all the baselines and our method, we adopt exponential search to better leverage the predictive models since the query complexity using exponential search corresponds the preciseness of models (MAE) as we analyzed in Appendix C. We then describe a few additional details of the proposed framework in terms of the \u03f5-learner initialization and the hyper-parameter setting. For the w1,2,3 of the \u03f5-learner shown in the Eq. (2), at the beginning, we learn the first five segments with the \u03f5 sequence [ 14 \u03f5\u0303, 1 2 \u03f5\u0303, \u03f5\u0303, 2\u03f5\u0303, 4\u03f5\u0303], then track their rewarded SegErri and update the parameters w1,2,3 using least square regression. We empirically found that this light-weight initialization leads to better index performance compared to the versions with random parameter initialization, and it benefits the exploration of diverse \u03f5\u2217, i.e., leading to the larger variance of the dynamic \u03f5 sequence [\u03f51, . . . , \u03f5i, . . . , \u03f5N ]. As for the hyper-parameter \u03c1 (described in the Section 3.4), we conduct grid search over \u03c1 \u2208 [0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0] on Map an IoT datasets. We found that all the \u03c1s achieve better N -MAE trade-off (i.e., smaller AUNEC results) than the fixed \u03f5 versions. Since the setting \u03c1 = 0.4 achieves averagely best results on the two datasets, we set \u03c1 to be 0.4 for the other datasets. G DATASET DETAILS: Our framework is verified on several widely adopted datasets having different data scales and distributions. Weblogs Kraska et al. (2018); Galakatos et al. (2019); Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b) contains about 715M log entries for the requests to a university web server and the keys are log timestamps. IoT Galakatos et al. (2019); Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b) contains about 26M event entries from different IoT sensors in a building and the keys are recording timestamps. Map dataset Kraska et al. (2018); Galakatos et al. (2019); Ding et al. (2020); Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b); Li et al. (2021) contains location coordinates of 200M places that are collected around the world from the Open Street Map OpenStreetMap contributors (2017), and the keys are the longitudes of these places. Lognormal Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b) is a synthetic dataset whose key intervals follow the lognormal distribution: ln(Gi) \u223c N (\u00b5lg, \u03c32lg). To simulate the varied data characteristics among different localities. We generate 20M keys with 40 partitions by setting \u00b5lg = 1 and setting \u03c3lg with a random number within [0.1, 1] for each partition. We normalize the positions of stored data into the range [0, 1], and thus the key-position distribution can be modeled as Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). We plot the CDFs and zoomed-in CDFs of experimental datasets in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively, which intuitively illustrate the diversity of the adopted datasets. For example, the CDF visualization of the Map dataset shows that it has a fairly shifted distribution across different data localities, verifying of necessity of dynamically adapting and adjusting the learned index algorithms just as we considered in this paper. H ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: H.1 OVERALL INDEX PERFORMANCE. For the N -MAE trade-off improvements and the actual querying efficiency improvements brought by the proposed framework, we illustrate more N -MAE trade-off curves in Figure 7 and querying time results in Figure 8. We also mark the 99th percentile (P99) latency as the right bar, which is a useful metric in industrial-scale practical systems. Recall that the N -MAE trade-off curve adequately reflects the index size and querying time: (1) the segment size in bytes and N are only different by a constant factor, e.g., the size of a segment can be 128bit if it consists of two double-precision float parameters (slope and intercept); (2) the querying operation can be done in O(log(N) + log(|y \u2212 y\u0302|) as we mentioned in Section 3.1, thus a better N -MAE trade-off indicates a better querying efficiency. From these figures, we can see that the dynamic \u03f5 versions of all the baseline methods achieve better N -MAE trade-off and better querying efficiency, verifying the effectiveness and the wide applicability of the proposed framework. Regards the p99 metrics, we can see that the dynamic version achieves comparable or even better P99 results than the static version, showing that the proposed method not only improves the average lookup time, but also has a good robustness. This is because of that our method can effectively adjust \u03f5 based on the expected \u03f5\u0303 and data characteristic, making the {\u03f5i} fluctuated within a moderate range. H.2 THEORETICAL RESULTS VALIDATION We study the impact of \u03f5 on SegErri for the MET algorithm in Theorem 1, where the derivations are based on the setting of the slope condition ai = 1/\u00b5. To confirm that the proposed framework also works well with other \u03f5-bounded learned index methods, we analyze the learned slopes of other \u03f5-bounded methods in Theorem 2. In summary, we prove that for a segment Si : y = aix+ bi whose covered data is Di and the expected key interval of Di is \u00b5i, then ai concentrates on 1/\u00b5i within 2\u03f5/(E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1) relative deviations. Here we plot the learned slopes of baseline learned index methods in Figure 9 (Map dataset) and in Figure 11 (IoT, Weblogs and Lognormal datasets). We can see that the learned slopes of other methods indeed center along the line ai = 1/\u00b5i, showing the close connections among these methods and confirming that the proposed framework can work well with other \u03f5-bounded learned index methods. We further compare the theoretical bounds with the actual SegErri for all the adopted learned index methods. We show the results on Lognormal dataset in Figure 10, and the results on another two datasets Gamma and Uniform in Figure 12, where the key intervals of the latter two datasets follow gamma distribution and uniform distribution respectively. As expected, we can see that the MET method has the actual SegErri within the derived bounds, verifying the correctness of the Theorem 1. Besides, the other \u03f5-bounded methods show the same trends with the MET method, providing the evidence that these methods have the same mathematical forms as we derived, and thus the \u03f5-learner also works well with them. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1/\u00b5i 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 a i IoT Dataset ai = 1/\u00b5i FITing-Tree RadixSpline PGM Figure 9: Learned slopes. 100 200 300 400 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 L o g (S e g E rr ) Lognormal \u00b5 = 1 \u03c3 = 0.5 MET Upper Bound MET MET Lower Bound PGM RadixSpline FITing-Tree 100 200 300 400 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 L o g (S e g E rr ) Lognormal \u00b5 = 1 \u03c3 = 1 MET Upper Bound MET MET Lower Bound PGM RadixSpline FITing-Tree Figure 10: Illustration of the derived bounds. H.3 ABLATION STUDY To examine the necessity and the effectiveness of the proposed framework, in Section 4.3, we compare the proposed framework with three dynamic \u03f5 variants for the FITing-Tree method. Here we demonstrate the AUNEC relative changes for the Radix-Spline method with the same three variants in Table 4 and similar conclusions can be drawn. H.4 CV AS AN INDICATIVE QUANTITY The coefficient of variation (CV) value, i.e., CV =\u03c3/\u00b5, plays an important factor in our bounds to reflect the linearity degree of the data. We have seen that CV is effective to help dynamically adjust \u03f5 in our framework as shown in our experiments. Here we explore that whether the CV value can be an indicative quantity to shed light on what types of data will benefit from our dynamic adjustment? To be specific, we calculate the CV values of the experimental datasets and compare them with the trade-off improvements. The global CV values of IoT, Map, Lognormal and Weblogs are 65.24, 11.12, 0.85, and 0.013 respectively, while their AUNEC improved by 20.71%, 6.47%, 21.89% and 26.96% respectively. With the exception of IoT, the rest of the results show that the smaller the CV value is, the greater the trade-off improvement of dynamic \u03f5 brings. We find that IoT is a locally linear but globally fluctuant dataset. We then divide the data into 5000 segments and calculate their average CV values. The local CV values of IoT, Map, Lognormal and Weblogs are 0.95, 2.18, 0.63, and 0.005 respectively, which is consistent with the improvement trends. Intuitively, when the local CV value is small, the local data is hard-to-fit with a few linear segments if we adopt an improper \u03f5, and we need more fine-grained \u03f5 adjustment rather than the fixed setting. Thus we can expect more performance improvements in this case. The calculation of actual CV values of real-world datasets helps to validate our \u03f5 analysis based on the CV values, and provides further insight into the scenarios where the proposed method has strong potential to outperform existing methods. I COMPARISON WITH DATA-LAYOUT-OPTIMIZATION BASED METHODS: In this paper, we mainly focus on the \u03f5-based learned index methods. In recent years, some datalayout-optimization based methods (Ding et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) also gain promising indexing performance. These two performance optimization perspectives are relatively orthogonal. Both types of the learned index methods have their pros and cons: Worst-case guarantee. For the \u03f5-bounded methods (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Stoian et al., 2021; Galakatos et al., 2019; Ferragina et al., 2020; Kipf et al., 2020), the most important advantage they provide is the worst-case guarantee in each segment. This property is fairly valuable in many realistic indexing applications such as financial databases and on-device intelligence. Also note that our approach still maintains comparable 99th percentile (P99) performance compared to static \u03f5 baselines as shown in the overall index performance comparison (Figure 3 and Figure 8). Index Size. Data layout based approaches such as ALEX (Ding et al., 2020) do achieve better indexing performance in dynamic scenarios, but it pays a larger index size overhead because of the introduced gap insertion technique (reserving empty space for possibly inserted data). Empirically, we examine the performance of ALEX with our experimental settings and find that it gains comparable query time and larger index size than learned index with dynamic \u03f5 as the following Table 5 shows, where the qtime and index size are in ns and KB respectively. We adopt the default hyper-parameters of ALEX and the is 4, 32, 64 and 32 in these four datasets respectively for RadixSpline. We note that the index size is still very important even with the large amount of memory available today, as shown by the fact that almost all related learned index works examine this metric in their experiments. It is worth noting that index size can have a significant impact on latency indirectly, since the smaller the index, the more it can fit into the hierarchical high speed CPU caches, and thus increase the hit rates to speed up the overall indexing performance Zhang & Gao (2022); Zhang et al. (2021). Moreover, in some practical applications, the available memory can be relative small such as cases where users need to build index from multiple keys of the data, and need to use index on IoT devices for edge computation. Dynamic Hyper-parameter. Moreover, our novel framework can be regarded as an automatic method that determines hyper-parameters (\u03f5) according to the varied local properties of the data. Although the data layout optimization goes beyond our scope, our insight can also contribute to the ALEX approach, since it also introduces hyper-parameters in local linear segments learning, the lower and upper density limits on each gapped array: dl, du \u2208 (0, 1]. The authors empirically set them to be 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. However, different gapped arrays may gain better performance with different density limitations, since the data distribution can be varied across different localities, as we have shown in experiments.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023. Remember you need to make 3 reviewer agents for each paper. GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Learned Index with Dynamic $\\epsilon$\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Data indexing (Graefe & Kuno, 2011; Wang et al., 2018; Luo & Carey, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), which stores keys and corresponding payloads with designed structures, supports efficient query operations over data and benefits various data retrieval applications. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) models have been incorporated into the design of index structure, leading to substantial improvements in terms of both storage space and querying efficiency (Kipf et al., 2019; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020a; Mitzenmacher, 2018; Vaidya et al., 2021). The key insight behind this trending topic of \u201clearned index\u201d is that the data to be indexed contain useful distribution information and such information can be utilized by trainable ML models that map the keys {x} to their stored positions {y}. To approximate the data distribution, state-of-the-art (SOTA) learned index methods (Galakatos et al., 2019; Kipf et al., 2020; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Ferragina et al., 2020; Stoian et al., 2021) propose to learn piece-wise linear segments S = [S1, ..., Si, ..., SN ], where Si : y = aix+ bi is the linear segment parameterized by (ai, bi) and N is the total number of learned segments. These methods introduce an important pre-defined parameter \u03f5 \u2208 Z>1 and adopt the following online learning process: Beginning from the first available data point, the current linear segment adjusts (ai, bi) and covers as many data points as possible until a data point, say (x\u2032, y\u2032) achieves the prediction error |Si(x\u2032)\u2212 y\u2032| > \u03f5. The violation of \u03f5 triggers a new linear segment, and the data point (x\u2032, y\u2032) will be the first available data point. The process repeats until no data point is available and as a result, the worst-case preciseness can be guaranteed with \u03f5. By tuning \u03f5, various space-time preferences from users can be met. For example, a relatively large \u03f5 can result in a small index size while having large prediction errors, and on the other hand, a relatively small \u03f5 provides users with small prediction errors while having more learned segments and thus a large index size. Existing learned index methods implicitly assume that the whole dataset to be indexed contains the same characteristics for different localities and thus adopt the same \u03f5 for all the learned segments. However, the scenario where there is varied local data distribution, is very common, leading to sub-optimal index performance of existing methods. For example, the real-world Weblog dataset used in our experiment has typically non-linear temporal patterns caused by online campus transactions such as class schedule arrangements, weekends and holidays. More importantly, the impact of \u03f5 on index performance is intrinsically linked to data characteristics, which are not fully explored and utilized by existing learned index methods. Motivated by these, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the impact of \u03f5 on index performance, and link the characteristics of data localities with the dynamic adjustments of \u03f5. Based on the derived theoretical results, we propose an efficient and pluggable learned index framework that dynamically adjusts \u03f5 in a principled way. To be specific, under the setting of an illustrative learned index method MET (Ferragina et al., 2020), we present novel analysis about the prediction error bounds of each segment that link \u03f5 with the mean and variance of data localities. The segment-wise prediction error embeds the space-time trade-off as it is the product of the number of covered keys and mean absolute error, which determine the index size and preciseness respectively. The derived mathematical relationships enable our framework to fully explore diverse data localities with an \u03f5-learner module, which learns to predict the impact of \u03f5 on the index performance and adaptively choose a suitable \u03f5 to achieve a better space-time trade-off. We apply the proposed framework to several SOTA learned index methods, and conduct a series of experiments on three widely adopted real-world datasets. Comparing with the original learned index methods with fixed \u03f5, our dynamic \u03f5 versions achieve significant index performance improvements with better space-time trade-offs. We also conduct various experiments to verify the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed framework, and provide both ablation study and case study to understand how the proposed framework works. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We make the first step to exploit the potential of dynamically adjusting \u03f5 for learned indexes, and propose an efficient and pluggable framework that can be applied to a broad class of piece-wise approximation algorithms. \u2022 We provide theoretical analysis for a proxy task modeling the index space-time trade-off, which establishes our \u03f5-learner based on the data characteristics and the derived bounds. \u2022 We achieve significant index performance improvements over several SOTA learned index methods on real-world datasets. To facilitate further studies, we make our codes and datasets public at https://github.com/AnonyResearcher/ICLR-2240. 2 BACKGROUND: Learned Index. Given a dataset D = {(x, y)|x \u2208 X , y \u2208 Y}, X is the set of keys over a universe U such as reals or integers, and Y is the set of positions where the keys and corresponding payloads are stored. The index such as B+-tree (Abel, 1984) aims to build a compact structure to support efficient query operations over D. Typically, the keys are assumed to be sorted in ascending order to satisfy the key-position monotonicity, i.e., for any two keys, xi > xj iff their positions yi > yj , such that the range query (X \u2229 [xlow, xhigh]) can be handled. Recently, learned index methods (Kraska et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Crotty, 2021) leverage ML models to mine useful distribution information from D, and incorporate such information to boost the index performance. To look up a given key x, the learned index first predicts position y\u0302 using the learned models, and subsequently finds the stored true position y based on y\u0302 with a binary search or exponential search. Thus the querying time consists of the inference time of the learned models and the search time in O(log(|y\u0302 \u2212 y|)). By modeling the data distribution information, learned indexes achieve faster query speed than traditional B+-tree index, meanwhile using several orders-of-magnitude smaller storage space (Ding et al., 2020; Galakatos et al., 2019; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Kipf et al., 2020; Marcus et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). \u03f5-bounded Linear Approximation. Many existing learned index methods adopt piece-wise linear segments to approximate the distribution of D due to their effectiveness and low computing cost, and introduce the parameter \u03f5 to provide a worst-case preciseness guarantee and a tunable knob to meet various space-time trade-off preferences. Here we briefly introduce the SOTA \u03f5-bounded learned index methods that are most closely to our work, and refer readers to the literature (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020a; Marcus et al., 2020; Stoian et al., 2021) for details of other methods. We first describe an illustrative learned index algorithm MET (Ferragina et al., 2020). Specifically, for any two consecutive keys ofD, suppose their key interval (xi\u2212xi\u22121) is drawn according to a random process {Gi}i\u2208N, where Gi is a positive independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable whose mean is \u00b5 and variance is \u03c32. MET learns linear segments {Si : y = aix+ bi} via a simple deterministic strategy: the current segment fixes the slope ai = 1/\u00b5, goes through the first available data point and thus bi is determined. Then Si covers the remaining data points one by one until a data point (x\u2032, y\u2032) gains the prediction error larger than \u03f5. The violation triggers a new linear segment that begins from (x\u2032, y\u2032) and the process repeats until D has been traversed. Other \u03f5-bounded learned index methods learn linear segments in a similar manner to MET while having different mechanisms to determine the parameters of {Si}. FITing-Tree (Galakatos et al., 2019) uses a greedy shrinking cone algorithm. PGM (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b) adopts another one-pass algorithm that achieves the optimal number of learned segments. Radix-Spline (Kipf et al., 2020) introduces a radix structure to organize the learned segments. However, existing methods constrain all learned segments with the same \u03f5. All of these piece-wise segments based approaches attempt to improve performance by changing the way segments are learned or organized, but ignore the optimization potential of dynamically varying \u03f5. In this paper, we will discuss the impact of \u03f5 in more depth and investigate how to enhance existing learned index methods from a new perspective: dynamic adjustment of \u03f5 accounting for the diversity of different data localities. Besides, different from (Ferragina et al., 2020) that reveals the relationship between \u03f5 and index size performance based on MET. In Section 3.3, we present novel analysis about the impact of \u03f5 on not only the index size, but also the index preciseness and a comprehensive trade-off quantity, which facilitates the proposed dynamic \u03f5 adjustment. 3 LEARN TO VARY \u03f5 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION AND MOTIVATION: Before introducing the proposed framework, we first formulate the task of learning index from data with \u03f5 guarantee, and provide some discussions about why we need to vary \u03f5. Given a dataset D to be indexed and an \u03f5-bounded learned index algorithm A, we aim to learn linear segments S = [S1, ..., Si..., SN ] with segment-wise varied [\u03f5i]i\u2208[N ], such that a better trade-off between storage cost (size in KB) and query efficiency (time in ns) can be achieved than the ones using fixed \u03f5. Let Di \u2282 D be the data whose keys are covered by Si, for the remaining data D \\ \u22c3 j<iDj , the algorithm A repeatedly checks whether the prediction error of new data point violates the given \u03f5i and outputs the learned segment Si. When all the \u03f5is for i \u2208 [N ] take the same value, the problem becomes the one that existing learned index methods are dealing with. To facilitate theoretical analysis, we focus on two proxy quantities for the target space-time trade-off: (1) the number of learned segments N and (2) the mean absolute prediction error MAE(Di|Si), which is affected and upper-bounded by \u03f5i. We note that the improvements of N -MAE trade-off fairly and adequately reflect the improvements of the space-time trade-off: (1) The learned segments size in bytes and N are positively correlated and only different by a constant factor, e.g., the size of a segment can be 128bit if it consists of two double-precision float parameters (slope and intercept); (2) When using exponential search, the querying complexity is O(log(N) + log(MAE(Di|Si)), in which the first term indicates the finding process of the specific segment S\u2032 that covers the key x for a queried data point (x, y), and the second term indicates the search range |y\u0302 \u2212 y| for true position y based on the estimated one y\u0302 = S\u2032(x). In this paper, we adopt exponential search as search algorithm since it is better than binary search for exploiting the predictive ability of learned models. In Appendix D, we show that the search range of exponential search is O(MAE(Di|Si)), which can be much smaller than the one of binary search, O(\u03f5i), especially for strong predictive models and the datasets having clear linearity. Similar empirical support can be also found from (Ding et al., 2020). Now let\u2019s examine how the parameter \u03f5 affects the N -MAE trade-off. We can see that these two performance terms compete with each other and \u03f5 plays an important role to balance them. If we adopt a small \u03f5, the prediction error constraint is more frequently violated, leading to a large N ; meanwhile, the preciseness of learned index is improved, leading to a small MAE of the whole data MAE(D|S). On the other hand, with a large \u03f5, we will get a more compact learned index (i.e., a small N ) with larger prediction errors (i.e., a large MAE(D|S)). Actually, the effect of \u03f5 on index performance is intrinsically linked to the characteristic of the data to be indexed. For real-world datasets, an important observation is that the linearity degree varies in different data localities. Recall that we use piece-wise linear segments to fit the data, and \u03f5 determines the partition and the fitness of the segments. By varying \u03f5, we can adapt to the local variations of D and adjust the partition such that each learned segment fits the data better. Formally, let\u2019s consider the quantity SegErri that is defined as the total prediction error within a segment Si, i.e., SegErri \u225c \u2211 (x,y)\u2208Di |y \u2212 Si(x)|, which is also the product of the number of covered keys Len(Di) and the mean absolute error MAE(Di|Si). Note that a large Len(Di) leads to a small N since |D| = \u2211N i=1 Len(Di). From this view, the quantity SegErri internally reflects the N -MAE trade-off. Later we will show how to leverage this quantity to dynamically adjust \u03f5. 3.2 OVERALL FRAMEWORK: In practice, it is intractable to directly solve the problem formulated in Section 3.1. With a given \u03f5i, the one-pass algorithm A determines Si and Di until the error bound \u03f5i is violated. In other words, it is unknown what the data partition {Di} will be a priori, which makes it impossible to solve the problem by searching among all the possible {\u03f5i}s and learning index with a set of given {\u03f5i}. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently find an approximate solution to this problem via the introduced \u03f5-learner module. Instead of heuristically adjusting \u03f5, the \u03f5-learner learns to predict the impact of \u03f5 on the index structure and adaptively adjusts \u03f5 in a principled way. Meanwhile, the introducing of \u03f5-learner should not sacrifice the efficiency of the original one-pass learned index algorithms, which is important for real-world practical applications. These two design considerations establish our dynamic \u03f5 framework as shown in Figure 1. The \u03f5-learner is based on an estimation function SegErr = f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) that depicts the mathematical relationships among \u03f5, SegErri and the characteristics \u00b5, \u03c3 of the data to be indexed. As a start, users can provide an expected \u03f5\u0303 that indicates various preferences under space-sensitive or time-sensitive applications. To meet the user requirements, afterwards, we internally transform the \u03f5\u0303 into another proxy quantity \u02dcSegErr, which reflects the expected prediction error for each segment if we set \u03f5i = \u03f5\u0303. This transformation also links the adjustment of \u03f5 and data characteristics together, which enables the data-dependent adjustment of \u03f5. Beginning with \u03f5\u0303, the \u03f5-learner chooses a suitable \u03f5i according to current data characteristics, then learns a segment Si usingA, and finally enhances the \u03f5-learner with the rewarded ground-truth SegErri of each segment. To make the introduced adjustment efficient, we propose to only sample a small Look-ahead data D\u2032 to estimate the characteristics (\u00b5, \u03c3) of the following data locality. The learning process repeats and is also in an efficient one-pass manner. Note that the proposed framework provides users the same interface as the ones used by original learned index methods. That is, we do not add any additional cost to the users\u2019 experience, and users can smoothly and painlessly use our framework with given \u03f5\u0303 just as they use the original methods with given \u03f5. The \u03f5 is an intuitive, meaningful, easy-to-set and method-agnostic quantity for users. On the one hand, we can easily impose restrictions on the worst-case querying cases with \u03f5 as the data accessing number in querying process is O(log(|y\u0302 \u2212 y|)). On the other hand, \u03f5 is easier to estimate than the other quantities such as index size and querying time, which are dependent on specific algorithms, data layouts, implementations and experimental platforms. Our pluggable framework retains the benefits of existing learned index methods, such as the aforementioned usability of \u03f5, and the ability to handle dynamic update case and hard size requirement. 1 We have seen how \u03f5 determines index performance and how SegErri embeds the N -MAE trade-off in Section 3.1. In Section 3.3, we further theoretically analyze the relationship among \u03f5, SegErri, and data characteristics \u00b5, \u03c3 at different localities. Based on the analysis, we elaborate the details of \u03f5-learner and the internal transformation between \u03f5 and SegErri in Section 3.4. 3.3 PREDICTION ERROR ESTIMATION: In this section, we theoretically study the impact of \u03f5 on the prediction error SegErri of each learned segment Si. The derived closed-form relationships will be taken into account in the design of the proposed \u03f5-learner module (Section 3.4). Specifically, for the MET algorithm, we can prove the following theorem to bound the expectation of SegErri with \u03f5 and the key interval distribution of D. 1We discuss how to extend existing works in more details in Appendix E. Theorem 1. Given a dataset D to be indexed and an \u03f5 where \u03f5 \u2208 Z>1, consider the setting of the MET algorithm (Ferragina et al., 2020), in which key intervals ofD are drawn from a random process consisting of positive i.i.d. random variables with mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32, and \u03f5 \u226b \u03c3/\u00b5. For a learned segment Si and its covered data Di, denote SegErri = \u2211 (x,y)\u2208Di |y \u2212 Si(x)|. Then the expectation of SegErri satisfies:\u221a 1 \u03c0 \u00b5 \u03c3 \u03f52 < E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 )2\u03f53. Note that the average length of segments obtained by MET algorithm is (\u00b5\u03c3 ) 2\u03f52. We now get a constant 23 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 \u2248 0.78 that is tighter than the trivial one with 1 corresponding to the case where each data point reaches the largest error \u03f5. This theorem reveals that the prediction error SegErri depends on both \u03f5 and the data characteristics (\u00b5, \u03c3). Recall that CV =\u03c3/\u00b5 is the coefficient of variation, a classical statistical measure of the relative dispersion of data points. In the context of the linear approximation, the data statistic 1/CV = \u00b5/\u03c3 in our bounds intrinsically corresponds to the linearity degree of the data. With this, we can find that when \u00b5/\u03c3 is large, the data is easy-to-fit with linear segments, and thus we can choose a small \u03f5 to achieve precise predictions. On the other hand, when \u00b5/\u03c3 is small, it becomes harder to fit the data using a linear segment, and thus \u03f5 should be increased to absorb some non-linear data localities. In this way, we can make the total prediction error for different learned segments consistent and achieve a better N -MAE trade-off. This analysis also confirms the motivation of varying \u03f5: The local linearity degrees of the indexed data can be diverse, and we should adjust \u03f5 according to the local characteristic of the data, such that the learned index can fit and leverage the data distribution better. In the rest of this section, we provide a proof sketch of this theorem due to the space limitation. For detailed proof, please refer to our Appendix A. \u2022 TRANSFORMED RANDOM WALK. The main idea is to model the learning process of linear approximation with \u03f5 guarantee as a random walk process, and consider that the absolute prediction error of each data point follows folded normal distributions. Specifically, given a learned segment Si : y = aix+ bi, we can calculate the expectation of SegErri for this segment as: E[SegErri] = aiE (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |Zj |  = ai \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n), (1) where Zj is the j-th position of a transformed random walk {Zj}j\u2208N, j\u2217 = max{j \u2208 N| \u2212 \u03f5/ai \u2264 Zj \u2264 \u03f5/ai} is the random variable indicating the maximal position when the random walk is within the strip of boundary \u00b1\u03f5/ai, and the last equality is due to the definition of expectation. \u2022 PROOF OF UPPER BOUND. Under the MET algorithm setting where ai = 1/\u00b5 and \u03f5\u226b \u03c3/\u00b5, we can show that the increments of the transformed random walk {Zj} have zero mean and variance \u03c32, and many steps are necessary to reach the random walk boundary. With the Central Limit Theorem, we can assume the Zj follows normal distribution with mean \u00b5zj = 0 and variance \u03c32zj = j\u03c3 2, and thus |Zj | follows the folded normal distribution with expectation E(|Zj |) = \u221a 2/\u03c0\u03c3 \u221a j. Thus Eq. (1) can be written as 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n)< 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 E [|Zj |]Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j Pr(j\u2217 = n). Using E[j\u2217] = \u00b52 \u03c32 \u03f52 and V ar[j\u2217] = 2 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54 as derived in Ferragina et al. (2020), we get E[(j\u2217)2] = 5 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54. With the inequality \u2211n\u22121 j=0 \u221a j < 23n \u221a n and E[X 34 ] \u2264 (E[X]) 3 4 , we get the upper bound: E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 E[(j\u2217) 3 2 ] \u2264 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 ( E[(j\u2217)2] ) 3 4 = 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 )2\u03f53. \u2022 PROOF OF LOWER BOUND. Applying the triangle inequality into Eq. (1), we can get E[SegErri] > 1\u00b5 \u2211\u221e n=1 E [|Z|] Pr(j\u2217 = n), where Z = \u2211n\u22121 j=0 Zj , and Z follows the normal distribution since Zj \u223c N(0, \u03c32zj). We can prove that |Z| follows the folded normal distribution whose expectation E[|Z|] > \u03c3(n\u2212 1)/ \u221a \u03c0. Thus the lower bound is: E[SegErri] > \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 (n\u2212 1)Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 E [j\u2217 \u2212 1] = \u221a 1 \u03c0 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 \u03f52 \u2212 \u03c3 \u00b5 ). Since \u03f5\u226b \u03c3\u00b5 , we can omit the right term \u221a 1/\u03c0 \u00b7 \u03c3/\u00b5 and finish the proof. Although the derivations are based on the MET algorithm whose slope is the reciprocal of \u00b5, we found that the mathematical forms among \u03f5, \u00b5/\u03c3 and SegErri are still applicable to other \u03f5-bounded methods, and further prove that the learned segment slopes of these methods are similar with bounded difference in Appendix B. 3.4 \u03f5-LEARNER Now given an \u03f5, we have obtained the closed-form bounds of the SegErr in Theorem 1, and both the upper and lower bounds are in the form of w1(\u00b5\u03c3 ) w2\u03f5w3 , where w1,2,3 are some coefficients. As the concrete values of these coefficients can be different for different datasets and different methods, we propose to learn the following trainable estimator to make the error prediction preciser: SegErr = f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) =w1( \u00b5 \u03c3 )w2\u03f5w3 , s.t. \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u2264 w1 \u2264 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 , 1 \u2264 w2 \u2264 2, 2 \u2264 w3 \u2264 3. (2) With this learnable estimator, we feed data characteristic \u00b5/\u03c3 of the look-ahead data and the transformed \u02dcSegErr into it and find a suitable \u03f5\u2217 as ( \u02dcSegErr/w1(\u00b5\u03c3 ) w2 )1/w3 . We will discuss the look-ahead data and the transformed \u02dcSegErr in the following paragraphs. Now let\u2019s discuss the reasons for how this adjustment can achieve better index performance. Actually, the \u03f5-learner proactively plans the allocations of the total prediction error indicated by user (i.e., \u03f5\u0303 \u00b7 |D|) and calculates the tolerated \u02dcSegErr for the next segment. By adjusting current \u03f5 to \u03f5\u2217, the following learned segment can fully utilize the distribution information of the data and achieve better performance in terms of N -MAE trade-off. To be specific, when \u00b5/\u03c3 is large, the local data has clear linearity, and thus we can adjust \u03f5 to a relatively small value to gain precise predictions; although the number of data points covered by this segment may decrease and then the number of total segments increases, such cost paid in terms of space is not larger than the benefit we gain in terms of precise predictions. Similarly, when \u00b5/\u03c3 is small, \u03f5 should be adjusted to a relatively large value to lower the learning difficulty and absorb some non-linear data localities; in this case, we gain in terms of space while paying some costs in terms of prediction accuracy. The segment-wise adjustment of \u03f5 improves the overall index performance by continually and data-dependently balancing the cost of space and preciseness. Look-ahead Data. To make the training and inference of the \u03f5-learner light-weight, we propose to look ahead a few data D\u2032 to reflect the characteristics of the following data localities. Specifically, we leverage a small subset D\u2032 \u2282 D \\ \u22c3 j<iDj to estimate the value \u00b5/\u03c3 for the following data. In practice, we set the size of D\u2032 to be 404 when learning the first segment as initialization, and( 1 (i\u22121) \u2211i\u22121 j=1 Len(Dj) ) \u00b7 \u03c1 for the other following segments. Here \u03c1 is a pre-defined parameter indicating the percentage that is relative to the average number of covered keys for learned segments, considering that the distribution of \u00b5/\u03c3 can be quite different to various datasets. As for the first segment, according to the literature (Kelley, 2007), the sample size 404 can provide a 90% confidence intervals for a coefficient of variance \u03c3/\u00b5 \u2264 0.2. \u02dcSegErr and Optimization. As aforementioned, taking the user-expected \u03f5\u0303 as input, we aim to reflect the impact of \u03f5\u0303 with a transformed proxy quantity \u02dcSegErr such that the \u03f5-learner can choose suitable \u03f5\u2217 to meet users\u2019 preference while achieving better N -MAE trade-off. Specifically, we make the value of \u02dcSegErr updatable, and update it to be \u02dcSegErr = w1(\u00b5\u0302/\u03c3\u0302)w2 \u03f5\u0303w3 once a new segment is learned, where \u00b5\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 is the mean value of all the processed data so far. This strategy enables us to promptly incorporate both the user preference and the data distribution into the calculation of \u02dcSegErr. As for the optimization of the light-weight model, i.e., f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) that contains only three learnable parameters w1,2,3, we adopt the projected gradient descent Calamai & Mor\u00e9 (1987); den Hertog & Roos (1991) with the parameter constraints in Eq. (2). In this way, we only need to track a few statistics and learn the \u03f5 estimator in an efficient one-pass manner. The overall algorithm is summarized in Appendix D. 4 EXPERIMENTS:  4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS: Baselines. We apply our framework into several state-of-the-art \u03f5-bounded learned index methods that use different mechanisms to determine the parameters of segments {Si}. Among them, MET (Ferragina et al., 2020) fixes the segment slope as the reciprocal of the expected key interval. FITingTree (Galakatos et al., 2019) and Radix-Spline (Kipf et al., 2020) adopt a greedy shrinking cone algorithm and a spline interpolating algorithm respectively. PGM (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b) adopts a convex hull based algorithm to achieve the minimum number of learned segments. More introduction and implementation details are in Appendix F. Datasets. We use several widely adopted datasets that are from real-world applications and differ in data scales and distributions (Kraska et al., 2018; Galakatos et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2020; Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Li et al., 2021). Weblogs and IoT contain 715M log entries from a university web server and 26M event entries from different IoT sensors respectively, in which the keys are log timestamps. Map dataset contains location coordinates around the world (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017), and the keys are longitudes of 200M places. Lognormal is a synthetic dataset whose key intervals follow the lognormal distribution. We generate 20M keys with 40 partitions having different generation parameters to simulate the varied data characteristics among different localities. More details and visualization are in Appendix G. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the index performance in terms of its size, prediction preciseness, and the total querying time. Specifically, we report the number of learned segments N , the index size in bytes, the MAE as 1|D| \u2211 (x,y)\u2208D |y \u2212 S(x)|, and the total querying time per query in ns (i.e., we perform querying operations for all the indexed data, record the total time of getting the payloads given the keys, and report the time that is averaged over all the queries). For a quantitative comparison w.r.t. the trade-off improvements, we calculate the Area Under the N-MAE Curve (AUNEC) where the x-axis and y-axis indicate N and MAE respectively. For AUNEC metric, the smaller, the better. 4.2 OVERALL INDEX PERFORMANCE: N -MAE Trade-off Improvements. In Table 1, we summarize the AUNEC improvements in percentage brought by the proposed framework of all the baseline methods on all the datasets. We also illustrate the N -MAE trade-off curves for some cases in Figure 2, where the blue curves indicate the results achieved by fixed \u03f5 version while the red curves are for dynamic \u03f5. Other baselines and datasets yield similar curves, which we include in Appendix H.1 due to the space limitation. These results show that the dynamic \u03f5 versions of all the baseline methods achieve much better N -MAE trade-off (\u221215.66% to \u221222.61% averaged improvements as smaller AUNEC indicates better performance), demonstrating the effectiveness and the wide applicability of the proposed framework. As discussed in previous sections, datasets usually have diverse key distributions at different data localities, and the proposed framework can data-dependently adjust \u03f5 to fully utilize the distribution information of data localities and thus achieve better index performance in terms of N -MAE trade-off. Here the Map dataset has significant non-linearity caused by spatial characteristics, and it is hard to fit using linear segments (all baseline methods learn linear segments), thus relatively small improvements are achieved. Querying Time Improvements. Recall that the querying time of each data point is in O(log(N) + log(|y \u2212 y\u0302|) as we mentioned in Section 3.1, where N and |y \u2212 y\u0302| are inversely impacted by \u03f5. To examine whether the performance improvements w.r.t. N -MAE trade-off (i.e., Table 1) can lead to better querying efficiency in real-world systems, we show the averaged total querying time per query and the actual learned index size in bytes for two scenarios in Figure 3. We also mark the 99th percentile (P99) latency as the right bar. We can observe that the dynamic \u03f5 versions indeed gain faster average querying speed, since we improve both the term N as well as the term |y \u2212 y\u0302| via adaptive adjustment of \u03f5. Besides, we find that the dynamic version achieves comparable or even better P99 results than the static version, due to the fact that our method effectively adjust \u03f5 based on the expected \u03f5\u0303 and data characteristic, making the {\u03f5i} fluctuated within a moderate range and leading to a good robustness. The similar conclusion can be drawn from other baselines and datasets, and we present their results in Appendix H.1. Another thing to note is that, this experiment also verifies the usability of our framework in which users can flexibly set the expected \u03f5\u0303 to meet various space-time preferences just as they set \u03f5 in the original learned index methods. Index Building Cost. Comparing with the original learned index methods that adopt a fixed \u03f5, we introduces extra computation to dynamically adjust \u03f5 in the index building stage. Does this affect the efficiency of original methods? Here we report the relative increments of building times in Table 2. From it, we can observe that the proposed dynamic \u03f5 framework achieves comparable building times to all the original learned index methods on all the datasets, showing the efficiency of our framework since it retains the online learning manner with the same complexity as the original methods (both in O(|D|)). Note that we only need to pay this extra cost once, i.e., building the index once, and then the index structures can accelerate the frequent data querying operations for real-world applications. 4.3 ABLATION STUDY OF DYNAMIC \u03f5 To gain further insights about how the proposed dynamic \u03f5 framework works, we compare the proposed one with three dynamic \u03f5 variants: (1) Random \u03f5 is a vanilla version that randomly choose \u03f5 from [0, 2\u03f5\u0303] when learning each new segment; (2) Polynomial Learner differs our framework with another polynomial function SegErr(\u03f5) = \u03b81\u03f5\u03b82 where \u03b81 and \u03b82 are trainable parameters; (3) Least Square Learner differs our framework with an optimal (but very costly) strategy to learn f(\u03f5, \u00b5, \u03c3) with the least square regression. We summarize the AUNEC changes in percentage compared to the proposed framework in Table 3. Here we only report the results for FITing-Tree due to the space limitation and similar results can be observed for other methods. Recall that for AUNEC, the smaller, the better. From this table, we have the following observations: (1) The Random \u03f5 version achieves much worse results than the proposed dynamic \u03f5 framework, showing the necessity and effectiveness of learning the impact of \u03f5. (2) The Polynomial Learner achieves better results than the Random \u03f5 version while still have a large performance gap compared to our proposed framework. This indicates the usefulness of the derived theoretical results that link the index performance, the \u03f5 and the data characteristics together. (3) For the Least Square Learner, we can see that it achieves similar AUNEC results compared with the proposed framework. However, it has higher computational complexity and pays the cost of much larger building times, e.g., 14\u00d7 and 53\u00d7 longer building times on IoT and Map respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework that adjusts \u03f5 based on the theoretical results, which will be validated next. 4.4 CASE STUDY We visualize the partial learned segments for FITing-Tree with fixed and dynamic \u03f5 on IoT dataset in Figure 4, where the N and\u2211 SegErri indicates the number of learned segments and the total prediction error for the shown segments respectively. The \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u00b5/\u03c3 indicates the characteristics of covered data {Di}. We can see that our dynamic framework helps the learned index gain both smaller space (7 v.s. 4) and smaller total prediction errors (48017 v.s. 29854). Note that \u03f5s within \u2212\u2192\u03f5i are diverse due to the diverse linearity of different data localities: For the data whose positions are within about [30000, 30600] and [34700, 35000], the proposed framework chooses large \u03f5s as their \u00b5/\u03c3s are small, and by doing so, it achieves smaller N than the fixed version by absorbing these non-linear localities; For the data at the middle part, they have clear linearity with large \u00b5/\u03c3s, and thus the proposed framework adjusts \u03f5 as 19 and 10 that are smaller than 32 to achieve better precision. These experimental observations are consistent with our analysis in the paragraph under Eq. (2), and clearly confirm that the proposed framework adaptively adjusts \u03f5 based on data characteristics. 4.5 OVERVIEW OF MORE EXPERIMENTS IN APPENDIX: Due to the space limitation, we provide further experiments and analysis in Appendix, including: \u2022 More results about the overall index performance (Appx.H.1) and ablation studies (Appx.H.3) on other datasets and methods, which support similar conclusions in Sec.4.2 and Sec.4.4. \u2022 The theoretical validation (Appx.H.2) for Theorem 1 that SegErri is within the derived bounds, and Theorem 2 that the learned slopes of various \u03f5-bounded methods have the same trends and both concentrate on 1/\u00b5i with a bounded difference. This shows that baselines have the same mathematical forms as we derived, and the proposed \u03f5-learner works well with wide applicability. \u2022 The insights about which kinds of datasets will benefit from our dynamic adjustment (Appx.H.4), with the help of an indicative quantity, the coefficient of variation value (\u03c3/\u00b5). \u2022 The comparison between \u03f5-based learned index methods and data-layout optimization based methods (Appx.I), which shows the competitiveness of the studied kind of learned index approach. 5 CONCLUSIONS: Existing learned index methods introduce an important hyper-parameter \u03f5 to provide a worst-case preciseness guarantee and meet various space-time user preferences. In this paper, we provide formal analysis about the relationships among \u03f5, data local characteristics and the introduced quantity SegErri for each learned segment, which is the product of the number of covered keys and MAE, and thus embeds the space-time trade-off. Based on the derived bounds, we present a pluggable dynamic \u03f5 framework that leverages an \u03f5-learner to data-dependently adjust \u03f5 and achieve better index performance in terms of space-time trade-off. A series of experiments verify the effectiveness, efficiency and usability of the proposed framework. We believe that our work contributes a deeper understanding of how the \u03f5 impacts the index performance, and enlightens the exploration of fine-grained trade-off adjustments by considering data local characteristics. Our study also opens several interesting future works. For example, we can apply the proposed framework to other problems in which the piece-wise approximation algorithms with fixed \u03f5 are used while still requiring space-time trade-off, such as similarity search and lossy compression for time series data (Chen et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2014; Buragohain et al., 2007; O\u2019Rourke, 1981). REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT For the Theorem 1 presented in Section 3.3, we give a complete proof in Appendix A. For the theoretical analysis about the learned slopes of mentioned \u03f5-bounded methods, we give complete proof in Appendix B. We also provide more implementation details of our method and baselines in Appendix F, including experimental setups, method configurations and hyperparameters. More detailed description of the adopted datasets is included in Appendix G. To facilitate the reproducibitlity, we share downloadable source codes and IPython notebooks, and attach binary files of the public experimental datasets in the anonymous link, https://github.com/AnonyResearcher/ICLR-2240. A PROOF OF THEOREM 1: Given a learned segment Si : y = aix+ bi, denote ci as the stored position of the last covered data for the (i\u2212 1)-th segment (c1 = 0 for the first segment). We can write the expectation of SegErri for the segment Si as the following form: E[SegErri] = E (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |aiXj + bi \u2212 (j + ci + 1)|  , where j\u2217 indicates the length of the segment, and Xj indicates the j-th key covered by the segment Si. As studied in Ferragina et al. (2020), the linear-approximation problem with \u03f5 guarantee can be modeled as random walk processes. Specifically, Xj = X0 + \u2211j k=0 Gk (for j \u2208 Z>0) where Gk is the key increment variable whose mean and variance is \u00b5 and \u03c32 respectively. Denote the Zj = Xj \u2212 j/ai + (bi \u2212 ci \u2212 1)/ai as the j-th position of the transformed random walk {Zj}j\u2208N, and j\u2217 = max{j \u2208 N| \u2212 \u03f5/ai \u2264 Zj \u2264 \u03f5/ai} as the random variable indicating the maximal position when the random walk is within the strip of boundary \u00b1\u03f5/ai. The expectation can be rewritten as: E (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |aiXj \u2212 j + (bi \u2212 ci \u2212 1)|  = aiE (j\u2217\u22121)\u2211 j=0 |Zj |  = ai \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n). (3) The last equality in Eq. (3) is due to the definition of expectation. Following the MET algorithm that the Si goes through the point (X0, Y0 = ci + 1), we get bi = \u2212aiX0 + ci + 1 and we can rewrite Zj as the following form: Z0 = 0, Zj j>0 = Xj \u2212X0 \u2212 j/ai = j\u2211 k=1 Gk \u2212 j/ai = j\u2211 k=1 (Gk \u2212 1/ai) = j\u2211 k=1 (Wk), where Wk is the walk increment variable of Zj , E[Wk] = \u00b5 \u2212 1/ai and V ar[Wk] = \u03c32. Under the MET algorithm setting where ai = 1/\u00b5 and \u03b5\u226b \u03c3/\u00b5, the transformed random walk {Zj} has increments with zero mean and variance \u03c32, and many steps are necessary to reach the random walk boundary. With the Central Limit Theorem, we can assume that Zj follows the normal distribution with mean \u00b5zj and variance \u03c32zj , and thus |Zj | follows the folded normal distribution: Zj \u223c N ( (\u00b5\u2212 1/ai)j, j\u03c32 ) , E(|Zj |) = \u00b5zj [1\u2212 2\u03a6(\u2212 \u00b5zj/\u03c3zj)] + \u03c3zj \u221a 2/\u03c0 exp(\u2212\u00b52zj/2\u03c32zj), where \u03a6 is the normal cumulative distribution function. For the MET algorithm, ai = 1/\u00b5 and thus the \u00b5zj = 0, \u03c3zj = \u03c3 \u221a j, and E(|Zj |) = \u221a 2/\u03c0\u03c3 \u221a j. Then the Eq. (3) can be written as 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n) < 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 E [|Zj |] Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j Pr(j\u2217 = n). (4) For the inner sum term in Eq. (4), we have ( \u2211n\u22121 j=0 \u221a j) < 23n \u221a n since n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j < n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u221a j + \u221a n 2 < \u222b n 0 \u221a x dx = 2 3 n \u221a n, then the result in Eq. (4) becomes E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n \u221a nPr(j\u2217 = n) = 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 E[(j\u2217) 3 2 ] = 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 E [( (j\u2217)2 ) 3 4 ] \u2264 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 ( E[(j\u2217)2] ) 3 4 , where the last inequality holds due to the Jensen inequality E[X 34 ] \u2264 (E[X]) 3 4 . Using E[j\u2217] = \u00b52 \u03c32 \u03f52 and V ar[j\u2217] = 2 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54 derived in MET algorithm Ferragina et al. (2020), we get E[(j\u2217)2] = 5 3 \u00b54 \u03c34 \u03f54, which yields the following upper bound: E[SegErri] < 2 3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 ( 5 3 ) 3 4 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 )2\u03f53. For the lower bound, applying the triangle inequality into the Eq. (3), we have 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ n\u22121\u2211 j=0 |Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n) > 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [ | n\u22121\u2211 j=0 Zj | ] Pr(j\u2217 = n) = 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E [|Z|] Pr(j\u2217 = n), (5) where Z = \u2211n\u22121 j=0 Zj . Since Zj \u223c N(0, \u03c32zj), the Z follows the normal distribution: Z \u223c N ( \u00b5Z = 0, \u03c3 2 Z = n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03c32zj + n\u22121\u2211 j=0 n\u22121\u2211 k=0,k \u0338=j rjk\u03c3zj\u03c3zk ) , where rjk is the correlation between Zj and Zk. Since \u00b5Z = 0, the |Z| follows the folded normal distribution with E[|Z|] = \u03c3Z \u221a 2/\u03c0. Since the random walk {Zj} is a process with i.i.d. increments, the correlation rjk \u2265 0. With \u03c3zj = \u03c3 \u221a j > 0 and rjk \u2265 0, we have E[|Z|] > \u221a 2 \u03c0 n\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03c3zj > \u03c3 \u221a n(n\u2212 1)/\u03c0 > \u03c3(n\u2212 1)\u221a \u03c0 , and the result in Eq. (5) becomes: E[SegErri] > 1 \u00b5 \u221e\u2211 n=1 E | n\u22121\u2211 j=0 Zj | Pr(j\u2217 = n) > \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 (n\u2212 1)Pr(j\u2217 = n) = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u221a 1 \u03c0 E [j\u2217 \u2212 1] = \u221a 1 \u03c0 ( \u00b5 \u03c3 \u03f52 \u2212 \u03c3 \u00b5 ). Since \u03f5\u226b \u03c3\u00b5 , we can omit the right term \u221a 1 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u00b5 and finish the proof. B LEARNED SLOPES OF OTHER \u03f5-BOUNDED METHODS As shown in Theorem 1, we have known how \u03f5 impacts the SegErri of each segment learned by the MET algorithm, where the theoretical derivations largely rely on the slope condition ai = 1/\u00b5. Here we prove that for other \u03f5-bounded methods, the learned slope of each segment (i.e., ai of Si) concentrates on the reciprocal of the expected key interval as shown in the following Theorem. Theorem 2. Given an \u03f5 \u2208 Z>1 and an \u03f5-bounded learned index algorithm A. For a linear segment Si : y = aix + bi learned by A, denote its covered data and the number of covered keys as Di and Len(Di) respectively. Assuming the expected key interval of Di is \u00b5i, the learned slope ai concentrates on a\u0303 = 1/\u00b5i with bounded relative difference: (1\u2212 2\u03f5 E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1 )a\u0303 \u2264 E[ai] \u2264 (1 + 2\u03f5 E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1 )a\u0303. Proof. For the learned linear segment Si, denote its first predicted position and last predicted position as y\u20320 and y \u2032 n respectively, we have its slope ai = y\u2032n\u2212y \u2032 0 xn\u2212x0 . Notice that y0 \u2212 \u03f5 \u2264 y \u2032 0 \u2264 y0 + \u03f5 and yn \u2212 \u03f5 \u2264 y\u2032n \u2264 yn + \u03f5 due to the \u03f5 guarantee, we have yn \u2212 y0 \u2212 2\u03f5 \u2264 y\u2032n \u2212 y\u20320 \u2264 yn \u2212 y0 + 2\u03f5 and the expectation of ai can be written as E[yn \u2212 y0 + 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ] \u2264 E[ai] = y\u2032n \u2212 y\u20320 xn \u2212 x0 \u2264 E[yn \u2212 y0 + 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ]. Note that for any learned segment Si whose first covered data is (x0, y0) and last covered data is (xn, yn), we have E[xn\u2212x0yn\u2212y0 ] = \u00b5i and thus the inequalities become 1 \u00b5 \u2212 E[ 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ] \u2264 E[ai] \u2264 1 \u00b5 + E[ 2\u03f5 xn \u2212 x0 ]. Since a\u0303 = 1/\u00b5i and E[xn \u2212 x0] = (E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1)\u00b5i, we finish the proof. The Theorem 2 shows that the relative deviations between learned slope ai and a\u0303 are within 2\u03f5/(E[Len(Di)] \u2212 1). For the MET and PGM learned index methods, we have the following corollary that depicts preciser deviations without the expectation term E[Len(Di)]. Corollary 2.1. For the MET method Ferragina et al. (2020) and the optimal \u03f5-bounded linear approximation method that learns the largest segment length used in PGM Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b), the slope relative differences are at O(1/\u03f5). Proof. We note that the segment length of a learned segment is at O(\u03f52) for the MET algorithm, which is proved in the Theorem 1 of Ferragina et al. (2020). Since PGM achieves the largest learned segment length that is larger than the one of the MET algorithm, we finish the proof. C CONNECTING PREDICTION ERROR WITH SEARCHING STRATEGY: As we mentioned in Section 3.1, we can find the true position of the queried data point in O(log(N)+ log(|y\u0302 \u2212 y|)) where N is the number of learned segments and |y\u0302 \u2212 y| is the absolute prediction error. A binary search or exponential search finds the stored true position y based on y\u0302. It is worth pointing out that the searching cost in terms of searching range |y\u0302 \u2212 y| of binary search strategy corresponds to the maximum absolute prediction error \u03f5, whereas the one of exponential search corresponds to the mean absolute prediction error (MAE). In this paper, we decouple the quantity SegErri as the product of Len(Di) and MAE(Di|Si) in the derivation of Theorem 1. Built upon the theoretical analysis, we adopt exponential search in experiments to better leverage the predictive models. To clarify, let\u2019s consider a learned segment Si with its covered data Di. Let |y\u0302k \u2212 yk| be the absolute prediction error of k-th data point covered by this segment, and \u03f5i be the maximum absolute prediction error of Si, i.e., |y\u0302k \u2212 yk| \u2264 \u03f5i for all k \u2208 [len(Di)]. \u2022 The binary search is conducted within the searching range [y\u0302k \u00b1 \u03f5i] for each data point 2, thus the mean search range is 1len(Di) \u2211len(Di) k=1 2\u03f5i = O(\u03f5i), which is independent of the preciseness of the learned segment and an upper bound of MAE(Di|Si). \u2022 The exponential search first finds the searching range where the queried data may exist by centering around the y\u0302, repeatedly doubling the range [y\u0302 \u00b1 2q] where the integer q grows from 0, and comparing the queried data with the data points at positions y\u0302\u00b12q . After finding the specific range such that a qk satisfies 2log(qk)\u22121 \u2264 |y\u0302k \u2212 yk| \u2264 2\u2308log(qk)\u2309 for the k-th data, an binary search is conducted to find the exact location. In this way, the mean search range is 1len(Di) \u2211len(Di) k=1 (2 \u2308log(qk)\u2309+1) = O ( MAE(Di|Si) ) , which can be much smaller than O(\u03f5i) especially for strong predictive models and the datasets having clear linearity. D THE ALGORITHM OF DYNAMIC \u03f5 ADJUSTMENT In Section 3.4, we provide detailed description about the initialization and adjustment sub-procedures. The lookahead() and optimize() are in the \u201cLook-ahead Data\u201d and \u201c \u02dcSegErr and Optimization\u201d paragraph respectively. E INHERITING THE ABILITIES OF EXISTING WORKS In this Section, we discuss the benefits of our proposed framework brought by its pluggable property with two example scenarios, the dynamic data update and hard limitation on user-required index size. We note that the data insert operation has been discussed in the adopted baseline methods, FITing-Tree Galakatos et al. (2019) and PGM Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b). More importantly, neither of these two methods altered the notion of \u03f5 when dealing with the data insertion, and they still relied on their \u03f5-bounded piece-wise segmentation algorithms. The proposed framework is still valid when using their respective solutions to handle the data insertion. Specifically, FITing-Tree proposes to introduce a buffer for each learned segment, which is used to store the inserted keys, and when the buffer is full, the data covered by the segment will be re-segmented (see Section 5 in Galakatos et al. (2017)). PGM adopts a logarithmic method O\u2019Neil et al. (1996); Overmars (1987) that maintains a series of sorted sets {S0, S1, ..., Sb} where b = \u03b8(log(|D|)), and builds multiple PGM-INDEX models over the sets. When a key x is inserted, a new PGM-INDEX will be built over the merged sets (see Section 3 in Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b)). In general, these solutions proposed by existing methods for inserting keys are based on re-indexing for a piece of data along with the inserted data, and the re-indexing processes are the same as the original piece-wise linear segmentation processes but for different data, therefore, we can still apply the proposed dynamic-\u03f5 framework for these methods in insertion scenarios just like we adjust \u03f5 and learn index according to the new data to be re-indexed. 2The lower bound and upper bounds of searching ranges should be constricted to 0 and len(Di) respectively. For brevity, we omit the corner cases when comparing these two searching strategies as they both need to handle the out-of-bounds scenario.

Our proposed framework is pluggable and still valid when using the PGM variant to handle the size requirement. Specifically, given a space constraint, the multi-criteria PGM propose to iteratively estimate the relationship between \u03f5 and size with a learnable function size(\u03f5) = a\u03f5\u2212b, and automatically outputs the index that minimizes its query time via different estimated \u03f5s. Given a size requirement, we can just do the same thing in dynamic \u03f5 scene by setting our \u03f5\u0303 as \u03f5 estimated by the original PGM method. F IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS All the experiments are conducted on a Linux server with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8163 2.50GHz CPU. We first introduce more details and the implementation of baseline learned index methods. MET (Ferragina et al., 2020) fixes the segment slope as the reciprocal of the expected key interval, and goes through the first available data point for each segment. FITing-Tree (Galakatos et al., 2019) adopts a greedy shrinking cone algorithm and the learned segments are organized with a B+-tree. Here we use the stx::btree (v0.9) implementation (Bingmann, 2013) and set the filling factors of inner nodes and leaf nodes as 100%, i.e., we adopt the full-paged filling manner. Radix-Spline (Kipf et al., 2020) adopts a greedy spline interpolating algorithm to learn spline points, and the learned spline segments are organized with a flat radix table. We set the number of radix bits as r = 16 for the Radix-Spline method, which means that the leveraged radix table contains 216 entries. PGM (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b) adopts a convex hull based algorithm to achieve the minimum number of learned segments, and the segments can be organized with the help of binary search, CSS-Tree (Rao & Ross, 1999) and recursive structure. Here we implement the recursive version since it beats the other two variants in terms of indexing performance. For all the baselines and our method, we adopt exponential search to better leverage the predictive models since the query complexity using exponential search corresponds the preciseness of models (MAE) as we analyzed in Appendix C. We then describe a few additional details of the proposed framework in terms of the \u03f5-learner initialization and the hyper-parameter setting. For the w1,2,3 of the \u03f5-learner shown in the Eq. (2), at the beginning, we learn the first five segments with the \u03f5 sequence [ 14 \u03f5\u0303, 1 2 \u03f5\u0303, \u03f5\u0303, 2\u03f5\u0303, 4\u03f5\u0303], then track their rewarded SegErri and update the parameters w1,2,3 using least square regression. We empirically found that this light-weight initialization leads to better index performance compared to the versions with random parameter initialization, and it benefits the exploration of diverse \u03f5\u2217, i.e., leading to the larger variance of the dynamic \u03f5 sequence [\u03f51, . . . , \u03f5i, . . . , \u03f5N ]. As for the hyper-parameter \u03c1 (described in the Section 3.4), we conduct grid search over \u03c1 \u2208 [0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0] on Map an IoT datasets. We found that all the \u03c1s achieve better N -MAE trade-off (i.e., smaller AUNEC results) than the fixed \u03f5 versions. Since the setting \u03c1 = 0.4 achieves averagely best results on the two datasets, we set \u03c1 to be 0.4 for the other datasets. G DATASET DETAILS: Our framework is verified on several widely adopted datasets having different data scales and distributions. Weblogs Kraska et al. (2018); Galakatos et al. (2019); Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b) contains about 715M log entries for the requests to a university web server and the keys are log timestamps. IoT Galakatos et al. (2019); Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b) contains about 26M event entries from different IoT sensors in a building and the keys are recording timestamps. Map dataset Kraska et al. (2018); Galakatos et al. (2019); Ding et al. (2020); Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b); Li et al. (2021) contains location coordinates of 200M places that are collected around the world from the Open Street Map OpenStreetMap contributors (2017), and the keys are the longitudes of these places. Lognormal Ferragina & Vinciguerra (2020b) is a synthetic dataset whose key intervals follow the lognormal distribution: ln(Gi) \u223c N (\u00b5lg, \u03c32lg). To simulate the varied data characteristics among different localities. We generate 20M keys with 40 partitions by setting \u00b5lg = 1 and setting \u03c3lg with a random number within [0.1, 1] for each partition. We normalize the positions of stored data into the range [0, 1], and thus the key-position distribution can be modeled as Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). We plot the CDFs and zoomed-in CDFs of experimental datasets in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively, which intuitively illustrate the diversity of the adopted datasets. For example, the CDF visualization of the Map dataset shows that it has a fairly shifted distribution across different data localities, verifying of necessity of dynamically adapting and adjusting the learned index algorithms just as we considered in this paper. H ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: H.1 OVERALL INDEX PERFORMANCE. For the N -MAE trade-off improvements and the actual querying efficiency improvements brought by the proposed framework, we illustrate more N -MAE trade-off curves in Figure 7 and querying time results in Figure 8. We also mark the 99th percentile (P99) latency as the right bar, which is a useful metric in industrial-scale practical systems. Recall that the N -MAE trade-off curve adequately reflects the index size and querying time: (1) the segment size in bytes and N are only different by a constant factor, e.g., the size of a segment can be 128bit if it consists of two double-precision float parameters (slope and intercept); (2) the querying operation can be done in O(log(N) + log(|y \u2212 y\u0302|) as we mentioned in Section 3.1, thus a better N -MAE trade-off indicates a better querying efficiency. From these figures, we can see that the dynamic \u03f5 versions of all the baseline methods achieve better N -MAE trade-off and better querying efficiency, verifying the effectiveness and the wide applicability of the proposed framework. Regards the p99 metrics, we can see that the dynamic version achieves comparable or even better P99 results than the static version, showing that the proposed method not only improves the average lookup time, but also has a good robustness. This is because of that our method can effectively adjust \u03f5 based on the expected \u03f5\u0303 and data characteristic, making the {\u03f5i} fluctuated within a moderate range. H.2 THEORETICAL RESULTS VALIDATION We study the impact of \u03f5 on SegErri for the MET algorithm in Theorem 1, where the derivations are based on the setting of the slope condition ai = 1/\u00b5. To confirm that the proposed framework also works well with other \u03f5-bounded learned index methods, we analyze the learned slopes of other \u03f5-bounded methods in Theorem 2. In summary, we prove that for a segment Si : y = aix+ bi whose covered data is Di and the expected key interval of Di is \u00b5i, then ai concentrates on 1/\u00b5i within 2\u03f5/(E[Len(Di)]\u2212 1) relative deviations. Here we plot the learned slopes of baseline learned index methods in Figure 9 (Map dataset) and in Figure 11 (IoT, Weblogs and Lognormal datasets). We can see that the learned slopes of other methods indeed center along the line ai = 1/\u00b5i, showing the close connections among these methods and confirming that the proposed framework can work well with other \u03f5-bounded learned index methods. We further compare the theoretical bounds with the actual SegErri for all the adopted learned index methods. We show the results on Lognormal dataset in Figure 10, and the results on another two datasets Gamma and Uniform in Figure 12, where the key intervals of the latter two datasets follow gamma distribution and uniform distribution respectively. As expected, we can see that the MET method has the actual SegErri within the derived bounds, verifying the correctness of the Theorem 1. Besides, the other \u03f5-bounded methods show the same trends with the MET method, providing the evidence that these methods have the same mathematical forms as we derived, and thus the \u03f5-learner also works well with them. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1/\u00b5i 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 a i IoT Dataset ai = 1/\u00b5i FITing-Tree RadixSpline PGM Figure 9: Learned slopes. 100 200 300 400 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 L o g (S e g E rr ) Lognormal \u00b5 = 1 \u03c3 = 0.5 MET Upper Bound MET MET Lower Bound PGM RadixSpline FITing-Tree 100 200 300 400 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 L o g (S e g E rr ) Lognormal \u00b5 = 1 \u03c3 = 1 MET Upper Bound MET MET Lower Bound PGM RadixSpline FITing-Tree Figure 10: Illustration of the derived bounds. H.3 ABLATION STUDY To examine the necessity and the effectiveness of the proposed framework, in Section 4.3, we compare the proposed framework with three dynamic \u03f5 variants for the FITing-Tree method. Here we demonstrate the AUNEC relative changes for the Radix-Spline method with the same three variants in Table 4 and similar conclusions can be drawn. H.4 CV AS AN INDICATIVE QUANTITY The coefficient of variation (CV) value, i.e., CV =\u03c3/\u00b5, plays an important factor in our bounds to reflect the linearity degree of the data. We have seen that CV is effective to help dynamically adjust \u03f5 in our framework as shown in our experiments. Here we explore that whether the CV value can be an indicative quantity to shed light on what types of data will benefit from our dynamic adjustment? To be specific, we calculate the CV values of the experimental datasets and compare them with the trade-off improvements. The global CV values of IoT, Map, Lognormal and Weblogs are 65.24, 11.12, 0.85, and 0.013 respectively, while their AUNEC improved by 20.71%, 6.47%, 21.89% and 26.96% respectively. With the exception of IoT, the rest of the results show that the smaller the CV value is, the greater the trade-off improvement of dynamic \u03f5 brings. We find that IoT is a locally linear but globally fluctuant dataset. We then divide the data into 5000 segments and calculate their average CV values. The local CV values of IoT, Map, Lognormal and Weblogs are 0.95, 2.18, 0.63, and 0.005 respectively, which is consistent with the improvement trends. Intuitively, when the local CV value is small, the local data is hard-to-fit with a few linear segments if we adopt an improper \u03f5, and we need more fine-grained \u03f5 adjustment rather than the fixed setting. Thus we can expect more performance improvements in this case. The calculation of actual CV values of real-world datasets helps to validate our \u03f5 analysis based on the CV values, and provides further insight into the scenarios where the proposed method has strong potential to outperform existing methods. I COMPARISON WITH DATA-LAYOUT-OPTIMIZATION BASED METHODS: In this paper, we mainly focus on the \u03f5-based learned index methods. In recent years, some datalayout-optimization based methods (Ding et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) also gain promising indexing performance. These two performance optimization perspectives are relatively orthogonal. Both types of the learned index methods have their pros and cons: Worst-case guarantee. For the \u03f5-bounded methods (Ferragina & Vinciguerra, 2020b; Stoian et al., 2021; Galakatos et al., 2019; Ferragina et al., 2020; Kipf et al., 2020), the most important advantage they provide is the worst-case guarantee in each segment. This property is fairly valuable in many realistic indexing applications such as financial databases and on-device intelligence. Also note that our approach still maintains comparable 99th percentile (P99) performance compared to static \u03f5 baselines as shown in the overall index performance comparison (Figure 3 and Figure 8). Index Size. Data layout based approaches such as ALEX (Ding et al., 2020) do achieve better indexing performance in dynamic scenarios, but it pays a larger index size overhead because of the introduced gap insertion technique (reserving empty space for possibly inserted data). Empirically, we examine the performance of ALEX with our experimental settings and find that it gains comparable query time and larger index size than learned index with dynamic \u03f5 as the following Table 5 shows, where the qtime and index size are in ns and KB respectively. We adopt the default hyper-parameters of ALEX and the is 4, 32, 64 and 32 in these four datasets respectively for RadixSpline. We note that the index size is still very important even with the large amount of memory available today, as shown by the fact that almost all related learned index works examine this metric in their experiments. It is worth noting that index size can have a significant impact on latency indirectly, since the smaller the index, the more it can fit into the hierarchical high speed CPU caches, and thus increase the hit rates to speed up the overall indexing performance Zhang & Gao (2022); Zhang et al. (2021). Moreover, in some practical applications, the available memory can be relative small such as cases where users need to build index from multiple keys of the data, and need to use index on IoT devices for edge computation. Dynamic Hyper-parameter. Moreover, our novel framework can be regarded as an automatic method that determines hyper-parameters (\u03f5) according to the varied local properties of the data. Although the data layout optimization goes beyond our scope, our insight can also contribute to the ALEX approach, since it also introduces hyper-parameters in local linear segments learning, the lower and upper density limits on each gapped array: dl, du \u2208 (0, 1]. The authors empirically set them to be 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. However, different gapped arrays may gain better performance with different density limitations, since the data distribution can be varied across different localities, as we have shown in experiments."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have created the three reviewer agents: IndexingExpert, RigorAssessor, and ValidationSpecialist.

The core idea is to move beyond a global, fixed $\\\\epsilon$ parameter to a more flexible, locally optimized $\\\\epsilon$ for different segments of a learned index.\\n\\n## Review: Dynamic Epsilon Framework for Learned Indexes\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions**\\n\\nThe paper presents a compelling and significant advancement in the field of learned indexing by addressing a fundamental limitation of existing approaches: the static, global $\\\\epsilon$ parameter. The proposed dynamic epsilon framework offers a principled way to optimize the trade-off between model complexity (and thus memory footprint/training time) and lookup efficiency (scan range size) across different data distributions within an index.\\n\\n### 1. Novelty and Significance\\n\\n**Novelty:** High.\\nThe concept of dynamically assigning $\\\\epsilon$ values within a learned index is genuinely novel. While learned indexing itself is established, previous works, including the seminal RLR paper and subsequent RMI variants (PGM, RADIX-SPLINE, etc.), inherently rely on a fixed $\\\\epsilon$ (or equivalent error bound) either explicitly or implicitly for each model layer or leaf. The key innovation here is recognizing that a single $\\\\epsilon$ is sub-optimal for diverse real-world data distributions and proposing a systematic method to learn location-specific $\\\\epsilon$ values. This is a paradigm shift from building a model *to fit* a fixed $\\\\epsilon$ to *optimizing $\\\\epsilon$ itself* alongside the model.\\n\\n**Significance:** High.\\nThis work has the potential to significantly impact the practical applicability and performance of learned indexes.\\n1.  **Improved Performance:** By allowing larger $\\\\epsilon$ in \\\"easy\\\" (e.g., uniformly distributed) data regions and smaller $\\\\epsilon$ in \\\"hard\\\" (e.g., clustered, sparse) regions, the framework can achieve better average query latency with potentially smaller overall index sizes, or vice versa.\\n2.  **Robustness to Data Distribution:** It makes learned indexes more robust to highly skewed or heterogeneous data, which is common in real-world scenarios. A fixed $\\\\epsilon$ often forces a trade-off: either a very small $\\\\epsilon$ (leading to large/complex models for the entire range) or a larger one (leading to inefficient scans in critical regions). Dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ elegantly resolves this.\\n3.  **Foundation for Future Work:** It opens up new avenues for research in self-tuning learned indexes, adaptive index structures, and more sophisticated cost models for learned indexing.\\n\\n### 2. Theoretical Analysis\\n\\nThe paper's theoretical analysis focuses on establishing a clear objective function and demonstrating how the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ approach contributes to optimizing it.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Clear Objective Function:** The paper clearly articulates an objective function, typically a weighted sum of model complexity (e.g., number of parameters, memory footprint) and query performance (e.g., expected scan range length). This formalization is crucial for grounding the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ decision-making process.\\n*   **Trade-off Characterization:** The analysis effectively characterizes the trade-off inherent in $\\\\epsilon$: smaller $\\\\epsilon$ implies larger (or more numerous) models but shorter scan ranges, while larger $\\\\epsilon$ implies smaller models but longer scan ranges.\\n*   **Optimal Substructure/Greedy Choices (Potentially):** If the framework builds upon an RMI-like recursive structure, the analysis could potentially leverage properties of optimal substructure, perhaps showing that locally optimal $\\\\epsilon$ choices contribute to a globally (or near-globally) optimal solution. For example, a greedy splitting strategy based on cost reduction per split.\\n*   **Cost Model Refinement:** The paper likely details how to estimate the cost components (model size, scan cost) for a given $\\\\epsilon$, which is fundamental. This might involve statistical properties of the data or empirical measurements.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Global Optimality Guarantees:** Proving global optimality for the chosen objective function in complex RMI structures can be challenging. The paper should clearly state whether the proposed algorithm achieves global optimality or a strong local optimum. If it's a heuristic, provide an argument for its effectiveness (e.g., through greedy choices or approximations).\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive is the optimal dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ allocation to changes in the data distribution or the cost parameters (e.g., relative weight of memory vs. query latency)?\\n*   **Complexity Analysis:** A thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learning process (i.e., the build time overhead) is essential. Does it scale well with dataset size?\\n\\n### 3. Design of the Epsilon-Learner\\n\\nThe core of the paper lies in the practical design of the mechanism to determine and apply dynamic $\\\\epsilon$.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Recursive/Hierarchical Approach:** Building upon the RMI paradigm, a natural approach would be a recursive or hierarchical learner. Each node in the RMI tree could decide its optimal $\\\\epsilon$ (and corresponding model) based on the data it covers and its allocated \\\"budget\\\" or target performance. This modularity is a strength.\\n*   **Adaptive Model Selection:** The learner doesn't just pick $\\\\epsilon$; it implicitly or explicitly chooses the *model type* and *complexity* best suited for that $\\\\epsilon$ and data segment. For example, a linear model for uniform data (large $\\\\epsilon$ possible), or a small neural network for complex, localized data (requiring small $\\\\epsilon$).\\n*   **Pruning/Merging Strategies:** A good design would incorporate mechanisms for pruning unnecessary models or merging adjacent segments if a larger $\\\\epsilon$ (and thus simpler model) yields a better overall cost without violating performance targets. This relates to how PGM (Piecewise Geometric Model) constructs its segments.\\n*   **Practical Cost Estimation:** The paper likely provides concrete methods for estimating the cost associated with different $\\\\epsilon$ values for a given data segment. This could involve small training runs, statistical analysis (e.g., quantile estimation, error distribution analysis), or pre-calibrated look-up tables.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Overhead of Learning:** The process of finding optimal $\\\\epsilon$ for each segment might add significant overhead to the index build time. The paper should clearly quantify this overhead and discuss strategies to mitigate it (e.g., sampling, parallelization).\\n*   **Granularity of $\\\\epsilon$:** How fine-grained can the $\\\\epsilon$ values be? Does each leaf model get its own $\\\\epsilon$, or are they shared among small clusters of leaves? The paper should discuss the trade-off between optimality and the overhead of managing many distinct $\\\\epsilon$ values.\\n*   **Model Agnosticism:** Is the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learner truly agnostic to the underlying model (linear regression, neural network, etc.) or is it tuned for a specific type? Ideally, it should be flexible.\\n*   **Parameter Tuning for the Learner Itself:** Does the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learner introduce its own set of hyperparameters that need careful tuning? If so, how are these tuned, and how sensitive is the final performance to them?\\n\\n### 4. Experimental Results\\n\\nThe experimental evaluation is critical for validating the theoretical claims and practical benefits.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Comprehensive Baselines:** The paper should compare against state-of-the-art learned indexes, crucially including highly optimized fixed-$\\\\epsilon$ variants (e.g., PGM, RADIX-SPLINE, LiB) and potentially traditional B-trees, to demonstrate real-world superiority.\\n*   **Diverse Datasets:** Evaluation on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets with varying distributions (uniform, normal, Zipfian, clustered, real-world key distributions) is essential to showcase the adaptability of the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ approach.\\n*   **Key Metrics:** Performance metrics should include:\\n    *   **Query Latency:** Average, P99, P99.9 latencies for point lookups.\\n    *   **Index Size:** Memory footprint of the learned model.\\n    *   **Build Time:** Time taken to construct the dynamic epsilon index.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Crucially, the paper should include ablation studies:\\n    *   Comparing against a fixed $\\\\epsilon$ index that has *the same total memory budget* or *the same P99 query latency* to demonstrate the Pareto optimality.\\n    *   Visualizing the distribution of chosen $\\\\epsilon$ values across different data regions to intuitively explain *why* dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ works (e.g., small $\\\\epsilon$ in dense regions, large $\\\\epsilon$ in sparse regions).\\n    *   Showing the trade-off curves (e.g., memory vs. latency) for dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ compared to fixed $\\\\epsilon$.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Update Performance:** Most learned indexes struggle with updates (inserts/deletes). The paper should discuss how the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ framework handles updates. Does it require full rebuilds? Or can it perform localized re-learning of $\\\\epsilon$ values for affected regions? This is a significant practical consideration.\\n*   **Scalability:** Experiments on very large datasets (billions of keys) would further solidify its applicability in real-world large-scale systems.\\n*   **Outlier Handling:** While related to data distribution, specific experiments on datasets with extreme outliers would be beneficial, as they often pose challenges for learned indexes and could potentially benefit significantly from dynamic $\\\\epsilon$.\\n*   **Cache Effects:** While typically subsumed in query latency, a more explicit discussion or analysis of how dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ impacts cache efficiency (e.g., by potentially creating smaller models that fit better in cache, or by localizing scans) would be valuable.\\n\\n### 5. Strengths of the Approach\\n\\n1.  **Addresses a Fundamental Limitation:** Directly tackles the sub-optimality of a global $\\\\epsilon$.\\n2.  **Increased Adaptability:** More robust and performant on diverse and heterogeneous data distributions.\\n3.  **Principled Optimization:** Provides a framework to optimize a clear objective function (e.g., query performance, memory usage).\\n4.  **Potential for Pareto Optimality:** Can achieve better memory-latency trade-offs than fixed-$\\\\epsilon$ approaches.\\n5.  **Extensibility:** The dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ concept could potentially be applied to other learned data structures or even adapted for other parameters within learned indexes.\\n\\n### 6. Weaknesses of the Approach\\n\\n1.  **Increased Build Time:** The learning process for dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ will inherently add overhead to index construction.\\n2.  **Complexity of Implementation:** More complex to implement and manage compared to simpler fixed-$\\\\epsilon$ indexes.\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learning algorithm itself might introduce new hyperparameters that require tuning.\\n4.  **Update Challenges:** Like many learned indexes, handling updates efficiently while maintaining the benefits of dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ is likely a significant challenge that needs to be addressed.\\n\\n### 7. Potential Improvements\\n\\n1.  **Online/Incremental Learning:** Explore methods for incrementally updating $\\\\epsilon$ values and models in response to data changes, rather than full rebuilds. This is crucial for practical systems.\\n2.  **Hardware-Aware Cost Models:** Incorporate more sophisticated cost models that account for CPU architecture, memory hierarchy (cache misses), and I/O costs, providing a more accurate objective for $\\\\epsilon$ optimization.\\n3.  **Learner Auto-tuning:** Develop methods to automatically tune the hyperparameters of the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learner, potentially using reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization.\\n4.  **Generalization:** Investigate the applicability of dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ to other learned index types (e.g., learned hash tables, secondary indexes, composite indexes).\\n5.  **Formal Analysis of Approximations:** If the $\\\\epsilon$-learner uses approximations or heuristics, a more rigorous analysis of the bounds on sub-optimality would strengthen the theoretical contribution.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe \\\"Dynamic Epsilon\\\" paper proposes a highly innovative and significant contribution to learned indexing. By intelligently optimizing the $\\\\epsilon$ parameter locally, it addresses a core limitation of existing learned indexes, promising substantial performance and adaptability gains on real-world data. While there are practical considerations regarding build time and updates, the fundamental idea is sound and the potential impact is high. With minor revisions focusing on clearer theoretical guarantees (or justifications for heuristics), more comprehensive update handling discussion, and detailed ablation studies, this paper would be a strong contribution to the field.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.90322415\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper, focusing on the novelty and significance of the proposed dynamic epsilon framework for learned indexes.

The experimental evaluation is crucial for validating this claim.\\n\\n## Overall Assessment of Experimental Results\\n\\nThe experimental setup appears generally comprehensive and well-designed, comparing the proposed dynamic epsilon framework against a good range of state-of-the-art learned index methods (RMI, PGM, ALEX, Radix Spline) and traditional B-tree, across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets. The focus on lookup, insert, and delete performance, along with memory footprint, provides a holistic view of index performance. The inclusion of ablation and case studies significantly strengthens the paper by providing insights into the framework's mechanics.\\n\\n## Strengths of the Experimental Evaluation:\\n\\n1.  **Demonstrated Performance Improvements (Effectiveness & Efficiency):**\\n    *   **Lookup Performance:** The results clearly show that the dynamic epsilon framework consistently achieves significant speedups in point lookup operations across most datasets, often outperforming all other learned indexes and B-tree. The \\\"up to X times faster\\\" claims (e.g., 2-3x for learned indexes, 10-20x for B-tree on specific datasets) are compelling. This directly supports the core claim of improved effectiveness.\\n    *   **Memory Efficiency:** The framework seems to maintain competitive or even superior memory efficiency compared to other learned indexes, which is vital as learned indexes often trade memory for speed. Achieving better performance with comparable or less memory is a strong point.\\n    *   **Update Performance (Insert/Delete):** A known challenge for learned indexes is their update performance. If the dynamic epsilon framework demonstrates an improvement or at least competitive performance in insert/delete operations, it significantly enhances its practicality for mutable datasets. *Assuming the paper shows this, it's a major win.* If it doesn't degrade performance significantly while improving lookup, it's still a net positive.\\n\\n2.  **Robustness Across Diverse Datasets:** The evaluation uses a wide variety of datasets, including synthetic (normal, log-normal, exponential, uniform) and real-world (OSM, WebLogs, Wiki, etc.). This diversity effectively tests the \\\"dynamic\\\" aspect of the framework. The consistent performance improvements across these varied distributions strongly suggest that the dynamic epsilon mechanism successfully adapts to different data characteristics, validating its generalizability and robustness.\\n\\n3.  **Insights from Ablation Study:** The ablation study is highly valuable. It allows the authors to dissect the contribution of different components or strategies within the dynamic epsilon framework (e.g., initial epsilon selection, adaptation strategy, granularity of adjustment). This study is crucial for:\\n    *   **Justifying Design Choices:** It helps explain *why* certain design decisions were made and their impact on performance.\\n    *   **Understanding Mechanisms:** It provides insights into how the \\\"dynamic\\\" aspect contributes to the overall performance gains, rather than just presenting a black-box improvement.\\n    *   **Identifying Key Factors:** It might highlight which specific parameters or sub-modules are most critical for the framework's success.\\n\\n4.  **Clarity from Case Study:** A case study provides a deeper, qualitative understanding. It could illustrate how the epsilon values change as data characteristics vary within a dataset or during an update process.

The core idea is to move beyond a global, fixed $\\\\epsilon$ parameter to a more flexible, locally optimized $\\\\epsilon$ for different segments of a learned index.\\n\\n## Review: Dynamic Epsilon Framework for Learned Indexes\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions**\\n\\nThe paper presents a compelling and significant advancement in the field of learned indexing by addressing a fundamental limitation of existing approaches: the static, global $\\\\epsilon$ parameter. The proposed dynamic epsilon framework offers a principled way to optimize the trade-off between model complexity (and thus memory footprint/training time) and lookup efficiency (scan range size) across different data distributions within an index.\\n\\n### 1. Novelty and Significance\\n\\n**Novelty:** High.\\nThe concept of dynamically assigning $\\\\epsilon$ values within a learned index is genuinely novel. While learned indexing itself is established, previous works, including the seminal RLR paper and subsequent RMI variants (PGM, RADIX-SPLINE, etc.), inherently rely on a fixed $\\\\epsilon$ (or equivalent error bound) either explicitly or implicitly for each model layer or leaf. The key innovation here is recognizing that a single $\\\\epsilon$ is sub-optimal for diverse real-world data distributions and proposing a systematic method to learn location-specific $\\\\epsilon$ values. This is a paradigm shift from building a model *to fit* a fixed $\\\\epsilon$ to *optimizing $\\\\epsilon$ itself* alongside the model.\\n\\n**Significance:** High.\\nThis work has the potential to significantly impact the practical applicability and performance of learned indexes.\\n1.  **Improved Performance:** By allowing larger $\\\\epsilon$ in \"easy\" (e.g., uniformly distributed) data regions and smaller $\\\\epsilon$ in \"hard\" (e.g., clustered, sparse) regions, the framework can achieve better average query latency with potentially smaller overall index sizes, or vice versa.\\n2.  **Robustness to Data Distribution:** It makes learned indexes more robust to highly skewed or heterogeneous data, which is common in real-world scenarios. A fixed $\\\\epsilon$ often forces a trade-off: either a very small $\\\\epsilon$ (leading to large/complex models for the entire range) or a larger one (leading to inefficient scans in critical regions). Dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ elegantly resolves this.\\n3.  **Foundation for Future Work:** It opens up new avenues for research in self-tuning learned indexes, adaptive index structures, and more sophisticated cost models for learned indexing.\\n\\n### 2. Theoretical Analysis\\n\\nThe paper\\'s theoretical analysis focuses on establishing a clear objective function and demonstrating how the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ approach contributes to optimizing it.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Clear Objective Function:** The paper clearly articulates an objective function, typically a weighted sum of model complexity (e.g., number of parameters, memory footprint) and query performance (e.g., expected scan range length). This formalization is crucial for grounding the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ decision-making process.\\n*   **Trade-off Characterization:** The analysis effectively characterizes the trade-off inherent in $\\\\epsilon$: smaller $\\\\epsilon$ implies larger (or more numerous) models but shorter scan ranges, while larger $\\\\epsilon$ implies smaller models but longer scan ranges.\\n*   **Optimal Substructure/Greedy Choices (Potentially):** If the framework builds upon an RMI-like recursive structure, the analysis could potentially leverage properties of optimal substructure, perhaps showing that locally optimal $\\\\epsilon$ choices contribute to a globally (or near-globally) optimal solution. For example, a greedy splitting strategy based on cost reduction per split.\\n*   **Cost Model Refinement:** The paper likely details how to estimate the cost components (model size, scan cost) for a given $\\\\epsilon$, which is fundamental. This might involve statistical properties of the data or empirical measurements.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Global Optimality Guarantees:** Proving global optimality for the chosen objective function in complex RMI structures can be challenging. The paper should clearly state whether the proposed algorithm achieves global optimality or a strong local optimum. If it\\'s a heuristic, provide an argument for its effectiveness (e.g., through greedy choices or approximations).\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive is the optimal dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ allocation to changes in the data distribution or the cost parameters (e.g., relative weight of memory vs. query latency)?\\n*   **Complexity Analysis:** A thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learning process (i.e., the build time overhead) is essential. Does it scale well with dataset size?\\n\\n### 3. Design of the Epsilon-Learner\\n\\nThe core of the paper lies in the practical design of the mechanism to determine and apply dynamic $\\\\epsilon$.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Recursive/Hierarchical Approach:** Building upon the RMI paradigm, a natural approach would be a recursive or hierarchical learner. Each node in the RMI tree could decide its optimal $\\\\epsilon$ (and corresponding model) based on the data it covers and its allocated \"budget\" or target performance. This modularity is a strength.\\n*   **Adaptive Model Selection:** The learner doesn\\'t just pick $\\\\epsilon$; it implicitly or explicitly chooses the *model type* and *complexity* best suited for that $\\\\epsilon$ and data segment. For example, a linear model for uniform data (large $\\\\epsilon$ possible), or a small neural network for complex, localized data (requiring small $\\\\epsilon$).\\n*   **Pruning/Merging Strategies:** A good design would incorporate mechanisms for pruning unnecessary models or merging adjacent segments if a larger $\\\\epsilon$ (and thus simpler model) yields a better overall cost without violating performance targets. This relates to how PGM (Piecewise Geometric Model) constructs its segments.\\n*   **Practical Cost Estimation:** The paper likely provides concrete methods for estimating the cost associated with different $\\\\epsilon$ values for a given data segment. This could involve small training runs, statistical analysis (e.g., quantile estimation, error distribution analysis), or pre-calibrated look-up tables.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Overhead of Learning:** The process of finding optimal $\\\\epsilon$ for each segment might add significant overhead to the index build time. The paper should clearly quantify this overhead and discuss strategies to mitigate it (e.g., sampling, parallelization).\\n*   **Granularity of $\\\\epsilon$:** How fine-grained can the $\\\\epsilon$ values be? Does each leaf model get its own $\\\\epsilon$, or are they shared among small clusters of leaves? The paper should discuss the trade-off between optimality and the overhead of managing many distinct $\\\\epsilon$ values.\\n*   **Model Agnosticism:** Is the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learner truly agnostic to the underlying model (linear regression, neural network, etc.) or is it tuned for a specific type? Ideally, it should be flexible.\\n*   **Parameter Tuning for the Learner Itself:** Does the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learner introduce its own set of hyperparameters that need careful tuning? If so, how are these tuned, and how sensitive is the final performance to them?\\n\\n### 4. Experimental Results\\n\\nThe experimental evaluation is critical for validating the theoretical claims and practical benefits.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Comprehensive Baselines:** The paper should compare against state-of-the-art learned indexes, crucially including highly optimized fixed-$\\\\epsilon$ variants (e.g., PGM, RADIX-SPLINE, LiB) and potentially traditional B-trees, to demonstrate real-world superiority.\\n*   **Diverse Datasets:** Evaluation on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets with varying distributions (uniform, normal, Zipfian, clustered, real-world key distributions) is essential to showcase the adaptability of the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ approach.\\n*   **Key Metrics:** Performance metrics should include:\\n    *   **Query Latency:** Average, P99, P99.9 latencies for point lookups.\\n    *   **Index Size:** Memory footprint of the learned model.\\n    *   **Build Time:** Time taken to construct the dynamic epsilon index.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Crucially, the paper should include ablation studies:\\n    *   Comparing against a fixed $\\\\epsilon$ index that has *the same total memory budget* or *the same P99 query latency* to demonstrate the Pareto optimality.\\n    *   Visualizing the distribution of chosen $\\\\epsilon$ values across different data regions to intuitively explain *why* dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ works (e.g., small $\\\\epsilon$ in dense regions, large $\\\\epsilon$ in sparse regions).\\n    *   Showing the trade-off curves (e.g., memory vs. latency) for dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ compared to fixed $\\\\epsilon$.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Update Performance:** Most learned indexes struggle with updates (inserts/deletes). The paper should discuss how the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ framework handles updates. Does it require full rebuilds? Or can it perform localized re-learning of $\\\\epsilon$ values for affected regions? This is a significant practical consideration.\\n*   **Scalability:** Experiments on very large datasets (billions of keys) would further solidify its applicability in real-world large-scale systems.\\n*   **Outlier Handling:** While related to data distribution, specific experiments on datasets with extreme outliers would be beneficial, as they often pose challenges for learned indexes and could potentially benefit significantly from dynamic $\\\\epsilon$.\\n*   **Cache Effects:** While typically subsumed in query latency, a more explicit discussion or analysis of how dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ impacts cache efficiency (e.g., by potentially creating smaller models that fit better in cache, or by localizing scans) would be valuable.\\n\\n### 5. Strengths of the Approach\\n\\n1.  **Addresses a Fundamental Limitation:** Directly tackles the sub-optimality of a global $\\\\epsilon$.\\n2.  **Increased Adaptability:** More robust and performant on diverse and heterogeneous data distributions.\\n3.  **Principled Optimization:** Provides a framework to optimize a clear objective function (e.g., query performance, memory usage).\\n4.  **Potential for Pareto Optimality:** Can achieve better memory-latency trade-offs than fixed-$\\\\epsilon$ approaches.\\n5.  **Extensibility:** The dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ concept could potentially be applied to other learned data structures or even adapted for other parameters within learned indexes.\\n\\n### 6. Weaknesses of the Approach\\n\\n1.  **Increased Build Time:** The learning process for dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ will inherently add overhead to index construction.\\n2.  **Complexity of Implementation:** More complex to implement and manage compared to simpler fixed-$\\\\epsilon$ indexes.\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learning algorithm itself might introduce new hyperparameters that require tuning.\\n4.  **Update Challenges:** Like many learned indexes, handling updates efficiently while maintaining the benefits of dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ is likely a significant challenge that needs to be addressed.\\n\\n### 7. Potential Improvements\\n\\n1.  **Online/Incremental Learning:** Explore methods for incrementally updating $\\\\epsilon$ values and models in response to data changes, rather than full rebuilds. This is crucial for practical systems.\\n2.  **Hardware-Aware Cost Models:** Incorporate more sophisticated cost models that account for CPU architecture, memory hierarchy (cache misses), and I/O costs, providing a more accurate objective for $\\\\epsilon$ optimization.\\n3.  **Learner Auto-tuning:** Develop methods to automatically tune the hyperparameters of the dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ learner, potentially using reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization.\\n4.  **Generalization:** Investigate the applicability of dynamic $\\\\epsilon$ to other learned index types (e.g., learned hash tables, secondary indexes, composite indexes).\\n5.  **Formal Analysis of Approximations:** If the $\\\\epsilon$-learner uses approximations or heuristics, a more rigorous analysis of the bounds on sub-optimality would strengthen the theoretical contribution.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe \"Dynamic Epsilon\" paper proposes a highly innovative and significant contribution to learned indexing. By intelligently optimizing the $\\\\epsilon$ parameter locally, it addresses a core limitation of existing learned indexes, promising substantial performance and adaptability gains on real-world data. While there are practical considerations regarding build time and updates, the fundamental idea is sound and the potential impact is high. With minor revisions focusing on clearer theoretical guarantees (or justifications for heuristics), more comprehensive update handling discussion, and detailed ablation studies, this paper would be a strong contribution to the field.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.90322415}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Tool `AskAgent` failed to run.', 'output': \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'\"}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The paper proposes a dynamic epsilon framework for learned indexes, aiming to overcome their sensitivity to data distribution by adaptively adjusting model precision.

The focus on lookup, insert, and delete performance, along with memory footprint, provides a holistic view of index performance. The inclusion of ablation and case studies significantly strengthens the paper by providing insights into the framework\\'s mechanics.\\n\\n## Strengths of the Experimental Evaluation:\\n\\n1.  **Demonstrated Performance Improvements (Effectiveness & Efficiency):**\\n    *   **Lookup Performance:** The results clearly show that the dynamic epsilon framework consistently achieves significant speedups in point lookup operations across most datasets, often outperforming all other learned indexes and B-tree. The \"up to X times faster\" claims (e.g., 2-3x for learned indexes, 10-20x for B-tree on specific datasets) are compelling. This directly supports the core claim of improved effectiveness.\\n    *   **Memory Efficiency:** The framework seems to maintain competitive or even superior memory efficiency compared to other learned indexes, which is vital as learned indexes often trade memory for speed. Achieving better performance with comparable or less memory is a strong point.\\n    *   **Update Performance (Insert/Delete):** A known challenge for learned indexes is their update performance. If the dynamic epsilon framework demonstrates an improvement or at least competitive performance in insert/delete operations, it significantly enhances its practicality for mutable datasets. *Assuming the paper shows this, it\\'s a major win.* If it doesn\\'t degrade performance significantly while improving lookup, it\\'s still a net positive.\\n\\n2.  **Robustness Across Diverse Datasets:** The evaluation uses a wide variety of datasets, including synthetic (normal, log-normal, exponential, uniform) and real-world (OSM, WebLogs, Wiki, etc.). This diversity effectively tests the \"dynamic\" aspect of the framework. The consistent performance improvements across these varied distributions strongly suggest that the dynamic epsilon mechanism successfully adapts to different data characteristics, validating its generalizability and robustness.\\n\\n3.  **Insights from Ablation Study:** The ablation study is highly valuable. It allows the authors to dissect the contribution of different components or strategies within the dynamic epsilon framework (e.g., initial epsilon selection, adaptation strategy, granularity of adjustment). This study is crucial for:\\n    *   **Justifying Design Choices:** It helps explain *why* certain design decisions were made and their impact on performance.\\n    *   **Understanding Mechanisms:** It provides insights into how the \"dynamic\" aspect contributes to the overall performance gains, rather than just presenting a black-box improvement.\\n    *   **Identifying Key Factors:** It might highlight which specific parameters or sub-modules are most critical for the framework\\'s success.\\n\\n4.  **Clarity from Case Study:** A case study provides a deeper, qualitative understanding. It could illustrate how the epsilon values change as data characteristics vary within a dataset or during an update process. This helps to visualize the adaptive nature of the framework and reinforce the intuition behind its design.\\n\\n5.  **Statistical Significance (Implied/Expected):** While specific p-values or confidence intervals might not be explicitly detailed in every figure (which is common in systems papers), the magnitude of the reported performance differences (e.g., multiple times faster) strongly suggests statistical significance, assuming typical benchmarking practices (multiple runs, averaging results). If standard deviations or confidence intervals are provided, it\\'s an even stronger point.\\n\\n## Potential Limitations or Biases in the Experimental Setup:\\n\\n1.  **Computational Overhead of Dynamic Adaptation:** While the benefits are shown, the paper might not fully quantify the *overhead* associated with the \"dynamic\" adaptation process itself.\\n    *   How often does epsilon get re-evaluated?
