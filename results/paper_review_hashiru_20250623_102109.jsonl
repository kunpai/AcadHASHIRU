The paper title is: Symmetrical SyncMap for Imbalanced General Chunking Problems\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Human brains have been proved to have unsupervised abilities to detect repetitive patterns in sequences involving texts, sounds and images (Orba\u0301n et al., 2008; Bulf et al., 2011; Strauss et al., 2015). In the field of neuroscience, part of this behavior is known as chunking. Chunking has been verified in many experiments to play an important role in a diverse range of cognitive functions (Schapiro et al., 2013; Yokoi & Diedrichsen, 2019; Asabuki & Fukai, 2020). Related to chunking problems, many sequence processing algorithms in machine learning have been proposed for time-series clustering (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015) based on similarity measurements (Figure 1(a)). Chunking sequences between state variables, however, is still underexplored (see Figure 1(b)(c)). Recently, Vargas & Asabuki (2021) proposed the first learning of chunking based solely on selforganization called SyncMap. The authors also extended chunking problems into one called Continual General Chunking Problem (CGCP), which includes problems with diverse structures that can change dynamically throughout the experiments. For the first time, SyncMap was shown not only able to uncover complex structures from sequential data, but also to adapt to continuously changing structures. It achieves this with self-organizing dynamics that maps temporal input correlations to spacial correlations, where the dynamics are always updating with negative/positive feedback loops. In this work, however, we identify problems in the original dynamics that lead to long-term instability, and we further show that performances in imbalanced CGCPs are poor given the asymmetric number of updates, i.e., the number of negative updates is much bigger than that of the positive ones. Beyond identifying these problems, here we propose Symmetrical SyncMap, which can solve both of the problems above using symmetric selection of nodes and generalized memory window. Symmetrical SyncMap solves the instability of the dynamics efficiently, and goes beyond to propose a solution to deal with imbalanced general chunking problems. As opposed to the original SyncMap that suffers from the uneven updates from positive/negative feedback loops, we propose symmetrical activation, and further introduce the concept of memory window, so that the system can have more updates from positive feedback loop while concurrently reducing the number of negative updates. In fact, the symmetrical number of updates not only compensates when imbalanced chunks are presented, but also makes the algorithm stable over the long run and reaches an equilibrium quickly in changing environments. By showing that equilibrium and self-organization can appear only with dynamical equations and without optimization/loss functions, the biggest motivation from this paper is realizing how the substantial improvements, beyond the self-organization inspiration, make the new learning paradigm very adaptive and precise. Moreover, the simplicity of the modifications here, as supported by the effectiveness in real-world scenarios of structure learning, solves the problem at the foundation, while keeping the final method concise and improving it in both accuracy and stability. 2 RELATED WORKS: Chunking. Natural neural systems are well known for the unsupervised adaptivity, since they can self-organize by many mechanisms for several purposes on many timescales (Lukos\u030cevicius, 2012). One of the mechanisms is chunking, which can be described as a biological process where the brain attains compact representation of sequences (Estes et al., 2007; Ramkumar et al., 2016). Specifically, long and complex sequences are first segmented into short and simple ones, while frequently repeated segments are concatenated into single units (Asabuki & Fukai, 2020). This can be seen as a complexity reduction for temporal information processing and associated cost (Ramkumar et al., 2016). Albeit our focus is more on neuroscience and machine learning perspectives, earlier algorithms proposed for solving chunking problems are from linguistics and include PARSER (Perruchet & Vinter, 1998). It performs well in detecting simple chunks, but fails when the probability of state transition are uniform (Schapiro et al., 2013). A neuro-inspired sequence learning model, Minimization of Regularized Information Loss (MRIL) was proposed by applying a family of competitive network of two compartment neuron models that aims to predict its own output in a type of self-supervised neuron (Asabuki & Fukai, 2020). Albeit the interesting paradigm, MRIL has been shown unstable even for problems in which it performs reasonably well. Very recently, a self-organizing learning paradigm (called SyncMap) has been proposed, which surpassed MRIL in all scenarios (Vargas & Asabuki, 2021). Time-series Clustering. Time series data is defined as a sequence of continuous, real-valued elements, usually with high dimensionality and large data size (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015). As a subroutine in unsupervised sequence processing, time-series clustering aims to uncover patterns, usually in very large sequential datasets that cannot be manually handled. This can be found in some articles applying competition-based self-organizing maps (SOMs) (Kohonen, 1990) and their variations (Vannucci & Colla, 2018; Fortuin et al., 2018), which are well-suited for clustering time series but not capable of chunking time series. In other words, these SOMs were not designed to find the underlying structures of sequences and correlation between variables, therefore, their objectives are different. A comparison of time-series clustering and sequence chunking is shown in Figure 1. Word Embeddings. In the field of natural language processing, word embedding algorithms generally transforms texts and paragraphs into vector representations (Khattak et al., 2019; Bojanowski et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018). FastText enriched the word vector with subword information (Bojanowski et al., 2017), whereas ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) aimed to represent word by contextualized word embeddings. Chunking problems presented here are related to some of them, such as a prediction-based Word2vec embedding algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013) that transforms texts into a vector space representation and can be combined with clustering to deal with chunking problems. Therefore, Word2vec is used in the experiments. Representation Learning and Communities Detection. The problem of finding probabilistic chunks refers to a random walk over a graph with several chunk structures; in which the possibility of transition to an internal state within a chunk is higher than that of transition to an external state belonging to other chunks. Such graph structures mentioned above can be seen as communities (Radicchi et al., 2004), which are most-studied by recent representation learning algorithms such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2016). More related, the Modularity Maximization (Newman & Girvan, 2004; Tang & Liu, 2009) uses eigen-decomposition performed on the modularity matrix to learn vertex representation of community. By using the adjacency matrix (transition probability matrix) to convert sequential data to graph structure, Modularity Maximization can also deal with chunking problems via random walk over the generated graphs. Although there exists newer modularity-based algorithms which try to optimize the pioneering work, such as Louvain method (Blondel et al., 2008), their objective is mostly to reduce the computational cost. Therefore, we use the original Modularity Maximization in the comparison. 3 CONTINUAL GENERAL CHUNKING PROBLEMS: Recently, a problem called Continual General Chunking Problem (CGCP) has been first proposed by Vargas & Asabuki (2021). The paper generalized various problems from neuroscience to computer science, including chunking, causal and temporal communities and unsupervised feature learning of time sequences. Such problems are considered as extracting co-occurring states from time sequences, in which the generation process (i.e., data structure) can change over time. To illustrate, the input sequences of CGCP contain state variables where each state belongs to a fixed chunk or a probabilistic chunk, transitioning by first-order Markov chain. The element of the transition matrix is given by: Pab = Pr[st+1 = b|st = a], where st is the state vector at t; and a and b are the label of states. Specifically, the fixed chunk problem (see Figure 1(d) the blue chunk) refers to the situation that the next state st+1, with respect to the current state st, is deterministic within a chunk. For example, if a and b are two continuous elements of a fixed chunk with direction a to b, then Pab = 1, \u2211 b Pab = 1. More realistically, the probabilistic chunk problem (see Figure 1(d) the orange chunk) refers to input sequences which are generated by giving a random walk over graphs. The graphs are characterized by two types of degrees: internal degree kinti and external degrees k ext i of state i. For every state, the following constrain holds: kinti > k ext i for all i \u2208 A, where A is the set of all states in sequences. The above constraint is satisfied if the graph has dense connections within chunks but sparse connections between nodes in different chunks. Beyond generalizing chunking problems to fixed and probabilistic chunks, CGCP also considers their continual variations. This is motivated by the constant adaptation observed by neural cells that can relatively switch behavior quickly in different environments (Dahmen et al., 2010). In this case, the data structure can change over time, conferring a harder albeit realistic setting. 4 SYNCMAP: SyncMap is a sole self-organization based algorithm proposed by Vargas & Asabuki (2021). It solves CGCP by creating a projected map that encodes the temporal correlation (chunks) as spatial distance between nodes. In SyncMap\u2019s dynamic, nodes which are activated together tend to be grouped as chunks, while nodes that do not activate together will be pulled away from each other. The algorithm is explained in detail in the following, with a brief example shown in Figure 2(a). Input Encoding. Consider an input sequence of state variables S = {s1, s2, ..., st, ..., s\u03c4}, where \u03c4 is the sequence length. st = {s1,t, ..., sn,t}T is a vector at time step t, and its elements si,t, i = 1, ..., n hold constrain si,t \u2208 {0, 1} : \u2211n i=1 si,t = 1, where n is the number of states. The input is encoded as an exponentially decaying vector xt = {x1,t, ..., xn,t}T having the same shape as st: xi,t = { si,ta \u2217 e\u22120.1\u2217(t\u2212ta), t\u2212 ta < m \u2217 tstep 0, otherwise (1) where ta is the last state transition to state si, and m is the state memory. Specifically, state transitions happen every tstep step (also known as time delay), and variables that have their activation period greater than m \u2217 tstep are set to 0. m and tstep are set at 2 and 10 in the original work. An example of the encoded exponentially decaying input is shown in Figure 2(a). Training Dynamic. We generate weight nodes wi,t in SyncMap\u2019s map space to obtain pair tuple (xi,t, wi,t). Nodes are first randomly initialized in a k dimensional map space. Note that weight node wi,t \u2208 Rk is a point in SyncMap\u2019s map space, and it can also be considered as a vector). In every iteration when a new input vector xt comes in, all its elements xi,t, together with the corresponding nodes wi,t, are divided into two sets according to the threshold value a: (1) activated or recently activated (positive) set PSt = {i|xi,t > a} and (2) non-recently activated (negative) set NSt = {i|xi,t \u2264 a}. The original SyncMap used a directly at 0.1. In this paper we introduce threshold value a which allows us to achieve more general state memory implementation. Inside the space, the centroids of PSt and NSt sets are calculated as follows if and only if the cardinality of both sets are greater than one in this iteration (i.e., |PSt| > 1 and |NSt| > 1): cpt= \u2211 i\u2208PSt wi,t |PSt| , cnt= \u2211 i\u2208NSt wi,t |NSt| (2) where cpt and cnt are the centroids of PSt and NSt respectively. Finally, node wi,t corresponding to each input xi,t is updated: \u03d5i,t = { 1, i \u2208 PSt 0, i \u2208 NSt , \u03b1 = { \u03b1, i \u2208 PSt \u222aNSt 0, otherwise (3) wi,t+1=wi,t+\u03b1( \u03d5i,t(cpt\u2212wi,t) ||wi,t\u2212cpt|| \u2212 (1\u2212\u03d5i,t)(cnt\u2212wi,t) ||wi,t\u2212cnt|| ) (4) where \u03b1 is the learning rate and ||\u00b7|| is the Euclidean distance. Subsequently, updated nodes are normalized to be within a hyper-sphere having radius of 10 at the end of the iteration. Clustering Phase. SyncMap forms a map during dynamic training, which has the number of nodes equal to the number of input states n. After training, DBSCAN is used (Schubert et al., 2017) for clustering with the pre-defined density parameters eps and minimum cluster mc, as it does not require the number of clusters as input. Limitations of SyncMap. Although SyncMap shows capabilities to address all kinds of CGCP, one crucial issue is the instability of its dynamic in the long term. This is due to the asymmetric number of updates with respect to positive and negative nodes. Figure 2(b) shows how this happens with an example of nine nodes in 2-D SyncMap. The fixed state memory (m = 2) results in an uneven update of positive (7) and negative (2) nodes, i.e., the dynamic\u2019s update is more influenced by negative feedback loop, which causes an undesirable convergence in the long run. 5 SYMMETRICAL SYNCMAP: Inspired by how neural efficiency influences brain activation by focusing the energy on smaller brain areas (Neubauer & Fink, 2009); here we propose an algorithm called Symmetrical SyncMap to better solve CGCP, particularly the imbalanced chunking problems. The main idea is to use symmetrical positive and negative activations. In other words, we try to reduce the number of activated negative nodes while selecting and activating more positive nodes in every iteration, thus balancing the updating rates in negative and positive feedback loops. To achieve symmetrical activation, we introduce stochastic selection and memory window. 5.1 MEMORY WINDOW: GENERALIZING THE STATE MEMORY: We introduce memory window to our algorithm by generalizing the state memory m, which allows a wider window for updates from the positive feedback loop, thus helping to capture the bigger chunks. This is achieved by tuning the threshold value a as mentioned in SyncMap\u2019s definition, i.e., any nodes wi,t having its corresponding input value xi,t greater than a will be divided into PSt set and vice versa (a true or false logical operation). With a pre-defined tstep, one can easily adjust threshold a to control the state memory m (tstep=10, a=0.05 and m=3 in Figure 3(a)). 5.2 SYMMETRICAL ACTIVATION: Symmetrical activation is the core of our proposed algorithm, where equal number of positive and negative nodes are selected to activate at each time step. We propose stochastic selection to select nodes without bias in PSt and NSt sets. Details are shown in Figure 3. Stochastically select nodes into PSt set. With a pre-defined state memory m, we first obtain the temporary PStemp set in a same way the original SyncMap obtains PSt (i.e., PStemp includes m positive nodes, and PStemp \u2286 Wt, where Wt = {wi,t|i = 1, ..., n} is the set including all nodes). Then, we apply stochastic selection to select positive nodes into PSt (i.e., a sampling process). Whether to enable stochastic selection at this particular time step is determined by a probability parameter Pr \u2208 [0, 1]. In other word, if stochastic selection were enabled, we randomly select 2 positive nodes and \u201cinhibit\u201d (ignore) other m\u2212 2 nodes in PStemp, with the probability of Pr when state memory m > 2; otherwise we select all m nodes. When m = 2, stochastic selection is not used and two most-recent states are selected. Afterwards, PSt is updated, which only includes those activated positive nodes (PSt \u2286 PStemp). Additionally, we give an analysis of Pr in Appendix F. Stochastically select nodes into NSt set. After obtaining the above PSt, we define the temporary negative set NStemp=Wt-PSt. One may notice that there is a chance that some nodes in PStemp could potentially be sampled as nodes in NStemp. This is desirable as it introduces a more uniform selection process and produces more robust results. Next, we again use the stochastic selection for sampling several negative nodes in NStemp set. The number of negative nodes being selected is symmetrically equal to the cardinality of PSt (i.e., |NSt| = |PSt|). After this step, the NSt set is updated (NSt \u2286 NStemp, see the right part of Figure 3(d) for example). The remaining steps of dynamic training follows the Equations 2 to 4. Here, we calculate a moving average of 10000 steps of nodes in the map and use the average for clustering, instead of applying DBSCAN to the map at a particular time step in the original work. An algorithmic description of the proposed algorithm is shown in Appendix G. 6 EXPERIMENTS OF CGCP PROBLEMS: We evaluate the proposed Symmetrical SyncMap with 13 tests, including (i) a long-term behavior analysis, and (ii) 12 imbalanced CGCP with fixed, probabilistic and mixed chunks, as well as their continual variations. Among the large number of clustering quality measurements, we used Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) (Studholme et al., 1999) for measurement (see Appendix A for math detail). NMI ranges between 0 and 1, and the higher the score, the better the chunking performance. We did 30 trials for each experiment. Results of NMI are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1. We used a t-test with p-value of 0.05 to verify if the best result is statistically significantly different from the others (statistical results are in Appendix H). 6.1 LONG TERM BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS EXPERIMENT: To evaluate the behavior of the algorithm over the long run, we set up this experiment. The problem considered here is a continual changing environment with ten fixed chunks, each containing six different states. Transitions between chunks happen at the end of a chunk sequence (i.e., after the sixth state variable presented inside a chunk). A chunk can transit to any other chunk with equal probability. Sequence length was set to \u03c4=600000. At time step t=0 the first environment was initialized. After t=300000 the problem changed to the second environment by re-assigning all 60 states into new ten chunks. We applied the original SyncMap and the proposed one in this experiment. We used the same parameter settings of the two models, where \u03b1=0.001*n, k=2, eps=1 and mc=2. Besides, m=3 and Pr=30% were used for Symmetrical SyncMap training. Results in Figure 4 show that Symmetrical SyncMap reaches near the optimal performance in this experiment. By applying symmetrical activation, Symmetrical SyncMap can have long-term stability while keeping NMI near 1.0. In contrast, the NMI of the original SyncMap reaches the peak near 0.88 at t=70000 and decreases constantly afterwards. After environment changes, Symmetrical SyncMap detects new chunks and reaches to a new equilibrium quickly, while the original SyncMap performs poorer and becomes unstable in the long run. 6.2 IMBALANCED CGCP PROBLEMS: Baselines and Parameter Settings. We test several imbalanced CGCP problems and their continual variations by using Symmetrical SyncMap, SyncMap, Modularity Maximization (Modularity Max), Word2vec and MRIL. In detail, Symmetrical SyncMap\u2019s parameters were set to \u03b1=0.001*n, k=3, m=3, Pr=30%, eps=4.5 and mc=2. We conducted a parameter sensitivity analysis shown in Appendix F. For the original SyncMap, we used k=3, m=2, eps=4.5 and mc=2. Regarding the Modularity Max, we first converted the input sequence to transition probability (TP) matrix, and then used the TP matrix to generate a graph for communities detection. To evaluate how a word embedding algorithm would fair in CGCP, a skip-gram Word2vec algorithm was modified to suit in the context of CGCP. Here, a latent dimension of 3 and an output layer with softmax were used, and the output size is equal to the inputs. Learning rate was set at 0.001 and batch size was 64 with a mean squared error as loss. A window of 100 steps (equivalent to 10 state transitions) was used to compute the output probability of skip-gram. Regarding the MRIL, we used 5 output neurons for all experiments, with the learning rate of 0.001. We gathered the output neurons showing correlation larger than 0.5, detecting chunks by assigning an index of groups that maximally respond to each input. The input sequences of all baselines were the same exponential decaying input as used in Symmetrical SyncMap. Problem Settings (Appendix B). We first consider several environments which consist of 3 different sizes of chunks: big, moderate and small chunks. Specifically, the big chunk has 20 state variables, while the moderate and small chunks have 10 and 5 respectively. Based on the chunk settings, we then designed three types of imbalanced problems: (i) Two big and one small chunks (20-20-5). (ii) One big, one moderate and one small chunks (20-10-5). (iii) One big and two small chunks (20-5-5). We tested these three types of imbalanced problems with three different structure settings: fixed, probabilistic and mixed chunks tests. The structures of the fixed and probabilistic environments are shown in Figure 1(d). Please refer to Figure 6 in Appendix B for the examples of the complete structures. Regarding the mixed tests, two probabilistic chunks and one fixed chunk were presented in each environment, where the order of chunks in the input sequence was specified as: 1st probabilistic to fixed to 2nd probabilistic chunk. Sequence length \u03c4 is set at 200000 for all types of test. Dynamical Continual Variation. Three dynamical variations of the above-mentioned problems were presented: continual fixed, continual probabilistic and continual mixed. Sequence length was set to 2\u03c4 . States were permuted between chunks: at time step t=0 the first type of problem was 15-15-5 (see the problem formalism in previous subsection), after t=\u03c4 the second type of problem was 20-10-5. Results Overview. The proposed algorithm Symmetrical SyncMap learns nearly the optimal solutions in all imbalanced CGCPs. It surpasses or ties other algorithms in all tests (Tables 1). Modularity Max performs the second best, in which it wins or ties the others in 2 out of 3 probabilistic CGCP tests. Word2vec achieves relatively higher NMI in probabilistic CGCPs than other problem structures, whereas MRIL performs the worst overall in all tests. The original SyncMap performs good in 20-20-5 CGCPs, yet performance decrease is witnessed as more chunks become smaller. Symmetrical SyncMap, with its inherent adaptivity, performs significantly better than all other competitive algorithms, particularly in continual variations (i.e., dynamical CGCPs where environment can change). The proposed wider memory window and symmetrical activation allow capturing states in big chunks compactly, while at the same time the stochastic selection with suitable Pr helps to separate small chunks (See the learned maps and Pr analysis in Appendices D and F), thus keeping the balance between dealing with small and big chunks. In all probabilistic CGCP tests, it produces very distinct chunks and learns the best solution (i.e., NMI=1.0). The performance downgrades slightly during the more challenging mixed CGCP tests, due to an extra imbalanced frequency issue: the fixed chunk inserted between two probabilistic chunks has lower frequency to appear in the sequences. Having said that, the proposed algorithm still outperforms the others in all mixed CGCPs with a very big lead. Original SyncMap performs relatively better in 20-20-5 type CGCPs, with the steady decrease in 20-10-5 and 20-5-5 ones. In fixed CGCPs, it makes distinct clusters for smaller chunks, yet fails to group nodes of the big chunk together. In probabilistic and mixed tests, nodes belong to smaller chunks are merged into one cluster in almost every individual trial (see Figures in Appendix D). Modularity Max shares the highest NMI score with Symmetrical SyncMap in two probabilistic CGCP tests. However, this graph-based algorithm does not perform well in other imbalanced CGCPs. A possible reason is that fixed chunks are less likely to appear in usual problems faced by Modularity Max, thus leading to a problem bias. It is worth noting that comparing the results of Modularity Max to the other algorithms in dynamical CGCPs is not fair, since a TP matrix would record all the occurrence of state variables; thus, passing a continual changing TP matrix is not inherently suitable for Modularity Max, leading to worse results in continual structures than that in static graphs. Word2vec creates maps in which nodes are more dispersed than that produced by SyncMap, thus making clustering difficult. It performs better in probabilistic chunk tests than fixed and mixed ones (see Figures in Appendix D). For the continual problems, Word2vec lacks the ability of adaptation, thus showing the overall lower NMI scores. MRIL fails to detect imbalanced chunks with large number of state variables, and therefore it performs the worst in all tests. Increasing the number of output neurons may improve the performance of fixed chunk tests. DeepWalk: Onlin L rning of Social Repres n ations Bryan Perozzi Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Rami Al-Rfou Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Steven Skiena Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science {bperozzi, ralrfou, skiena}@cs.stonybrook.edu ABSTRACT We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treat- ing walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk\u2019s latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as Blog- Catalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that Deep- Walk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk\u2019s representations can pro- vide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, Deep- Walk\u2019s representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.

INTRODUCTION The sparsity of a network representation is both a strength and a weakness. Sparsity enables the design of e cient discrete algorithms, but can make it harder to generalize in statistical learning.

The learned representation encodes community structure so it can be easily exploited by standard classification methods. Here, our method is used on Zachary\u2019s Karate network [44] to generate a latent representation in R2. Note the correspondence between community structure in the input graph and the embedding. Vertex colors represent a modularity-based clustering of the input graph. ommendation [11], anomaly detection [5], and missing link prediction [22]) must be able to deal with this sparsity in order to survive. In this paper we introduce deep learning (unsupervised feature learning) [2] techniques, which have proven successful in natural language processing, into network analysis for the first time. We develop an algorithm (DeepWalk) that learns social representations of a graph\u2019s vertices, by modeling a stream of short random walks. Social representations are latent features of the vertices that capture neighborhood similarity and community membership. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space with a relatively small number of dimensions. DeepWalk generalizes neural language models to process a special language composed of a set of randomly-generated walks. These neural language models have been used to capture the semantic and syntactic structure of human language [6], and even logical analogies [28]. DeepWalk takes a graph as input and produces a latent representation as an output. The result of applying our method to the well-studied Karate network is shown in Figure 1. The graph, as typically presented by force-directed layouts, is shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the output of our method with 2 latent dimensions. Beyond the striking similarity, we note that linearly separable portions of (1b) correspond to clusters found through modularity maximization in the input graph (1a) (shown as vertex colors).

In many cases they have a precise direction, that needs to be taken into account to understand the system as a whole. As an example we can cite predator-prey relationships in food webs. In Fig. 4 we see another example, taken from technology. The system is the World Wide Web, which can be seen as a graph by representing web pages as vertices and the hyperlinks that make users move from one page to another as edges (Albert et al., 1999). Hyperlinks are directed: if one can move from page A to page B by clicking on a hyperlink of A, one usually does not find on B a hyper- link taking back to A. In fact, very few hyperlinks (less than 10%) are reciprocal. Communities of the web graph are groups of pages having topical similarities. Detect- ing communities in the web graph may help to identify the artificial clusters created by link farms in order to enhance the PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) value of web sites and grant them a higher Google ranking. In this way one could discourage this unfair practice. One usually assumes that the existence of a hyperlink between two pages implies that they are content-related, and that this similarity is independent of the hyperlink direction.

See Appendix C for more analysis. 8 7 REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS: We study three real-world scenarios to verify the performance of Symmetrical SyncMap: (i) a network of stochastic block model (SBM); and (ii) two social network datasets with well-established community structures. For the SBM, we test a reference network introduced by Lee & Wilkinson (2019), where the network is considered as a graph which was then converted to a high-dimensional CGCP (i.e., 3 sightly imbalanced communities with a total of 90 nodes and 1192 edges). The groundtruth is defined in Appendix C. Parameter settings of all models remained the same as in previous imbalanced CGCP experiments. As shown in Table 1, both original and Symmetrical SyncMap yield the optimal solution, showing the capabilities to tackle with large-scale CGCP. We then test two well-studied benchmark networks in community detection. Hierarchical clustering was applied to replace DBSCAN in the clustering phase, to produce dendrograms for the visualization of hierarchies (i.e., by specifying the number of communities/chunks). Detailed settings and analysis for baselines are in Appendix C. NMI results are shown in Figure 5(c) with statistics. The first one is the Lusseau\u2019s network of bottlenose dolphins (Fortunato, 2010), an imbalanced structure with 2 ground-truth communities of sizes 20 and 42. Our algorithm yields a much higher NMI than other algorithms. It avoids forming dense communities produced by the original SyncMap (see Figure 5(b)(f)), allowing local relationships to be extracted, as verified in the following problem. The second problem is the Zachary\u2019s karate club network which contains 34 nodes and 78 undirected and unweighted edges. We used two sets of ground-truth: (i) 2 chunks labeled by the original paper (Zachary, 1977), and (ii) 4 chunks found through modularity-based clustering (Perozzi et al., 2014). Symmetrical SyncMap depicts the global graph structure while preserving the topology of local communities (Figure 5(e)(h)(i)). In contrast, the original SyncMap can only separate two global communities with a very dense representation (Figure 5(d)(e)). This unavoidable convergence is due to the stronger negative feedbacks over time, pulling away nodes from each community/chunk. Note that the representation learned by our method is comparable to node embeddings models with loss functions required and with more expensive training procedures such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) and Graph Convolutional Networks (Kipf & Welling, 2016). Unlike graph-based models, we achieve this by (i) mapping correlations from temporal input to a latent state space, (ii) keeping equilibrium by symmetrical activation (otherwise nodes would be locked in dense communities), and thus (iii) enabling hierarchies to be extracted from sequences. More importantly, the inherent adaptivity, as shown in previous experiments, suggests that our model a has potential usage in inductive applications, as it does not require any additional optimizations when dealing with new nodes/(sub)structures, while transductive methods such as DeepWalk cannot naturally generalize to unseen nodes or changed structures (Hamilton et al., 2017). Having said that, we argue that these real-world scenarios usually (i) have no ground-truth and (ii) are strongly biased towards standard algorithms. To illustrate, the absence of ground-truth has to do with the fact that: it is not only difficult to define the social structures, but also hard to know the existence of real chunks in nature; thus, any answer would be a guess at most. Besides, the bias is due to the output, used as ground-truth, is found by using standard algorithms in the original papers, which makes good results in real-world data more like \u201calgorithms that perform similar to standard algorithms\u201d, rather than \u201calgorithms that work with real-world data\u201d. 8 CONCLUSIONS: We propose Symmetrical SyncMap, a brain inspired self-organizing algorithm built on top of the original work to solve continual general chunking problems (CGCP). Experiments of different CGCPs have illustrated how effective the concise modifications work on those challenging tasks. By applying symmetrical activation to the dynamical equations in which loss/optimization functions are not required, our algorithm not only learns imbalanced CGCP data structures with great long-term stability and adaptivity, but also shows the potentials to uncover complex hierarchical topologies encoded in temporal sequences. This reveals the self-organizing ability of the proposed algorithm in analyzing the community structures of a broad class of temporal inputs. Future goals, advised by the results presented in this paper, will be to investigate CGCP problems with large scale, hierarchies and noisy environments, and tasks specific to representation learning in various real-world scenarios. 9 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT: We took every effort to make this work reproducible.

A DEFINITION OF NORMALIZED MUTUAL INFORMATION (NMI): Among the large number of clustering quality measurements, we used the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for measurement. Mathematically, NMI is defined as: NMI( \u02c6Y, Y ) = I(Y\u0302 ;Y ) 1 2 (H(Y\u0302 ) +H(Y )) , NMI \u2208 [0, 1] (5) where Y\u0302 and Y are the output of algorithms and the truth labels, respectively. I(Y\u0302 ;Y ) is the mutual information and H(\u2217) is the entropy. NMI ranges between 0 and 1, and the higher the score, the better the clustering performance (better correlation between Y\u0302 and Y ). B EXAMPLES OF IMBALANCED CGCPS: C ANALYSIS OF REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS Lee and Wilkinson Applied Network Science (2019) 4:122 Page 5 of 50 The group sizes can be derived from Z, and are denoted by N = (N1 N2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 NK )T . Essentially,Ni is the sum, or number of non-zero elements, of the i-th column of Z. In the example, N1 = 25, N2 = 30, N3 = 35. Finally, the K \u00d7 K edge matrix between groups can be derived from Z and Y. It is denoted by E, where Eij represents the number of edges between groups i and j in undirected graphs, and from group i to group j in directed ones. In the example, E is symmetric as G is undirected, and E11 = 245, E22 = 341, E33 = 481, E12 = E21 = 37, E23 = E32 = 52, and E31 = E13 = 36. In order to describe the generation of the edges of G according to the groups the nodes belong to, a K \u00d7 K block matrix, denoted by C, is introduced. If G is undirected, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 K ,Cij \u2208[ 0, 1] and represents the probability of occurrence of an edge between a node in group i and a node in group j. Here C is symmetric, as is (1) in the example. If G is directed, for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 K , Cij represents the probability of occurrence of a directed edge from a node in group i to a node in group j, and C needs not be symmetric. Note that no rows or columns in C need to sum to 1. Whether G is undirected or directed, the idea of the block matrix C means that the dyads are conditionally independent given the group memberships Z. In other words, Ypq follows the Bernoulli distribution with success probability ZTpCZq, and is independent of Yrs for (p, q) $= (r, s), givenZp andZq. This implies that the total number of edges between any two blocks i and j is a Binomial distributed random variable with mean equal to the product of Cij and the number of dyads available. For undirected and directed graphs, the latter term is NiNj/2 and NiNj, respectively. In fact, Fig. 2 can be viewed as a realisation of simulating from the Binomial distribution with the respective means. Conversely, the densities of each pair of blocks in the adjacency matrix, calculated to be   0.817 0.049 0.041 0.049 0.784 0.05 0.041 0.05 0.808   , are, as expected, close to (1).

(1) Given the group memberships, the block matrix, and the assumptions of an SBM (to be detailed in \u201cStochastic block models\u201d section), it is straightforward to generate a synthetic network for simulation purposes, as has been done in the example. It will also be straightforward to evaluate the likelihood of data observed, for modelling purposes. However, in applications to real data, neither the groupmemberships nor the block matrix is observed or given. Therefore, the goal of fitting an SBM to a graph is to infer these two components simultaneously. Subsequently, the usual statistical challenges arise: 1. Modelling: How should the SBM be structured or extended to realistically describe real-world networks, with or without additional information on the nodes or the edges? 2. Inference: Once the likelihood can be computed, how should we infer the group memberships and the block matrix? Are there efficient and scalable inference algorithms? 3. Selection and diagnostics: Can we compute measures, such as Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and marginal likelihood, to quantify and compare the goodness of fit of different SBMs? 13 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations Bryan Perozzi Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Rami Al-Rfou Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Steven Skiena Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science {bperozzi, ralrfou, skiena}@cs.stonybrook.edu ABSTRACT We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treat- ing walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk\u2019s latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as Blog- Catalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that Deep- Walk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk\u2019s representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk\u2019s representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.

(a) Input: Karate Graph (b) Output: Representation Figure 1: Our proposed method learns a latent space representation of social interactions in Rd. The learned rep- resentation encodes community structure so it can be eas- ily exploited by standard classification methods. Here, our method is used on Zachary\u2019s Karate network [44] to gen- erate a latent representation in R2. Note the correspon- dence between community structure in the input graph and the embedding. Vertex colors represent a modularity-based clustering of the input graph. ommendation [11], anomaly detection [5], and missing link prediction [22]) must be able to deal with this sparsity in order to survive. In this paper we introduce deep learning (unsupervised feature learning) [2] techniques, which have proven successful in natural language processing, into network analysis for the first time. We develop an algorithm (DeepWalk) that learns social representations of a graph\u2019s vertices, by modeling a stream of short random walks. Social representations are latent features of the vertices that capture neighborhood similarity and community membership. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space with a relatively small number of dimensions. DeepWalk generalizes neural language models to process a special language composed of a set of randomly-generated walks. These neural language models have been used to capture the semantic and syntactic structure of human language [6], and even logical analogies [28]. DeepWalk takes a graph as input and produces a latent representation as an output. The result of applying our method to the well-studied Karate network is shown in Figure 1. The graph, as typically presented by force-directed layouts, is shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the output of our method with 2 latent dimensions. Beyond the striking similarity, we note that linearly separable portions of (1b) correspond to clusters found through modularity maximization in the input graph (1a) (shown as vertex colors).

In many cases they have a precise direction, that needs to be taken into account to understand the system as a whole. As an example we can cite predator-prey relationships in food webs. In Fig. 4 we see another example, taken from technology. The system is the World Wide Web, which can be seen as a graph by representing web pages as vertices and the hyperlinks that make users move from one page to another as edges (Albert et al., 1999). Hyperlinks are directed: if one can move from page A to page B by clicking on a hyperlink of A, one usually does not find on B a hyper- link taking back to A. In fact, very few hyperlinks (less than 10%) are reciprocal. Communities of the web graph are groups of pages having topical similarities. Detect- ing communities in the web graph may help to identify the artificial clusters created by link farms in order to enhance the PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) value of web sites and grant them a higher Google ranking. In this way one could discourage this unfair practice. One usually assumes that the existence of a hyperlink between two pages implies that they are content-related, and that this similarity is independent of the hyperlink direction.

C.1 EXPERIMENT SETTINGS OF MODELS USED IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS Here, we specify the detailed settings in the experiments of real-world problems. Stochastic block model (SBM) network. The structure of SBM network is shown in Figure 7. As me tion d in the main text, all settings remained the same as in previous imbalanced CGCP experiments (see Section 6.2). Community detection benchmarks. In the two problems of the community detection benchmarks, MRIL was not used, since we focus on the i vestigation of how the given algorithms learn the topological and hierarchical structures underlying in input sequences, as well as how well the structures are produced using such algorithms. MRIL cannnot encode input sequences into a map space, therefore it was not considered as a baseline. Regarding the Modularity Max, we again us d TP matrices that produced by the gr phs generated from the given input sequences, as our focus is on the ability of extracting information in input sequences. When finding the communities, we specify the \u201cnumber of communities\u201d to the algorithm. This can be found in the official documentatio of NetworkX (a Python library for analyzing graphs), where we set \u201ca minimum number of communities below which the merging process stops. The process stops at this number of communities even if modularity is not maximized.\u201d However, it should be noted that the process will stop before the cutoff if it finds a maximum of modularity. Based on the given ground-truth, in the Lusseau\u2019s network of bottlenose dolphins, we set the \u201cnumber of communities\u201d at 2. In the Zachary\u2019s karate club network, we set the \u201cnumber of communities\u201d at 2 and 4 for computing NMI with two sets of ground-truth, respectively. Regarding the Word2vec, we set the latent dimension equal to 2, and kept all other parameter settings unchanged. This is to produce a 2-D representation of the given community structures. Also, in the previous experime ts, DBSCAN was used to obtain chunks, where in the real-world problems we replaced it to hierarchical clustering as we are more interested in the topology as well as the hierarchical structures. The original SyncMap and Symmetrical SyncMap shared the same changes with Word2vec, that is, we only reduced the SyncMap space dimension k from 3 to 2. Also, hierarchical clustering is used. 14 Regarding the hierarchical clustering, we used \u201cward\u201d as a linkage method. And we specified the number of clusters when performing the algorithm. In details, for the Lusseau\u2019s network of bottlenose dolphins, we set the \u201cnumber of clusters\u201d at 2. In the Zachary\u2019s karate club network, we set the \u201cnumber of clusters\u201d at 2 and 4 for computing NMI with two sets of ground-truth, respectively. C.2 RESULTS ANALYSIS SBM network. Modularity Max performs nearly optimal in this scenario. Also, recall that it yields relatively low NMI in fixed CGCP. The differences of the performance observed here might be because the communities with many deterministic connections are less likely to appear in usual problems faced by Modularity Max, thus leading to a problem bias; that is, fixed chunk structures are not strictly meet the condition that the possibility of transition to an internal state within a chunk is higher than that of transition to an external state belonging to other chunks. This leads to a problem bias for Modularity Max. Dolphins Network Dendrograms Karate Network Community detection benchmarks. Word2vec, as shown in Figure 9, always forms a latent representation with two long tails. This shape does harm when finding hierarchical structures. We have analyzed the two models of SyncMap in the main text. It is worth noting here that from the dendrograms of the original SyncMap, we can conclude that the original work is not possible to extract local relationships (i.e., hierarchies), as the nodes are all densely distributed in compact communities. Regarding the Modularity Max, it does not encode temporal sequences into a map space, and thus it is not figuratively visualized. Meanwhile, although the datasets here are designed for modularity-based models, Modularity Max failed to extract information and maximize the modularity from sequential data, thus showing lower NMI. D MAPS LEARNED BY DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS:  E STABILITY ANALYSIS: The proposed Symmetrical SyncMap shows good stability over the long run in all imbalanced chunking problems. Figures 11 and 12 show the NMI average with error bar (s.t.d.) at every 10,000 time step during training in all imbalanced problems. F PARAMETER SENSITIVITY ANAYLSIS: Table 2 shows the performance of Symmetrical SyncMap on the same imbalanced experiments (fixed/probabilistic/mixed 20-10-5 test) but with different parameters settings. Results suggest that Symmetrical SyncMap is robust to changes in parameters, with mostly smooth changes. Note that the parameter Pr is designed for solving small chunks. To illustrate, if Pr = 100%, then at every time step we apply state memory generalization to have a longer memory window. In this case, if the current chunk is too small (e.g., only having 3 states), then it would probably not be detected. Therefore, choosing Pr = 30% provides a trade-off between finding big and small chunks. In fact, in the future version of our model, this parameter will no longer be used, as tiny chunk/communities are rarely appear alone, while they usually appear inside a big chunk (i.e., hierarchies). Having said that, the results of using Pr = 100% and Pr = 30% are both adequate. G ALGORITHMIC DESCRIPTION OF SYMMETRICAL SYNCMAP:  H STATISTICAL TESTS: We used a t-test with p-value of 0.05 to verify if the best result is statistically significantly different from other results. h is the hypothesis test result (h=0 indicates a failure to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, and h=1 otherwise). p is the two-tailed p value, and ci is the confidence interval for the difference in population means of two samples. I RELATED WORKS: Chunking is an extremely multidisciplinary problem. In the main text, we attempt to cover a number of related topics from neuroscience to machine learning and try to connect them to this work. Due to the page limit, we review additional related works here for completeness. Latent Variable Estimation. Some literature focusing on latent variable estimation solve problems which are related to chunking (Fox et al., 2011; Qian & Aslin, 2014; Pfau et al., 2010). However, they have different objectives, since chunking is a self-organizing process over the variables of the problem with respect to their temporal correlation. Even if chunks of variables can be abstracted as a set of variables, there is still an inherent difference between chunks and latent variables. Unsupervised Learning for Sequences. Feature extraction is commonly used to predict future input in unsupervised learning for sequences (Clark et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2017; Mikolov et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2018). A peculiar learning algorithm called contrastive predictive encoding (CPE) has been proposed, which represents sequences by using a probabilistic contrastive loss in the latent space to encode maximally useful information (Hjelm et al., 2018). CPE solves problems which are complementary rather than competing with the problem presented here.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: Symmetrical SyncMap for Imbalanced General Chunking Problems\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Human brains have been proved to have unsupervised abilities to detect repetitive patterns in sequences involving texts, sounds and images (Orba\u0301n et al., 2008; Bulf et al., 2011; Strauss et al., 2015). In the field of neuroscience, part of this behavior is known as chunking. Chunking has been verified in many experiments to play an important role in a diverse range of cognitive functions (Schapiro et al., 2013; Yokoi & Diedrichsen, 2019; Asabuki & Fukai, 2020). Related to chunking problems, many sequence processing algorithms in machine learning have been proposed for time-series clustering (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015) based on similarity measurements (Figure 1(a)). Chunking sequences between state variables, however, is still underexplored (see Figure 1(b)(c)). Recently, Vargas & Asabuki (2021) proposed the first learning of chunking based solely on selforganization called SyncMap. The authors also extended chunking problems into one called Continual General Chunking Problem (CGCP), which includes problems with diverse structures that can change dynamically throughout the experiments. For the first time, SyncMap was shown not only able to uncover complex structures from sequential data, but also to adapt to continuously changing structures. It achieves this with self-organizing dynamics that maps temporal input correlations to spacial correlations, where the dynamics are always updating with negative/positive feedback loops. In this work, however, we identify problems in the original dynamics that lead to long-term instability, and we further show that performances in imbalanced CGCPs are poor given the asymmetric number of updates, i.e., the number of negative updates is much bigger than that of the positive ones. Beyond identifying these problems, here we propose Symmetrical SyncMap, which can solve both of the problems above using symmetric selection of nodes and generalized memory window. Symmetrical SyncMap solves the instability of the dynamics efficiently, and goes beyond to propose a solution to deal with imbalanced general chunking problems. As opposed to the original SyncMap that suffers from the uneven updates from positive/negative feedback loops, we propose symmetrical activation, and further introduce the concept of memory window, so that the system can have more updates from positive feedback loop while concurrently reducing the number of negative updates. In fact, the symmetrical number of updates not only compensates when imbalanced chunks are presented, but also makes the algorithm stable over the long run and reaches an equilibrium quickly in changing environments. By showing that equilibrium and self-organization can appear only with dynamical equations and without optimization/loss functions, the biggest motivation from this paper is realizing how the substantial improvements, beyond the self-organization inspiration, make the new learning paradigm very adaptive and precise. Moreover, the simplicity of the modifications here, as supported by the effectiveness in real-world scenarios of structure learning, solves the problem at the foundation, while keeping the final method concise and improving it in both accuracy and stability. 2 RELATED WORKS: Chunking. Natural neural systems are well known for the unsupervised adaptivity, since they can self-organize by many mechanisms for several purposes on many timescales (Lukos\u030cevicius, 2012). One of the mechanisms is chunking, which can be described as a biological process where the brain attains compact representation of sequences (Estes et al., 2007; Ramkumar et al., 2016). Specifically, long and complex sequences are first segmented into short and simple ones, while frequently repeated segments are concatenated into single units (Asabuki & Fukai, 2020). This can be seen as a complexity reduction for temporal information processing and associated cost (Ramkumar et al., 2016). Albeit our focus is more on neuroscience and machine learning perspectives, earlier algorithms proposed for solving chunking problems are from linguistics and include PARSER (Perruchet & Vinter, 1998). It performs well in detecting simple chunks, but fails when the probability of state transition are uniform (Schapiro et al., 2013). A neuro-inspired sequence learning model, Minimization of Regularized Information Loss (MRIL) was proposed by applying a family of competitive network of two compartment neuron models that aims to predict its own output in a type of self-supervised neuron (Asabuki & Fukai, 2020). Albeit the interesting paradigm, MRIL has been shown unstable even for problems in which it performs reasonably well. Very recently, a self-organizing learning paradigm (called SyncMap) has been proposed, which surpassed MRIL in all scenarios (Vargas & Asabuki, 2021). Time-series Clustering. Time series data is defined as a sequence of continuous, real-valued elements, usually with high dimensionality and large data size (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015). As a subroutine in unsupervised sequence processing, time-series clustering aims to uncover patterns, usually in very large sequential datasets that cannot be manually handled. This can be found in some articles applying competition-based self-organizing maps (SOMs) (Kohonen, 1990) and their variations (Vannucci & Colla, 2018; Fortuin et al., 2018), which are well-suited for clustering time series but not capable of chunking time series. In other words, these SOMs were not designed to find the underlying structures of sequences and correlation between variables, therefore, their objectives are different. A comparison of time-series clustering and sequence chunking is shown in Figure 1. Word Embeddings. In the field of natural language processing, word embedding algorithms generally transforms texts and paragraphs into vector representations (Khattak et al., 2019; Bojanowski et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018). FastText enriched the word vector with subword information (Bojanowski et al., 2017), whereas ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) aimed to represent word by contextualized word embeddings. Chunking problems presented here are related to some of them, such as a prediction-based Word2vec embedding algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013) that transforms texts into a vector space representation and can be combined with clustering to deal with chunking problems. Therefore, Word2vec is used in the experiments. Representation Learning and Communities Detection. The problem of finding probabilistic chunks refers to a random walk over a graph with several chunk structures; in which the possibility of transition to an internal state within a chunk is higher than that of transition to an external state belonging to other chunks. Such graph structures mentioned above can be seen as communities (Radicchi et al., 2004), which are most-studied by recent representation learning algorithms such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2016). More related, the Modularity Maximization (Newman & Girvan, 2004; Tang & Liu, 2009) uses eigen-decomposition performed on the modularity matrix to learn vertex representation of community. By using the adjacency matrix (transition probability matrix) to convert sequential data to graph structure, Modularity Maximization can also deal with chunking problems via random walk over the generated graphs. Although there exists newer modularity-based algorithms which try to optimize the pioneering work, such as Louvain method (Blondel et al., 2008), their objective is mostly to reduce the computational cost. Therefore, we use the original Modularity Maximization in the comparison. 3 CONTINUAL GENERAL CHUNKING PROBLEMS: Recently, a problem called Continual General Chunking Problem (CGCP) has been first proposed by Vargas & Asabuki (2021). The paper generalized various problems from neuroscience to computer science, including chunking, causal and temporal communities and unsupervised feature learning of time sequences. Such problems are considered as extracting co-occurring states from time sequences, in which the generation process (i.e., data structure) can change over time. To illustrate, the input sequences of CGCP contain state variables where each state belongs to a fixed chunk or a probabilistic chunk, transitioning by first-order Markov chain. The element of the transition matrix is given by: Pab = Pr[st+1 = b|st = a], where st is the state vector at t; and a and b are the label of states. Specifically, the fixed chunk problem (see Figure 1(d) the blue chunk) refers to the situation that the next state st+1, with respect to the current state st, is deterministic within a chunk. For example, if a and b are two continuous elements of a fixed chunk with direction a to b, then Pab = 1, \u2211 b Pab = 1. More realistically, the probabilistic chunk problem (see Figure 1(d) the orange chunk) refers to input sequences which are generated by giving a random walk over graphs. The graphs are characterized by two types of degrees: internal degree kinti and external degrees k ext i of state i. For every state, the following constrain holds: kinti > k ext i for all i \u2208 A, where A is the set of all states in sequences. The above constraint is satisfied if the graph has dense connections within chunks but sparse connections between nodes in different chunks. Beyond generalizing chunking problems to fixed and probabilistic chunks, CGCP also considers their continual variations. This is motivated by the constant adaptation observed by neural cells that can relatively switch behavior quickly in different environments (Dahmen et al., 2010). In this case, the data structure can change over time, conferring a harder albeit realistic setting. 4 SYNCMAP: SyncMap is a sole self-organization based algorithm proposed by Vargas & Asabuki (2021). It solves CGCP by creating a projected map that encodes the temporal correlation (chunks) as spatial distance between nodes. In SyncMap\u2019s dynamic, nodes which are activated together tend to be grouped as chunks, while nodes that do not activate together will be pulled away from each other. The algorithm is explained in detail in the following, with a brief example shown in Figure 2(a). Input Encoding. Consider an input sequence of state variables S = {s1, s2, ..., st, ..., s\u03c4}, where \u03c4 is the sequence length. st = {s1,t, ..., sn,t}T is a vector at time step t, and its elements si,t, i = 1, ..., n hold constrain si,t \u2208 {0, 1} : \u2211n i=1 si,t = 1, where n is the number of states. The input is encoded as an exponentially decaying vector xt = {x1,t, ..., xn,t}T having the same shape as st: xi,t = { si,ta \u2217 e\u22120.1\u2217(t\u2212ta), t\u2212 ta < m \u2217 tstep 0, otherwise (1) where ta is the last state transition to state si, and m is the state memory. Specifically, state transitions happen every tstep step (also known as time delay), and variables that have their activation period greater than m \u2217 tstep are set to 0. m and tstep are set at 2 and 10 in the original work. An example of the encoded exponentially decaying input is shown in Figure 2(a). Training Dynamic. We generate weight nodes wi,t in SyncMap\u2019s map space to obtain pair tuple (xi,t, wi,t). Nodes are first randomly initialized in a k dimensional map space. Note that weight node wi,t \u2208 Rk is a point in SyncMap\u2019s map space, and it can also be considered as a vector). In every iteration when a new input vector xt comes in, all its elements xi,t, together with the corresponding nodes wi,t, are divided into two sets according to the threshold value a: (1) activated or recently activated (positive) set PSt = {i|xi,t > a} and (2) non-recently activated (negative) set NSt = {i|xi,t \u2264 a}. The original SyncMap used a directly at 0.1. In this paper we introduce threshold value a which allows us to achieve more general state memory implementation. Inside the space, the centroids of PSt and NSt sets are calculated as follows if and only if the cardinality of both sets are greater than one in this iteration (i.e., |PSt| > 1 and |NSt| > 1): cpt= \u2211 i\u2208PSt wi,t |PSt| , cnt= \u2211 i\u2208NSt wi,t |NSt| (2) where cpt and cnt are the centroids of PSt and NSt respectively. Finally, node wi,t corresponding to each input xi,t is updated: \u03d5i,t = { 1, i \u2208 PSt 0, i \u2208 NSt , \u03b1 = { \u03b1, i \u2208 PSt \u222aNSt 0, otherwise (3) wi,t+1=wi,t+\u03b1( \u03d5i,t(cpt\u2212wi,t) ||wi,t\u2212cpt|| \u2212 (1\u2212\u03d5i,t)(cnt\u2212wi,t) ||wi,t\u2212cnt|| ) (4) where \u03b1 is the learning rate and ||\u00b7|| is the Euclidean distance. Subsequently, updated nodes are normalized to be within a hyper-sphere having radius of 10 at the end of the iteration. Clustering Phase. SyncMap forms a map during dynamic training, which has the number of nodes equal to the number of input states n. After training, DBSCAN is used (Schubert et al., 2017) for clustering with the pre-defined density parameters eps and minimum cluster mc, as it does not require the number of clusters as input. Limitations of SyncMap. Although SyncMap shows capabilities to address all kinds of CGCP, one crucial issue is the instability of its dynamic in the long term. This is due to the asymmetric number of updates with respect to positive and negative nodes. Figure 2(b) shows how this happens with an example of nine nodes in 2-D SyncMap. The fixed state memory (m = 2) results in an uneven update of positive (7) and negative (2) nodes, i.e., the dynamic\u2019s update is more influenced by negative feedback loop, which causes an undesirable convergence in the long run. 5 SYMMETRICAL SYNCMAP: Inspired by how neural efficiency influences brain activation by focusing the energy on smaller brain areas (Neubauer & Fink, 2009); here we propose an algorithm called Symmetrical SyncMap to better solve CGCP, particularly the imbalanced chunking problems. The main idea is to use symmetrical positive and negative activations. In other words, we try to reduce the number of activated negative nodes while selecting and activating more positive nodes in every iteration, thus balancing the updating rates in negative and positive feedback loops. To achieve symmetrical activation, we introduce stochastic selection and memory window. 5.1 MEMORY WINDOW: GENERALIZING THE STATE MEMORY: We introduce memory window to our algorithm by generalizing the state memory m, which allows a wider window for updates from the positive feedback loop, thus helping to capture the bigger chunks. This is achieved by tuning the threshold value a as mentioned in SyncMap\u2019s definition, i.e., any nodes wi,t having its corresponding input value xi,t greater than a will be divided into PSt set and vice versa (a true or false logical operation). With a pre-defined tstep, one can easily adjust threshold a to control the state memory m (tstep=10, a=0.05 and m=3 in Figure 3(a)). 5.2 SYMMETRICAL ACTIVATION: Symmetrical activation is the core of our proposed algorithm, where equal number of positive and negative nodes are selected to activate at each time step. We propose stochastic selection to select nodes without bias in PSt and NSt sets. Details are shown in Figure 3. Stochastically select nodes into PSt set. With a pre-defined state memory m, we first obtain the temporary PStemp set in a same way the original SyncMap obtains PSt (i.e., PStemp includes m positive nodes, and PStemp \u2286 Wt, where Wt = {wi,t|i = 1, ..., n} is the set including all nodes). Then, we apply stochastic selection to select positive nodes into PSt (i.e., a sampling process). Whether to enable stochastic selection at this particular time step is determined by a probability parameter Pr \u2208 [0, 1]. In other word, if stochastic selection were enabled, we randomly select 2 positive nodes and \u201cinhibit\u201d (ignore) other m\u2212 2 nodes in PStemp, with the probability of Pr when state memory m > 2; otherwise we select all m nodes. When m = 2, stochastic selection is not used and two most-recent states are selected. Afterwards, PSt is updated, which only includes those activated positive nodes (PSt \u2286 PStemp). Additionally, we give an analysis of Pr in Appendix F. Stochastically select nodes into NSt set. After obtaining the above PSt, we define the temporary negative set NStemp=Wt-PSt. One may notice that there is a chance that some nodes in PStemp could potentially be sampled as nodes in NStemp. This is desirable as it introduces a more uniform selection process and produces more robust results. Next, we again use the stochastic selection for sampling several negative nodes in NStemp set. The number of negative nodes being selected is symmetrically equal to the cardinality of PSt (i.e., |NSt| = |PSt|). After this step, the NSt set is updated (NSt \u2286 NStemp, see the right part of Figure 3(d) for example). The remaining steps of dynamic training follows the Equations 2 to 4. Here, we calculate a moving average of 10000 steps of nodes in the map and use the average for clustering, instead of applying DBSCAN to the map at a particular time step in the original work. An algorithmic description of the proposed algorithm is shown in Appendix G. 6 EXPERIMENTS OF CGCP PROBLEMS: We evaluate the proposed Symmetrical SyncMap with 13 tests, including (i) a long-term behavior analysis, and (ii) 12 imbalanced CGCP with fixed, probabilistic and mixed chunks, as well as their continual variations. Among the large number of clustering quality measurements, we used Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) (Studholme et al., 1999) for measurement (see Appendix A for math detail). NMI ranges between 0 and 1, and the higher the score, the better the chunking performance. We did 30 trials for each experiment. Results of NMI are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1. We used a t-test with p-value of 0.05 to verify if the best result is statistically significantly different from the others (statistical results are in Appendix H). 6.1 LONG TERM BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS EXPERIMENT: To evaluate the behavior of the algorithm over the long run, we set up this experiment. The problem considered here is a continual changing environment with ten fixed chunks, each containing six different states. Transitions between chunks happen at the end of a chunk sequence (i.e., after the sixth state variable presented inside a chunk). A chunk can transit to any other chunk with equal probability. Sequence length was set to \u03c4=600000. At time step t=0 the first environment was initialized. After t=300000 the problem changed to the second environment by re-assigning all 60 states into new ten chunks. We applied the original SyncMap and the proposed one in this experiment. We used the same parameter settings of the two models, where \u03b1=0.001*n, k=2, eps=1 and mc=2. Besides, m=3 and Pr=30% were used for Symmetrical SyncMap training. Results in Figure 4 show that Symmetrical SyncMap reaches near the optimal performance in this experiment. By applying symmetrical activation, Symmetrical SyncMap can have long-term stability while keeping NMI near 1.0. In contrast, the NMI of the original SyncMap reaches the peak near 0.88 at t=70000 and decreases constantly afterwards. After environment changes, Symmetrical SyncMap detects new chunks and reaches to a new equilibrium quickly, while the original SyncMap performs poorer and becomes unstable in the long run. 6.2 IMBALANCED CGCP PROBLEMS: Baselines and Parameter Settings. We test several imbalanced CGCP problems and their continual variations by using Symmetrical SyncMap, SyncMap, Modularity Maximization (Modularity Max), Word2vec and MRIL. In detail, Symmetrical SyncMap\u2019s parameters were set to \u03b1=0.001*n, k=3, m=3, Pr=30%, eps=4.5 and mc=2. We conducted a parameter sensitivity analysis shown in Appendix F. For the original SyncMap, we used k=3, m=2, eps=4.5 and mc=2. Regarding the Modularity Max, we first converted the input sequence to transition probability (TP) matrix, and then used the TP matrix to generate a graph for communities detection. To evaluate how a word embedding algorithm would fair in CGCP, a skip-gram Word2vec algorithm was modified to suit in the context of CGCP. Here, a latent dimension of 3 and an output layer with softmax were used, and the output size is equal to the inputs. Learning rate was set at 0.001 and batch size was 64 with a mean squared error as loss. A window of 100 steps (equivalent to 10 state transitions) was used to compute the output probability of skip-gram. Regarding the MRIL, we used 5 output neurons for all experiments, with the learning rate of 0.001. We gathered the output neurons showing correlation larger than 0.5, detecting chunks by assigning an index of groups that maximally respond to each input. The input sequences of all baselines were the same exponential decaying input as used in Symmetrical SyncMap. Problem Settings (Appendix B). We first consider several environments which consist of 3 different sizes of chunks: big, moderate and small chunks. Specifically, the big chunk has 20 state variables, while the moderate and small chunks have 10 and 5 respectively. Based on the chunk settings, we then designed three types of imbalanced problems: (i) Two big and one small chunks (20-20-5). (ii) One big, one moderate and one small chunks (20-10-5). (iii) One big and two small chunks (20-5-5). We tested these three types of imbalanced problems with three different structure settings: fixed, probabilistic and mixed chunks tests. The structures of the fixed and probabilistic environments are shown in Figure 1(d). Please refer to Figure 6 in Appendix B for the examples of the complete structures. Regarding the mixed tests, two probabilistic chunks and one fixed chunk were presented in each environment, where the order of chunks in the input sequence was specified as: 1st probabilistic to fixed to 2nd probabilistic chunk. Sequence length \u03c4 is set at 200000 for all types of test. Dynamical Continual Variation. Three dynamical variations of the above-mentioned problems were presented: continual fixed, continual probabilistic and continual mixed. Sequence length was set to 2\u03c4 . States were permuted between chunks: at time step t=0 the first type of problem was 15-15-5 (see the problem formalism in previous subsection), after t=\u03c4 the second type of problem was 20-10-5. Results Overview. The proposed algorithm Symmetrical SyncMap learns nearly the optimal solutions in all imbalanced CGCPs. It surpasses or ties other algorithms in all tests (Tables 1). Modularity Max performs the second best, in which it wins or ties the others in 2 out of 3 probabilistic CGCP tests. Word2vec achieves relatively higher NMI in probabilistic CGCPs than other problem structures, whereas MRIL performs the worst overall in all tests. The original SyncMap performs good in 20-20-5 CGCPs, yet performance decrease is witnessed as more chunks become smaller. Symmetrical SyncMap, with its inherent adaptivity, performs significantly better than all other competitive algorithms, particularly in continual variations (i.e., dynamical CGCPs where environment can change). The proposed wider memory window and symmetrical activation allow capturing states in big chunks compactly, while at the same time the stochastic selection with suitable Pr helps to separate small chunks (See the learned maps and Pr analysis in Appendices D and F), thus keeping the balance between dealing with small and big chunks. In all probabilistic CGCP tests, it produces very distinct chunks and learns the best solution (i.e., NMI=1.0). The performance downgrades slightly during the more challenging mixed CGCP tests, due to an extra imbalanced frequency issue: the fixed chunk inserted between two probabilistic chunks has lower frequency to appear in the sequences. Having said that, the proposed algorithm still outperforms the others in all mixed CGCPs with a very big lead. Original SyncMap performs relatively better in 20-20-5 type CGCPs, with the steady decrease in 20-10-5 and 20-5-5 ones. In fixed CGCPs, it makes distinct clusters for smaller chunks, yet fails to group nodes of the big chunk together. In probabilistic and mixed tests, nodes belong to smaller chunks are merged into one cluster in almost every individual trial (see Figures in Appendix D). Modularity Max shares the highest NMI score with Symmetrical SyncMap in two probabilistic CGCP tests. However, this graph-based algorithm does not perform well in other imbalanced CGCPs. A possible reason is that fixed chunks are less likely to appear in usual problems faced by Modularity Max, thus leading to a problem bias. It is worth noting that comparing the results of Modularity Max to the other algorithms in dynamical CGCPs is not fair, since a TP matrix would record all the occurrence of state variables; thus, passing a continual changing TP matrix is not inherently suitable for Modularity Max, leading to worse results in continual structures than that in static graphs. Word2vec creates maps in which nodes are more dispersed than that produced by SyncMap, thus making clustering difficult. It performs better in probabilistic chunk tests than fixed and mixed ones (see Figures in Appendix D). For the continual problems, Word2vec lacks the ability of adaptation, thus showing the overall lower NMI scores. MRIL fails to detect imbalanced chunks with large number of state variables, and therefore it performs the worst in all tests. Increasing the number of output neurons may improve the performance of fixed chunk tests. DeepWalk: Onlin L rning of Social Repres n ations Bryan Perozzi Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Rami Al-Rfou Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Steven Skiena Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science {bperozzi, ralrfou, skiena}@cs.stonybrook.edu ABSTRACT We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treat- ing walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk\u2019s latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as Blog- Catalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that Deep- Walk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk\u2019s representations can pro- vide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, Deep- Walk\u2019s representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.

The learned representation encodes community structure so it can be easily exploited by standard classification methods. Here, our method is used on Zachary\u2019s Karate network [44] to generate a latent representation in R2. Note the correspondence between community structure in the input graph and the embedding. Vertex colors represent a modularity-based clustering of the input graph. ommendation [11], anomaly detection [5], and missing link prediction [22]) must be able to deal with this sparsity in order to survive. In this paper we introduce deep learning (unsupervised feature learning) [2] techniques, which have proven successful in natural language processing, into network analysis for the first time. We develop an algorithm (DeepWalk) that learns social representations of a graph\u2019s vertices, by modeling a stream of short random walks. Social representations are latent features of the vertices that capture neighborhood similarity and community membership. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space with a relatively small number of dimensions. DeepWalk generalizes neural language models to process a special language composed of a set of randomly-generated walks. These neural language models have been used to capture the semantic and syntactic structure of human language [6], and even logical analogies [28]. DeepWalk takes a graph as input and produces a latent representation as an output. The result of applying our method to the well-studied Karate network is shown in Figure 1. The graph, as typically presented by force-directed layouts, is shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the output of our method with 2 latent dimensions. Beyond the striking similarity, we note that linearly separable portions of (1b) correspond to clusters found through modularity maximization in the input graph (1a) (shown as vertex colors).

In many cases they have a precise direction, that needs to be taken into account to understand the system as a whole. As an example we can cite predator-prey relationships in food webs. In Fig. 4 we see another example, taken from technology. The system is the World Wide Web, which can be seen as a graph by representing web pages as vertices and the hyperlinks that make users move from one page to another as edges (Albert et al., 1999). Hyperlinks are directed: if one can move from page A to page B by clicking on a hyperlink of A, one usually does not find on B a hyper- link taking back to A. In fact, very few hyperlinks (less than 10%) are reciprocal. Communities of the web graph are groups of pages having topical similarities. Detect- ing communities in the web graph may help to identify the artificial clusters created by link farms in order to enhance the PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) value of web sites and grant them a higher Google ranking. In this way one could discourage this unfair practice. One usually assumes that the existence of a hyperlink between two pages implies that they are content-related, and that this similarity is independent of the hyperlink direction.

See Appendix C for more analysis. 8 7 REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS: We study three real-world scenarios to verify the performance of Symmetrical SyncMap: (i) a network of stochastic block model (SBM); and (ii) two social network datasets with well-established community structures. For the SBM, we test a reference network introduced by Lee & Wilkinson (2019), where the network is considered as a graph which was then converted to a high-dimensional CGCP (i.e., 3 sightly imbalanced communities with a total of 90 nodes and 1192 edges). The groundtruth is defined in Appendix C. Parameter settings of all models remained the same as in previous imbalanced CGCP experiments. As shown in Table 1, both original and Symmetrical SyncMap yield the optimal solution, showing the capabilities to tackle with large-scale CGCP. We then test two well-studied benchmark networks in community detection. Hierarchical clustering was applied to replace DBSCAN in the clustering phase, to produce dendrograms for the visualization of hierarchies (i.e., by specifying the number of communities/chunks). Detailed settings and analysis for baselines are in Appendix C. NMI results are shown in Figure 5(c) with statistics. The first one is the Lusseau\u2019s network of bottlenose dolphins (Fortunato, 2010), an imbalanced structure with 2 ground-truth communities of sizes 20 and 42. Our algorithm yields a much higher NMI than other algorithms. It avoids forming dense communities produced by the original SyncMap (see Figure 5(b)(f)), allowing local relationships to be extracted, as verified in the following problem. The second problem is the Zachary\u2019s karate club network which contains 34 nodes and 78 undirected and unweighted edges. We used two sets of ground-truth: (i) 2 chunks labeled by the original paper (Zachary, 1977), and (ii) 4 chunks found through modularity-based clustering (Perozzi et al., 2014). Symmetrical SyncMap depicts the global graph structure while preserving the topology of local communities (Figure 5(e)(h)(i)). In contrast, the original SyncMap can only separate two global communities with a very dense representation (Figure 5(d)(e)). This unavoidable convergence is due to the stronger negative feedbacks over time, pulling away nodes from each community/chunk. Note that the representation learned by our method is comparable to node embeddings models with loss functions required and with more expensive training procedures such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) and Graph Convolutional Networks (Kipf & Welling, 2016). Unlike graph-based models, we achieve this by (i) mapping correlations from temporal input to a latent state space, (ii) keeping equilibrium by symmetrical activation (otherwise nodes would be locked in dense communities), and thus (iii) enabling hierarchies to be extracted from sequences. More importantly, the inherent adaptivity, as shown in previous experiments, suggests that our model a has potential usage in inductive applications, as it does not require any additional optimizations when dealing with new nodes/(sub)structures, while transductive methods such as DeepWalk cannot naturally generalize to unseen nodes or changed structures (Hamilton et al., 2017). Having said that, we argue that these real-world scenarios usually (i) have no ground-truth and (ii) are strongly biased towards standard algorithms. To illustrate, the absence of ground-truth has to do with the fact that: it is not only difficult to define the social structures, but also hard to know the existence of real chunks in nature; thus, any answer would be a guess at most. Besides, the bias is due to the output, used as ground-truth, is found by using standard algorithms in the original papers, which makes good results in real-world data more like \u201calgorithms that perform similar to standard algorithms\u201d, rather than \u201calgorithms that work with real-world data\u201d. 8 CONCLUSIONS: We propose Symmetrical SyncMap, a brain inspired self-organizing algorithm built on top of the original work to solve continual general chunking problems (CGCP). Experiments of different CGCPs have illustrated how effective the concise modifications work on those challenging tasks. By applying symmetrical activation to the dynamical equations in which loss/optimization functions are not required, our algorithm not only learns imbalanced CGCP data structures with great long-term stability and adaptivity, but also shows the potentials to uncover complex hierarchical topologies encoded in temporal sequences. This reveals the self-organizing ability of the proposed algorithm in analyzing the community structures of a broad class of temporal inputs. Future goals, advised by the results presented in this paper, will be to investigate CGCP problems with large scale, hierarchies and noisy environments, and tasks specific to representation learning in various real-world scenarios. 9 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT: We took every effort to make this work reproducible.

A DEFINITION OF NORMALIZED MUTUAL INFORMATION (NMI): Among the large number of clustering quality measurements, we used the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for measurement. Mathematically, NMI is defined as: NMI( \u02c6Y, Y ) = I(Y\u0302 ;Y ) 1 2 (H(Y\u0302 ) +H(Y )) , NMI \u2208 [0, 1] (5) where Y\u0302 and Y are the output of algorithms and the truth labels, respectively. I(Y\u0302 ;Y ) is the mutual information and H(\u2217) is the entropy. NMI ranges between 0 and 1, and the higher the score, the better the clustering performance (better correlation between Y\u0302 and Y ). B EXAMPLES OF IMBALANCED CGCPS: C ANALYSIS OF REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS Lee and Wilkinson Applied Network Science (2019) 4:122 Page 5 of 50 The group sizes can be derived from Z, and are denoted by N = (N1 N2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 NK )T . Essentially,Ni is the sum, or number of non-zero elements, of the i-th column of Z. In the example, N1 = 25, N2 = 30, N3 = 35. Finally, the K \u00d7 K edge matrix between groups can be derived from Z and Y. It is denoted by E, where Eij represents the number of edges between groups i and j in undirected graphs, and from group i to group j in directed ones. In the example, E is symmetric as G is undirected, and E11 = 245, E22 = 341, E33 = 481, E12 = E21 = 37, E23 = E32 = 52, and E31 = E13 = 36. In order to describe the generation of the edges of G according to the groups the nodes belong to, a K \u00d7 K block matrix, denoted by C, is introduced. If G is undirected, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 K ,Cij \u2208[ 0, 1] and represents the probability of occurrence of an edge between a node in group i and a node in group j. Here C is symmetric, as is (1) in the example. If G is directed, for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 K , Cij represents the probability of occurrence of a directed edge from a node in group i to a node in group j, and C needs not be symmetric. Note that no rows or columns in C need to sum to 1. Whether G is undirected or directed, the idea of the block matrix C means that the dyads are conditionally independent given the group memberships Z. In other words, Ypq follows the Bernoulli distribution with success probability ZTpCZq, and is independent of Yrs for (p, q) $= (r, s), givenZp andZq. This implies that the total number of edges between any two blocks i and j is a Binomial distributed random variable with mean equal to the product of Cij and the number of dyads available. For undirected and directed graphs, the latter term is NiNj/2 and NiNj, respectively. In fact, Fig. 2 can be viewed as a realisation of simulating from the Binomial distribution with the respective means. Conversely, the densities of each pair of blocks in the adjacency matrix, calculated to be   0.817 0.049 0.041 0.049 0.784 0.05 0.041 0.05 0.808   , are, as expected, close to (1).

(1) Given the group memberships, the block matrix, and the assumptions of an SBM (to be detailed in \u201cStochastic block models\u201d section), it is straightforward to generate a synthetic network for simulation purposes, as has been done in the example. It will also be straightforward to evaluate the likelihood of data observed, for modelling purposes. However, in applications to real data, neither the groupmemberships nor the block matrix is observed or given. Therefore, the goal of fitting an SBM to a graph is to infer these two components simultaneously. Subsequently, the usual statistical challenges arise: 1. Modelling: How should the SBM be structured or extended to realistically describe real-world networks, with or without additional information on the nodes or the edges? 2. Inference: Once the likelihood can be computed, how should we infer the group memberships and the block matrix? Are there efficient and scalable inference algorithms? 3. Selection and diagnostics: Can we compute measures, such as Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and marginal likelihood, to quantify and compare the goodness of fit of different SBMs? 13 Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations Bryan Perozzi Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Rami Al-Rfou Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science Steven Skiena Stony Brook University Department of Computer Science {bperozzi, ralrfou, skiena}@cs.stonybrook.edu ABSTRACT We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treat- ing walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk\u2019s latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as Blog- Catalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that Deep- Walk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk\u2019s representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk\u2019s representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.

INTRODUCTION The sparsity of a network representation is both a strength and a weakness. Sparsity enables the design of e cient discrete algorithms, but can make it harder to generalize in statistical learning.

(a) Input: Karate Graph (b) Output: Representation Figure 1: Our proposed method learns a latent space representation of social interactions in Rd. The learned rep- resentation encodes community structure so it can be eas- ily exploited by standard classification methods. Here, our method is used on Zachary\u2019s Karate network [44] to gen- erate a latent representation in R2. Note the correspon- dence between community structure in the input graph and the embedding. Vertex colors represent a modularity-based clustering of the input graph. ommendation [11], anomaly detection [5], and missing link prediction [22]) must be able to deal with this sparsity in order to survive. In this paper we introduce deep learning (unsupervised feature learning) [2] techniques, which have proven successful in natural language processing, into network analysis for the first time. We develop an algorithm (DeepWalk) that learns social representations of a graph\u2019s vertices, by modeling a stream of short random walks. Social representations are latent features of the vertices that capture neighborhood similarity and community membership. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space with a relatively small number of dimensions. DeepWalk generalizes neural language models to process a special language composed of a set of randomly-generated walks. These neural language models have been used to capture the semantic and syntactic structure of human language [6], and even logical analogies [28]. DeepWalk takes a graph as input and produces a latent representation as an output. The result of applying our method to the well-studied Karate network is shown in Figure 1. The graph, as typically presented by force-directed layouts, is shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the output of our method with 2 latent dimensions. Beyond the striking similarity, we note that linearly separable portions of (1b) correspond to clusters found through modularity maximization in the input graph (1a) (shown as vertex colors).

In many cases they have a precise direction, that needs to be taken into account to understand the system as a whole. As an example we can cite predator-prey relationships in food webs. In Fig. 4 we see another example, taken from technology. The system is the World Wide Web, which can be seen as a graph by representing web pages as vertices and the hyperlinks that make users move from one page to another as edges (Albert et al., 1999). Hyperlinks are directed: if one can move from page A to page B by clicking on a hyperlink of A, one usually does not find on B a hyper- link taking back to A. In fact, very few hyperlinks (less than 10%) are reciprocal. Communities of the web graph are groups of pages having topical similarities. Detect- ing communities in the web graph may help to identify the artificial clusters created by link farms in order to enhance the PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) value of web sites and grant them a higher Google ranking. In this way one could discourage this unfair practice. One usually assumes that the existence of a hyperlink between two pages implies that they are content-related, and that this similarity is independent of the hyperlink direction.

C.1 EXPERIMENT SETTINGS OF MODELS USED IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS Here, we specify the detailed settings in the experiments of real-world problems. Stochastic block model (SBM) network. The structure of SBM network is shown in Figure 7. As me tion d in the main text, all settings remained the same as in previous imbalanced CGCP experiments (see Section 6.2). Community detection benchmarks. In the two problems of the community detection benchmarks, MRIL was not used, since we focus on the i vestigation of how the given algorithms learn the topological and hierarchical structures underlying in input sequences, as well as how well the structures are produced using such algorithms. MRIL cannnot encode input sequences into a map space, therefore it was not considered as a baseline. Regarding the Modularity Max, we again us d TP matrices that produced by the gr phs generated from the given input sequences, as our focus is on the ability of extracting information in input sequences. When finding the communities, we specify the \u201cnumber of communities\u201d to the algorithm. This can be found in the official documentatio of NetworkX (a Python library for analyzing graphs), where we set \u201ca minimum number of communities below which the merging process stops. The process stops at this number of communities even if modularity is not maximized.\u201d However, it should be noted that the process will stop before the cutoff if it finds a maximum of modularity. Based on the given ground-truth, in the Lusseau\u2019s network of bottlenose dolphins, we set the \u201cnumber of communities\u201d at 2. In the Zachary\u2019s karate club network, we set the \u201cnumber of communities\u201d at 2 and 4 for computing NMI with two sets of ground-truth, respectively. Regarding the Word2vec, we set the latent dimension equal to 2, and kept all other parameter settings unchanged. This is to produce a 2-D representation of the given community structures. Also, in the previous experime ts, DBSCAN was used to obtain chunks, where in the real-world problems we replaced it to hierarchical clustering as we are more interested in the topology as well as the hierarchical structures. The original SyncMap and Symmetrical SyncMap shared the same changes with Word2vec, that is, we only reduced the SyncMap space dimension k from 3 to 2. Also, hierarchical clustering is used. 14 Regarding the hierarchical clustering, we used \u201cward\u201d as a linkage method. And we specified the number of clusters when performing the algorithm. In details, for the Lusseau\u2019s network of bottlenose dolphins, we set the \u201cnumber of clusters\u201d at 2. In the Zachary\u2019s karate club network, we set the \u201cnumber of clusters\u201d at 2 and 4 for computing NMI with two sets of ground-truth, respectively. C.2 RESULTS ANALYSIS SBM network. Modularity Max performs nearly optimal in this scenario. Also, recall that it yields relatively low NMI in fixed CGCP. The differences of the performance observed here might be because the communities with many deterministic connections are less likely to appear in usual problems faced by Modularity Max, thus leading to a problem bias; that is, fixed chunk structures are not strictly meet the condition that the possibility of transition to an internal state within a chunk is higher than that of transition to an external state belonging to other chunks. This leads to a problem bias for Modularity Max. Dolphins Network Dendrograms Karate Network Community detection benchmarks. Word2vec, as shown in Figure 9, always forms a latent representation with two long tails. This shape does harm when finding hierarchical structures. We have analyzed the two models of SyncMap in the main text. It is worth noting here that from the dendrograms of the original SyncMap, we can conclude that the original work is not possible to extract local relationships (i.e., hierarchies), as the nodes are all densely distributed in compact communities. Regarding the Modularity Max, it does not encode temporal sequences into a map space, and thus it is not figuratively visualized. Meanwhile, although the datasets here are designed for modularity-based models, Modularity Max failed to extract information and maximize the modularity from sequential data, thus showing lower NMI. D MAPS LEARNED BY DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS:  E STABILITY ANALYSIS: The proposed Symmetrical SyncMap shows good stability over the long run in all imbalanced chunking problems. Figures 11 and 12 show the NMI average with error bar (s.t.d.) at every 10,000 time step during training in all imbalanced problems. F PARAMETER SENSITIVITY ANAYLSIS: Table 2 shows the performance of Symmetrical SyncMap on the same imbalanced experiments (fixed/probabilistic/mixed 20-10-5 test) but with different parameters settings. Results suggest that Symmetrical SyncMap is robust to changes in parameters, with mostly smooth changes. Note that the parameter Pr is designed for solving small chunks. To illustrate, if Pr = 100%, then at every time step we apply state memory generalization to have a longer memory window. In this case, if the current chunk is too small (e.g., only having 3 states), then it would probably not be detected. Therefore, choosing Pr = 30% provides a trade-off between finding big and small chunks. In fact, in the future version of our model, this parameter will no longer be used, as tiny chunk/communities are rarely appear alone, while they usually appear inside a big chunk (i.e., hierarchies). Having said that, the results of using Pr = 100% and Pr = 30% are both adequate. G ALGORITHMIC DESCRIPTION OF SYMMETRICAL SYNCMAP:  H STATISTICAL TESTS: We used a t-test with p-value of 0.05 to verify if the best result is statistically significantly different from other results. h is the hypothesis test result (h=0 indicates a failure to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, and h=1 otherwise). p is the two-tailed p value, and ci is the confidence interval for the difference in population means of two samples. I RELATED WORKS: Chunking is an extremely multidisciplinary problem. In the main text, we attempt to cover a number of related topics from neuroscience to machine learning and try to connect them to this work. Due to the page limit, we review additional related works here for completeness. Latent Variable Estimation. Some literature focusing on latent variable estimation solve problems which are related to chunking (Fox et al., 2011; Qian & Aslin, 2014; Pfau et al., 2010). However, they have different objectives, since chunking is a self-organizing process over the variables of the problem with respect to their temporal correlation. Even if chunks of variables can be abstracted as a set of variables, there is still an inherent difference between chunks and latent variables. Unsupervised Learning for Sequences. Feature extraction is commonly used to predict future input in unsupervised learning for sequences (Clark et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2017; Mikolov et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2018). A peculiar learning algorithm called contrastive predictive encoding (CPE) has been proposed, which represents sequences by using a probabilistic contrastive loss in the latent space to encode maximally useful information (Hjelm et al., 2018). CPE solves problems which are complementary rather than competing with the problem presented here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Error generating response: 503 UNAVAILABLE. {'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

Without the full paper, including the precise mathematical formulation, objective function, and experimental details, this review will identify common pitfalls and critical areas of scrutiny for such an algorithm. My stance is highly critical, and I will highlight areas where a paper *would need to provide* rigorous justification to avoid outright rejection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review of the Symmetrical SyncMap Algorithm**\\n\\n**Overall Impression:** The concept of \\\"Symmetrical SyncMap\\\" suggests an evolution of a synchronization-based manifold learning or clustering algorithm, aiming to address potential asymmetries in its predecessor. While synchronization dynamics can offer intriguing computational paradigms, their application to static data representation requires meticulous justification. The term \\\"symmetrical\\\" is itself a double-edged sword: it could imply fundamental mathematical improvements or merely a superficial relabeling of standard practices.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **1. Technical Correctness**\\n\\nThis is the bedrock upon which any algorithm stands. My immediate concerns, without seeing the precise formulation, revolve around:\\n\\n*   **Definition of \\\"Symmetry\\\":** What *exactly* does \\\"symmetrical\\\" refer to?\\n    *   Is it merely a symmetric affinity/adjacency matrix ($W_{ij} = W_{ji}$)? If so, this is standard practice in graph-based methods (e.g., spectral clustering, Laplacian Eigenmaps) and hardly a novel contribution or a \\\"symmetrical\\\" *algorithm* in itself, only a symmetrical *input*.\\n    *   Does it refer to the *dynamics* of synchronization? E.g., that the influence of node $i$ on $j$ is precisely mirrored by $j$ on $i$ in the evolution equation for phases or states? If so, how is this enforced mathematically, and what does it buy you over an asymmetric system?\\n    *   Does it refer to the *objective function*? Is the underlying energy landscape (if one exists) symmetric or does it exhibit certain desirable symmetries (e.g., permutation invariance)?\\n    *   Does it refer to the *output embedding*? Is the embedding somehow symmetrically derived or robust to arbitrary rotations/reflections in a way its predecessor wasn't?\\n    *   **Demand:** The paper *must* provide an unambiguous, mathematically precise definition of \\\"symmetry\\\" within its context and demonstrate how it is enforced and leveraged.\\n\\n*   **Mathematical Model of Synchronization:**\\n    *   Is it based on Kuramoto oscillators, phase models, or another coupled system?\\n    *   **Natural Frequencies ($\\\\omega_i$):** A critical conceptual leap in applying Kuramoto-like models to *static data*. What are the \\\"natural frequencies\\\" of data points? Are they assumed to be zero (pure phase locking)? If not, how are they derived from the data? This is often a significant weakness in such approaches, as an arbitrary assignment can distort the embedding.\\n    *   **Coupling Function:** Why is a specific coupling function (e.g., $\\\\sin(\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i)$) chosen? What are its implications for the phase space and convergence? Does the \\\"symmetry\\\" affect this choice or enforce properties on it?\\n    *   **From Phases to Map:** How are the final synchronized phases ($\\\\theta_i$) translated into a low-dimensional embedding (e.g., 2D or 3D coordinates)? Is this mapping well-defined, unique, and does it preserve desired properties (e.g., local distances, global structure)? For instance, mapping phases directly to coordinates might mean a circular embedding, which isn't always desirable for arbitrary manifold structures. If it's done via spectral decomposition of a phase-derived matrix, the justification for this step needs to be strong.\\n\\n*   **Underlying Assumptions:** Are all assumptions (e.g., connectivity of the similarity graph, smoothness of the manifold, initial conditions for synchronization) clearly stated and justified? Are they realistic for typical machine learning datasets?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **2. Novelty**\\n\\nThis is where many \\\"new\\\" algorithms often fall short.\\n\\n*   **Beyond Symmetric Adjacency:** If \\\"Symmetrical SyncMap\\\" simply means using a symmetric adjacency matrix (which is standard for methods like Laplacian Eigenmaps, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), t-SNE, UMAP, etc.), then the *only* novelty lies in the *synchronization dynamics*. The paper *must* rigorously argue *why* solving a synchronization problem is superior or fundamentally different from other manifold learning or graph-based dimensionality reduction techniques that rely on symmetric matrices and direct optimization (e.g., spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian).\\n*   **Unique Contribution of \\\"Symmetry\\\":** What specific, *novel* mathematical or algorithmic benefits does this enforced symmetry provide that were absent in an asymmetric predecessor (if one exists) or in other non-synchronization methods?\\n    *   Does it guarantee a global optimum where an asymmetric version might not?\\n    *   Does it lead to faster convergence or more stable dynamics?\\n    *   Does it ensure a more meaningful or interpretable embedding?\\n    *   Does it enable a new theoretical analysis?\\n    *   **Demand:** Mere empirical improvements are insufficient here; the *mechanism* by which symmetry delivers these improvements needs to be explicitly detailed and, ideally, theoretically proven.\\n\\n*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** Novelty is also assessed against the current landscape. How does SSM differ fundamentally from other manifold learning algorithms (t-SNE, UMAP, Isomap, LLE, Spectral Embedding, etc.) and what unique problem does it solve that these methods cannot, or solve less effectively? A simple claim of \\\"better performance\\\" without explaining *why* it is better due to its unique mechanism is unconvincing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **3. Stability**\\n\\n*   **Dynamical System Stability:** Is the synchronization process inherently stable? Do the phases converge to fixed points, or can they exhibit complex behaviors like limit cycles, quasi-periodicity, or even chaos, especially for certain graph structures or coupling strengths? The Kuramoto model can indeed exhibit complex dynamics depending on parameters.\\n*   **Robustness to Parameters:** How sensitive is the final embedding to hyperparameter choices (e.g., graph construction parameters like k-NN, $\\\\epsilon$-radius, kernel width; synchronization dynamics parameters like integration step size, stopping criteria, initial conditions)? Minor parameter changes should not drastically alter the output.\\n*   **Robustness to Data Perturbations:** How does SSM handle noise, outliers, missing data, or slight variations in the input dataset? Does the \\\"symmetry\\\" enhance this robustness?\\n*   **Numerical Stability:** Are the numerical integration schemes (if applicable) stable? Are there potential issues with very large or very small coupling strengths?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **4. Convergence Properties**\\n\\nThis is often the weakest point for algorithms based on complex dynamics.\\n\\n*   **Guaranteed Convergence:** Does the algorithm *guarantee* convergence of the synchronization process? Under what conditions (e.g., graph connectivity, specific coupling, initial conditions)?\\n    *   For a system like Kuramoto, convergence to a fully synchronized state (all phases identical) is only guaranteed under specific conditions (e.g., strong coupling, small frequency differences). Is full synchronization the goal, or merely phase locking?\\n*   **Convergence to What?** If it converges, does it converge to a global optimum of an objective function, or merely a local one? If it's a local optimum, how many are there, and how can one escape them or find a \\\"good\\\" one? What does this \\\"optimum\\\" represent in terms of data structure?\\n*   **Speed of Convergence:** How many iterations (or simulation time) are typically required for convergence? Does this scale well with the number of data points ($N$)?\\n*   **Dependence on Initial Conditions:** Does the final embedding depend heavily on the initial random phase assignments? This would be a significant flaw, indicating non-uniqueness and poor reproducibility. The \\\"symmetrical\\\" aspect *should* ideally reduce this dependence.\\n*   **Disconnected Components:** If the similarity graph has disconnected components, do they synchronize independently? How does this impact the global embedding, or does it implicitly perform clustering? If so, is it better than explicit clustering methods?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **5. Computational Complexity**\\n\\nScalability is paramount for modern ML algorithms.\\n\\n*   **Graph Construction:** What is the complexity of building the initial similarity graph? For $N$ data points, $O(N^2)$ for all-pairs distances, or $O(N \\\\log N)$ for k-NN search using optimized data structures (e.g., k-d trees).\\n*   **Synchronization Dynamics:** This is likely the bottleneck. If $T$ is the number of iterations/time steps and $K$ is the average degree of a node:\\n    *   Each iteration involves computing interactions for all $N$ nodes. If sparse, this is $O(N \\\\cdot K)$. So, total is $O(T \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot K)$.\\n    *   What are typical values for $T$? Can $T$ be very large for complex datasets or weak coupling?\\n    *   How does $K$ scale with $N$?\\n*   **Embedding Extraction:** The complexity of deriving the final coordinates from synchronized phases. This could range from $O(N)$ to $O(N^2)$ depending on the method (e.g., if it involves a spectral decomposition of a phase-derived matrix).\\n*   **Overall Scalability:** Can the algorithm scale to datasets with $10^5$, $10^6$, or more data points? Are there approximations (e.g., subsampling, batch updates, Nystr\u00f6m approximation) that maintain quality while reducing complexity?\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Is the algorithm memory-efficient, especially for large $N$ and dense graphs?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **6. Methodological Justification / Flaws**\\n\\nBeyond the specific technical aspects, there are overarching methodological concerns:\\n\\n*   **The Core \\\"Why\\\":** The most critical question for *any* synchronization-based learning algorithm: **Why use synchronization dynamics instead of direct optimization techniques?** What unique computational advantages or insights does this paradigm offer that traditional gradient descent on an explicit objective function does not? Is it more robust, inherently parallel, or does it unveil properties difficult to capture otherwise? A compelling answer is essential. \\\"It works\\\" is insufficient.\\n*   **Interpretability:** What do the synchronized states *mean* in the context of the data? What do the resulting low-dimensional coordinates represent? How can one interpret the learned map?\\n*   **Empirical Evaluation Rigor:**\\n    *   **Datasets:** Are the datasets diverse and challenging (e.g., high-dimensional, complex topology, varying densities)?\\n    *   **Baselines:** Is SSM compared against a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques, not just its predecessor or basic methods?\\n    *   **Metrics:** Are appropriate quantitative metrics used (e.g., trustworthiness, continuity, neighborhood preservation for embeddings; ARI, NMI for clustering capabilities if applicable)? Visualizations are good but not enough.\\n    *   **Statistical Significance:** Are results averaged over multiple runs (especially if sensitive to initialization) and accompanied by confidence intervals or statistical tests?\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** If \\\"symmetry\\\" is a key feature, are there experiments showing its specific impact compared to a non-symmetrical version, or other design choices?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Conclusion and Recommendation**\\n\\nBased purely on the conceptual understanding of \\\"Symmetrical SyncMap\\\" and common pitfalls in this class of algorithms, a submission detailing this algorithm would require **Major Revisions** and could very well face **Rejection** if the identified issues are not rigorously addressed.\\n\\n**For a positive recommendation, the paper would absolutely need to:**\\n\\n1.  **Precisely define \\\"Symmetry\\\"** and clearly demonstrate its mathematical enforcement throughout the algorithm (graph construction, dynamics, embedding).\\n2.  **Provide a compelling theoretical justification** for *why* synchronization is the chosen paradigm, especially compared to direct optimization methods in manifold learning. What unique problem does it solve, or what unique property does it exploit?\\n3.  **Rigorously demonstrate the novel contribution** of \\\"symmetry\\\" beyond simply using a symmetric affinity matrix, with clear mathematical proofs or strong theoretical arguments for its benefits (e.g., convergence guarantees, stability improvements, global optimality properties).\\n4.  **Thoroughly analyze stability and convergence properties**, ideally with theoretical guarantees, or at least extensive empirical analysis of parameter sensitivity and reproducibility.\\n5.  **Present a detailed computational complexity analysis** and discuss scalability strategies for large datasets.\\n6.  **Conduct an exhaustive empirical evaluation** against state-of-the-art baselines on diverse datasets, using appropriate metrics and statistical rigor, and clearly explaining *why* SSM performs as it does based on its underlying mechanism.\\n\\nWithout robust answers to these points, Symmetrical SyncMap risks being perceived as an ad-hoc method lacking deep theoretical grounding or significant practical advantage over established techniques.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9263656\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"MethodReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the Symmetrical SyncMap algorithm, focusing on its technical correctness, novelty, stability, convergence properties, and computational complexity.

The devil is in the details of the experimental design, the chosen baselines, and the evaluation metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Effectiveness of Symmetrical SyncMap in Handling Imbalanced CGCPs**\\n\\n1.  **Understanding \\\"Imbalanced CGCPs\\\":**\\n    *   The first critical point is how the paper defines \\\"imbalanced CGCPs.\\\" Does it refer to:\\n        *   **Cluster Size Imbalance:** Some clusters are significantly smaller than others? (This is the most common interpretation in clustering).\\n        *   **Class Imbalance within Clusters:** If nodes have ground-truth labels *and* belong to clusters, are some classes within those clusters under-represented?\\n        *   **Imbalance in Graph Structure:** e.g., sparse connectivity for certain node types/groups?\\n    *   The method's theoretical grounding should explain *how* Symmetrical SyncMap's core mechanics (symmetry, synchronization, mapping) inherently or explicitly handle this specific type of imbalance. Does it involve:\\n        *   Cost-sensitive learning/weighting?\\n        *   Specialized sampling (e.g., oversampling minority clusters, undersampling majority)?\\n        *   A loss function robust to class/cluster imbalance (e.g., focal loss, balanced loss)?\\n        *   A mechanism that prevents smaller clusters from being absorbed or ignored by larger ones during the optimization process?\\n    *   **Without a clear theoretical explanation of its imbalance-handling mechanism, any observed superior performance on imbalanced data might be coincidental or due to general algorithmic strength, rather than a targeted solution.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Analysis of Experimental Results on Imbalanced Datasets & Comparison with Existing Methods**\\n\\nAssuming a typical experimental setup, here's what I'd look for and how I'd evaluate it:\\n\\n**Strengths (If Present):**\\n\\n1.  **Multiple Imbalanced Datasets:** A good study would use several diverse, real-world datasets known to exhibit cluster or class imbalance, ideally with varying imbalance ratios.\\n2.  **Clear Definition of Imbalance:** For each dataset, quantifying the imbalance (e.g., imbalance ratio, distribution of cluster sizes) is crucial.\\n3.  **Visualization of Clusters:** Visualizing the resulting clusters (if feasible for smaller graphs) could qualitatively demonstrate how well smaller clusters are preserved.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Concerns (Common Pitfalls & Why They Lead to Rejection):**\\n\\n1.  **Inadequate Baselines for Imbalance:**\\n    *   **Major Red Flag:** If the baselines only include general-purpose CGCP or clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Spectral Clustering, Louvain, Infomap, general graph neural networks for clustering), without *any* specific adaptation for imbalance. These methods are *known* to struggle with imbalance (e.g., K-means gravitating towards larger clusters). Showing a slight improvement over them on imbalanced data is not convincing proof of handling imbalance; it merely shows it's a slightly better general algorithm.\\n    *   **Required Baselines:** The comparison *must* include state-of-the-art methods designed or adapted for imbalanced clustering/classification, such as:\\n        *   Clustering algorithms augmented with *oversampling* (e.g., SMOTE for features, if applicable) or *undersampling*.\\n        *   Cost-sensitive clustering algorithms (if they exist for CGCPs).\\n        *   Ensemble clustering methods that inherently handle diversity or imbalance (e.g., Bagging/Boosting variants applied to clustering).\\n        *   Self-training or semi-supervised approaches that might leverage small amounts of labeled data to guide clustering of minority groups.\\n2.  **Insufficient Evaluation Metrics for Imbalance:**\\n    *   **Major Red Flag:** Sole reliance on overall accuracy, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), or Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI). While useful, these metrics are often biased towards majority classes/clusters in imbalanced settings. A method can achieve high overall NMI by perfectly clustering large groups while completely failing on small ones.\\n    *   **Required Metrics:**\\n        *   **Balanced Accuracy:** Average recall per class/cluster.\\n        *   **Macro F1-score:** Averaging F1-scores for each class/cluster, giving equal weight to small and large ones.\\n        *   **Recall/Precision specifically for minority clusters/classes:** Explicitly show how well the smallest clusters are identified and how pure they are.\\n        *   **G-mean:** Geometric mean of recall for all classes/clusters, sensitive to poor performance on any single class.\\n        *   **Per-cluster performance breakdown:** Tables or graphs showing NMI/F1/P/R for *each* ground-truth cluster, highlighting performance on the smallest ones.\\n3.  **Lack of Varied Imbalance Ratios:** Experiments should ideally explore how performance changes as the degree of imbalance increases. A method might work for mild imbalance but fail dramatically under extreme imbalance.\\n4.  **No Statistical Significance Testing:** Without statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) across multiple runs and datasets, claiming superiority is anecdotal.\\n5.  **Ablation Studies for Imbalance-Handling Components:** If Symmetrical SyncMap has specific components theorized to address imbalance, an ablation study showing the impact of removing or modifying these components on imbalanced datasets would be highly convincing.\\n6.  **Parameter Tuning Fairness:** Ensure that all compared methods (especially baselines) are tuned fairly and optimally for each dataset. Suboptimal tuning of baselines can artificially inflate the proposed method's performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Assessment: Do the Experiments Sufficiently Demonstrate the Algorithm's Advantage in Imbalanced Scenarios?**\\n\\n**Likely Answer: NO, if the common pitfalls are present.**\\n\\nIf the paper primarily uses standard clustering metrics (NMI, ARI) and compares only against general-purpose clustering algorithms, it *does not* sufficiently demonstrate an advantage in imbalanced scenarios. Such experiments only show that Symmetrical SyncMap is a generally competent clustering algorithm, possibly slightly better, but not that it specifically *solves* the inherent challenges of imbalanced data.\\n\\nTo sufficiently demonstrate the advantage, the experiments *must* go beyond general performance metrics and baselines. They need to directly confront the problem of imbalance through specific metrics and by outperforming methods *designed* or *adapted* for imbalance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Specific Feedback on Experimental Design and Results (Recommendations for Improvement)**\\n\\n1.  **Clarify and Quantify \\\"Imbalance\\\":**\\n    *   Explicitly define what constitutes \\\"imbalance\\\" in the context of CGCPs.\\n    *   For each dataset, provide a detailed breakdown of cluster sizes, and ideally, an \\\"imbalance ratio\\\" metric (e.g., size of largest cluster / size of smallest cluster).\\n2.  **Strengthen Baselines:**\\n    *   **Crucial:** Include methods that explicitly address imbalance in clustering or classification tasks (e.g., density-based methods less sensitive to cluster size, methods incorporating over/undersampling strategies like SMOTE/ADASYN if applicable to feature vectors, cost-sensitive clustering algorithms, or ensemble approaches that can handle diverse cluster sizes).\\n    *   If no direct imbalance-aware CGCP methods exist, show how standard methods perform *after* applying imbalance-handling techniques (e.g., run a baseline method on an oversampled graph/features, if reasonable).\\n3.  **Adopt Imbalance-Sensitive Metrics:**\\n    *   Replace or heavily supplement overall NMI/ARI with **Balanced Accuracy, Macro F1-score, G-mean**, and detailed **recall/precision/F1 for minority clusters**.\\n    *   Present confusion matrices or per-cluster performance tables to vividly illustrate how well the smaller clusters are handled.\\n4.  **Vary Imbalance Ratios:**\\n    *   If possible, create or select datasets with a range of imbalance ratios to show the robustness of Symmetrical SyncMap as imbalance severity increases.\\n5.  **Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   Run all experiments multiple times (e.g., 30 runs) with different random seeds.\\n    *   Report mean and standard deviation.\\n    *   Perform non-parametric statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test or Friedman test with Nemenyi post-hoc test) to establish statistical significance of performance differences.\\n6.  **Ablation Study (if applicable):**\\n    *   If the method has specific components claimed to address imbalance, conduct an ablation study to show their individual contribution to performance on imbalanced datasets. This helps confirm the *reason* for observed improvements.\\n7.  **Qualitative Analysis:**\\n    *   For smaller graphs, visualize the clustering results, highlighting how well Symmetrical SyncMap preserves small, isolated, or difficult-to-find clusters compared to baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion and Recommendation**\\n\\nBased on the typical shortcomings in such papers, my recommendation would likely be:\\n\\n**REJECT (or Major Revision if the core idea is novel and promising but experimental validation is weak).**\\n\\n**Reasoning:** Without a clear theoretical basis for how Symmetrical SyncMap addresses imbalance, and without rigorous experimental validation using appropriate baselines and metrics specifically designed for imbalanced data, the claim of effectiveness in handling imbalanced CGCPs remains unsubstantiated. Merely showing better performance on some \\\"imbalanced datasets\\\" with general metrics and non-imbalance-aware baselines is insufficient to justify such a claim. The experiments would need to be significantly revamped to directly and thoroughly test the algorithm's performance on the *imbalance aspect* of the problem.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.9255241\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ImbalanceReviewer\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the effectiveness of the Symmetrical SyncMap method in handling imbalanced CGCPs.

My assessment will focus on whether its proposed mechanisms genuinely embody self-organization and effectively address the ambitious claim of uncovering hierarchical topologies, alongside its biological relevance and practical utility.\\n\\n**Assessment of Self-Organizing Properties:**\\n\\nFor a system to be truly self-organizing, it should exhibit the following characteristics:\\n1.  **Local Interactions:** Global order emerges from purely local interactions between components, without centralized control.\\n2.  **Adaptation & Emergence:** The system adapts to its environment (input data) and develops a global structure or pattern that was not explicitly programmed but *emerges* from the local rules.\\n3.  **Robustness:** The emergent order is robust to perturbations or noise.\\n4.  **Dissipative Processes:** Often involves energy dissipation or information flow leading to a stable state or attractor.\\n\\nBased on the premise of a \\\"SyncMap,\\\" particularly \\\"Symmetrical\\\":\\n\\n*   **Strength in Local Interactions & Emergence:** The very core idea of nodes \\\"synchronizing\\\" implies local interactions. Each node (representing a data point or a position in the map) would likely adjust its state (e.g., phase, frequency, or position) based on its relationship (similarity, distance) to its neighbors in the data space and/or its projection in the map space. This distributed, local adjustment leading to a coherent global \\\"map\\\" is a strong indicator of self-organization. The \\\"symmetrical\\\" aspect likely reinforces the bidirectional influence, leading to more stable and consistent map formation, a common property in self-organizing neural networks (e.g., Kohonen maps, where competition and cooperation between neurons define the map).\\n*   **Adaptive Dynamics:** The map \\\"learns\\\" or \\\"adapts\\\" to the underlying manifold of the input data. As synchronization processes converge, the map units (or neurons) should settle into positions that reflect the topology and density of the input data, thus achieving a form of data-driven adaptation.\\n*   **Implicit Objective Function:** Self-organizing maps often implicitly minimize a global energy function (e.g., distortion error in SOMs, or embedding stress). For SyncMap, this might be related to minimizing \\\"phase discord\\\" or maximizing \\\"synchronization coherence\\\" across the map, which would drive the units to topologically meaningful positions.\\n\\n**However, the depth of self-organization depends heavily on the specific update rules.** If the updates are purely iterative gradient descents on a predefined global objective, while adaptive, it's less \\\"emergent\\\" than systems where the rules themselves are simpler and the global behavior more surprising. A truly self-organizing SyncMap would have very simple, biologically plausible local rules that lead to complex map formation without explicitly calculating a global error.\\n\\n**Ability to Uncover Complex Hierarchical Topologies:**\\n\\nThis is the most ambitious claim and requires significant scrutiny. Most manifold learning techniques (t-SNE, UMAP, LLE, traditional SOMs) excel at preserving local neighborhood structures and projecting data onto a *flat* manifold, or discovering *clusters*. Uncovering *hierarchy* is a different beast.\\n\\n*   **How could SyncMap achieve this?**\\n    *   **Multi-scale Synchronization:** One potential mechanism is if the synchronization process itself operates at multiple scales or resolutions. For instance, coarse-grained synchronization could identify top-level clusters, while finer-grained synchronization within those clusters could reveal sub-hierarchies. This would require specific algorithmic design for multi-resolution dynamics or a nested application of the SyncMap principle.\\n    *   **Emergent Hierarchical Clustering:** The SyncMap might naturally arrange points such that clusters and sub-clusters become apparent in the low-dimensional map. However, this is often an *interpretation* of the resulting map rather than an *explicit construction* of a hierarchy by the algorithm itself. To truly \\\"uncover\\\" hierarchy, the algorithm should output not just a projection, but also a tree structure or nested relationships.\\n    *   **Challenges:** If SyncMap merely projects data onto a 2D or 3D manifold, the hierarchy would need to be *inferred* from the proximity and density of points, possibly requiring an additional clustering or hierarchical clustering algorithm post-hoc. A strong claim about \\\"uncovering\\\" hierarchy implies the algorithm *itself* yields this hierarchical structure directly. This would be a significant differentiator from many existing manifold learning techniques. The paper must clearly demonstrate how hierarchical levels or relationships are explicitly represented or extracted during the synchronization process, not just as a visual byproduct.\\n\\n**Biological Plausibility:**\\n\\n*   **Strong Foundation:** The concept of synchronization is highly biologically plausible. Neural systems exhibit widespread oscillatory dynamics and synchronize activity across various scales (from local field potentials to brain-wide networks).\\n    *   **Neural Oscillations:** Synchronization of neural oscillations (e.g., gamma, theta rhythms) is implicated in binding, attention, memory, and information processing. A SyncMap could be seen as a computational model where data points are \\\"neurons\\\" and their relationships are \\\"synaptic connections,\\\" with synchronized states representing coherent perceptual or cognitive states.\\n    *   **Hebbian-like Learning:** The local adjustment rules could mimic Hebbian plasticity (\\\"neurons that fire together, wire together\\\") or other forms of synaptic plasticity, where the strength of connections or the similarity of states is reinforced through co-activity.\\n    *   **Self-Organizing Maps in Biology:** The brain's somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices develop self-organizing topographic maps based on sensory input, exhibiting similar principles of local competitive and cooperative learning.\\n*   **Potential Weaknesses:** While the general inspiration is strong, the specific details matter. Is it too simplistic? Does it account for sparse coding, inhibitory mechanisms, or energy efficiency often found in biological neural networks? Does it model *how* the brain maps information, or just borrow the *idea* of synchronization for a different purpose? For true biological plausibility, the model should ideally offer testable predictions or insights into neural computation. If it's merely *inspired* by biology without contributing to our understanding of it, the \\\"biological plausibility\\\" argument becomes weaker from a scientific standpoint.\\n\\n**Potential for Real-World Applications:**\\n\\nGiven its potential properties, Symmetrical SyncMap could be highly valuable for:\\n\\n*   **Data Visualization & Exploration:** For complex, high-dimensional datasets, it could create intuitive 2D/3D maps that preserve inherent data structure, making hidden patterns, clusters, and outliers easily discernible. This is especially useful in fields like bioinformatics, social network analysis, and sensor data processing.\\n*   **Unsupervised Learning & Clustering:** If it effectively forms coherent maps, it could serve as a robust clustering algorithm, where clusters correspond to regions of high synchronization or density in the map. Its potential for hierarchical topology discovery would be a significant advantage here.\\n*   **Novelty/Anomaly Detection:** Outliers or anomalous data points would likely fail to synchronize strongly with the main body of the map, or map to isolated regions, making them easy to detect.\\n*   **Manifold Learning:** As a competitor to t-SNE, UMAP, and LLE, it could offer a novel approach to learning the intrinsic manifold of complex data, potentially with better preservation of global structure due to the \\\"symmetrical\\\" and synchronization-driven nature.\\n*   **Biological Data Analysis:** Given its biological inspiration, it could be particularly suited for analyzing complex biological datasets (e.g., gene expression, neural recordings, protein interaction networks) where underlying hierarchical and topological structures are often hypothesized.\\n\\n**Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:**\\n\\n1.  **Explicit Hierarchy Mechanism:** The primary weakness is the strong claim of uncovering \\\"complex hierarchical topologies.\\\" This needs to be rigorously demonstrated. Does the algorithm *construct* a hierarchy, or merely produce a map from which one can be *inferred*? If it's the latter, the claim should be tempered. If it's the former, the specific algorithmic steps for hierarchy extraction are crucial.\\n2.  **Scalability:** Synchronization algorithms can be computationally intensive, especially for very large datasets ($N$ data points) and high dimensionality ($D$ features). The paper needs to demonstrate its scalability against state-of-the-art methods.\\n3.  **Parameter Sensitivity:** How many hyperparameters does it have, and how sensitive is the map formation to them? Self-organizing systems ideally require minimal tuning.\\n4.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** Are there theoretical guarantees on convergence, stability, and the fidelity of the topological preservation?\\n5.  **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** A strong evaluation requires benchmarking against well-established manifold learning, clustering, and hierarchical clustering algorithms to demonstrate superior or complementary performance.\\n\\n**Conclusion/Recommendation:**\\n\\nThe Symmetrical SyncMap presents a compelling conceptual framework rooted in biologically plausible self-organizing principles. The idea of leveraging synchronization for manifold learning is intrinsically appealing and holds promise for robust data mapping and visualization, exhibiting strong self-organizing properties in its local interactions and emergent global structure.\\n\\nHowever, the audacious claim of explicitly \\\"uncovering complex hierarchical topologies\\\" requires substantial and concrete evidence. If the algorithm merely produces a low-dimensional embedding where hierarchical *interpretation* is possible, it is not a direct \\\"uncovering\\\" mechanism. The biological inspiration is strong in its conceptual appeal, but its utility as a scientific model of brain function needs to be clearly differentiated from its use as an engineering solution *inspired* by biology.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** I would **not reject** the paper outright based on the description, as the core concept of a synchronization-based self-organizing map is highly valuable and biologically inspired. However, I would strongly recommend **major revisions**. The paper must:\\n\\n*   **Rigorously detail and demonstrate the specific mechanism by which it *uncovers* hierarchical topologies.** This is paramount. Does it build a tree? Does it output multi-resolution maps? If it just creates a flat map, this claim needs to be significantly toned down.\\n*   **Provide a more in-depth analysis of its self-organizing dynamics beyond just stating it uses synchronization.** How do local rules lead to global convergence? What are the dynamics of this process?\\n*   **Clearly articulate its contribution compared to existing manifold learning and hierarchical clustering techniques.**\\n*   **Address scalability and hyperparameter sensitivity with empirical results.**\\n\\nWithout a clear and demonstrable mechanism for hierarchical discovery, the SyncMap would primarily be evaluated as another manifold learning technique, albeit one with an interesting self-organizing foundation.

My stance is highly critical, and I will highlight areas where a paper *would need to provide* rigorous justification to avoid outright rejection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review of the Symmetrical SyncMap Algorithm**\\n\\n**Overall Impression:** The concept of \"Symmetrical SyncMap\" suggests an evolution of a synchronization-based manifold learning or clustering algorithm, aiming to address potential asymmetries in its predecessor. While synchronization dynamics can offer intriguing computational paradigms, their application to static data representation requires meticulous justification. The term \"symmetrical\" is itself a double-edged sword: it could imply fundamental mathematical improvements or merely a superficial relabeling of standard practices.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **1. Technical Correctness**\\n\\nThis is the bedrock upon which any algorithm stands. My immediate concerns, without seeing the precise formulation, revolve around:\\n\\n*   **Definition of \"Symmetry\":** What *exactly* does \"symmetrical\" refer to?\\n    *   Is it merely a symmetric affinity/adjacency matrix ($W_{ij} = W_{ji}$)? If so, this is standard practice in graph-based methods (e.g., spectral clustering, Laplacian Eigenmaps) and hardly a novel contribution or a \"symmetrical\" *algorithm* in itself, only a symmetrical *input*.\\n    *   Does it refer to the *dynamics* of synchronization? E.g., that the influence of node $i$ on $j$ is precisely mirrored by $j$ on $i$ in the evolution equation for phases or states? If so, how is this enforced mathematically, and what does it buy you over an asymmetric system?\\n    *   Does it refer to the *objective function*? Is the underlying energy landscape (if one exists) symmetric or does it exhibit certain desirable symmetries (e.g., permutation invariance)?\\n    *   Does it refer to the *output embedding*? Is the embedding somehow symmetrically derived or robust to arbitrary rotations/reflections in a way its predecessor wasn\\'t?\\n    *   **Demand:** The paper *must* provide an unambiguous, mathematically precise definition of \"symmetry\" within its context and demonstrate how it is enforced and leveraged.\\n\\n*   **Mathematical Model of Synchronization:**\\n    *   Is it based on Kuramoto oscillators, phase models, or another coupled system?\\n    *   **Natural Frequencies ($\\\\omega_i$):** A critical conceptual leap in applying Kuramoto-like models to *static data*. What are the \"natural frequencies\" of data points? Are they assumed to be zero (pure phase locking)? If not, how are they derived from the data? This is often a significant weakness in such approaches, as an arbitrary assignment can distort the embedding.\\n    *   **Coupling Function:** Why is a specific coupling function (e.g., $\\\\sin(\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i)$) chosen? What are its implications for the phase space and convergence? Does the \"symmetry\" affect this choice or enforce properties on it?\\n    *   **From Phases to Map:** How are the final synchronized phases ($\\\\theta_i$) translated into a low-dimensional embedding (e.g., 2D or 3D coordinates)? Is this mapping well-defined, unique, and does it preserve desired properties (e.g., local distances, global structure)? For instance, mapping phases directly to coordinates might mean a circular embedding, which isn\\'t always desirable for arbitrary manifold structures. If it\\'s done via spectral decomposition of a phase-derived matrix, the justification for this step needs to be strong.\\n\\n*   **Underlying Assumptions:** Are all assumptions (e.g., connectivity of the similarity graph, smoothness of the manifold, initial conditions for synchronization) clearly stated and justified? Are they realistic for typical machine learning datasets?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **2. Novelty**\\n\\nThis is where many \"new\" algorithms often fall short.\\n\\n*   **Beyond Symmetric Adjacency:** If \"Symmetrical SyncMap\" simply means using a symmetric adjacency matrix (which is standard for methods like Laplacian Eigenmaps, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), t-SNE, UMAP, etc.), then the *only* novelty lies in the *synchronization dynamics*. The paper *must* rigorously argue *why* solving a synchronization problem is superior or fundamentally different from other manifold learning or graph-based dimensionality reduction techniques that rely on symmetric matrices and direct optimization (e.g., spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian).\\n*   **Unique Contribution of \"Symmetry\":** What specific, *novel* mathematical or algorithmic benefits does this enforced symmetry provide that were absent in an asymmetric predecessor (if one exists) or in other non-synchronization methods?\\n    *   Does it guarantee a global optimum where an asymmetric version might not?\\n    *   Does it lead to faster convergence or more stable dynamics?\\n    *   Does it ensure a more meaningful or interpretable embedding?\\n    *   Does it enable a new theoretical analysis?\\n    *   **Demand:** Mere empirical improvements are insufficient here; the *mechanism* by which symmetry delivers these improvements needs to be explicitly detailed and, ideally, theoretically proven.\\n\\n*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** Novelty is also assessed against the current landscape. How does SSM differ fundamentally from other manifold learning algorithms (t-SNE, UMAP, Isomap, LLE, Spectral Embedding, etc.) and what unique problem does it solve that these methods cannot, or solve less effectively? A simple claim of \"better performance\" without explaining *why* it is better due to its unique mechanism is unconvincing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **3. Stability**\\n\\n*   **Dynamical System Stability:** Is the synchronization process inherently stable? Do the phases converge to fixed points, or can they exhibit complex behaviors like limit cycles, quasi-periodicity, or even chaos, especially for certain graph structures or coupling strengths? The Kuramoto model can indeed exhibit complex dynamics depending on parameters.\\n*   **Robustness to Parameters:** How sensitive is the final embedding to hyperparameter choices (e.g., graph construction parameters like k-NN, $\\\\epsilon$-radius, kernel width; synchronization dynamics parameters like integration step size, stopping criteria, initial conditions)? Minor parameter changes should not drastically alter the output.\\n*   **Robustness to Data Perturbations:** How does SSM handle noise, outliers, missing data, or slight variations in the input dataset? Does the \"symmetry\" enhance this robustness?\\n*   **Numerical Stability:** Are the numerical integration schemes (if applicable) stable? Are there potential issues with very large or very small coupling strengths?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **4. Convergence Properties**\\n\\nThis is often the weakest point for algorithms based on complex dynamics.\\n\\n*   **Guaranteed Convergence:** Does the algorithm *guarantee* convergence of the synchronization process? Under what conditions (e.g., graph connectivity, specific coupling, initial conditions)?\\n    *   For a system like Kuramoto, convergence to a fully synchronized state (all phases identical) is only guaranteed under specific conditions (e.g., strong coupling, small frequency differences). Is full synchronization the goal, or merely phase locking?\\n*   **Convergence to What?** If it converges, does it converge to a global optimum of an objective function, or merely a local one? If it\\'s a local optimum, how many are there, and how can one escape them or find a \"good\" one? What does this \"optimum\" represent in terms of data structure?\\n*   **Speed of Convergence:** How many iterations (or simulation time) are typically required for convergence? Does this scale well with the number of data points ($N$)?\\n*   **Dependence on Initial Conditions:** Does the final embedding depend heavily on the initial random phase assignments? This would be a significant flaw, indicating non-uniqueness and poor reproducibility. The \"symmetrical\" aspect *should* ideally reduce this dependence.\\n*   **Disconnected Components:** If the similarity graph has disconnected components, do they synchronize independently? How does this impact the global embedding, or does it implicitly perform clustering? If so, is it better than explicit clustering methods?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **5. Computational Complexity**\\n\\nScalability is paramount for modern ML algorithms.\\n\\n*   **Graph Construction:** What is the complexity of building the initial similarity graph? For $N$ data points, $O(N^2)$ for all-pairs distances, or $O(N \\\\log N)$ for k-NN search using optimized data structures (e.g., k-d trees).\\n*   **Synchronization Dynamics:** This is likely the bottleneck. If $T$ is the number of iterations/time steps and $K$ is the average degree of a node:\\n    *   Each iteration involves computing interactions for all $N$ nodes. If sparse, this is $O(N \\\\cdot K)$. So, total is $O(T \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot K)$.\\n    *   What are typical values for $T$? Can $T$ be very large for complex datasets or weak coupling?\\n    *   How does $K$ scale with $N$?\\n*   **Embedding Extraction:** The complexity of deriving the final coordinates from synchronized phases. This could range from $O(N)$ to $O(N^2)$ depending on the method (e.g., if it involves a spectral decomposition of a phase-derived matrix).\\n*   **Overall Scalability:** Can the algorithm scale to datasets with $10^5$, $10^6$, or more data points? Are there approximations (e.g., subsampling, batch updates, Nystr\u00f6m approximation) that maintain quality while reducing complexity?\\n*   **Memory Footprint:** Is the algorithm memory-efficient, especially for large $N$ and dense graphs?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **6. Methodological Justification / Flaws**\\n\\nBeyond the specific technical aspects, there are overarching methodological concerns:\\n\\n*   **The Core \"Why\":** The most critical question for *any* synchronization-based learning algorithm: **Why use synchronization dynamics instead of direct optimization techniques?** What unique computational advantages or insights does this paradigm offer that traditional gradient descent on an explicit objective function does not? Is it more robust, inherently parallel, or does it unveil properties difficult to capture otherwise? A compelling answer is essential. \"It works\" is insufficient.\\n*   **Interpretability:** What do the synchronized states *mean* in the context of the data? What do the resulting low-dimensional coordinates represent? How can one interpret the learned map?\\n*   **Empirical Evaluation Rigor:**\\n    *   **Datasets:** Are the datasets diverse and challenging (e.g., high-dimensional, complex topology, varying densities)?\\n    *   **Baselines:** Is SSM compared against a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques, not just its predecessor or basic methods?\\n    *   **Metrics:** Are appropriate quantitative metrics used (e.g., trustworthiness, continuity, neighborhood preservation for embeddings; ARI, NMI for clustering capabilities if applicable)? Visualizations are good but not enough.\\n    *   **Statistical Significance:** Are results averaged over multiple runs (especially if sensitive to initialization) and accompanied by confidence intervals or statistical tests?\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** If \"symmetry\" is a key feature, are there experiments showing its specific impact compared to a non-symmetrical version, or other design choices?\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Conclusion and Recommendation**\\n\\nBased purely on the conceptual understanding of \"Symmetrical SyncMap\" and common pitfalls in this class of algorithms, a submission detailing this algorithm would require **Major Revisions** and could very well face **Rejection** if the identified issues are not rigorously addressed.\\n\\n**For a positive recommendation, the paper would absolutely need to:**\\n\\n1.  **Precisely define \"Symmetry\"** and clearly demonstrate its mathematical enforcement throughout the algorithm (graph construction, dynamics, embedding).\\n2.  **Provide a compelling theoretical justification** for *why* synchronization is the chosen paradigm, especially compared to direct optimization methods in manifold learning. What unique problem does it solve, or what unique property does it exploit?\\n3.  **Rigorously demonstrate the novel contribution** of \"symmetry\" beyond simply using a symmetric affinity matrix, with clear mathematical proofs or strong theoretical arguments for its benefits (e.g., convergence guarantees, stability improvements, global optimality properties).\\n4.  **Thoroughly analyze stability and convergence properties**, ideally with theoretical guarantees, or at least extensive empirical analysis of parameter sensitivity and reproducibility.\\n5.  **Present a detailed computational complexity analysis** and discuss scalability strategies for large datasets.\\n6.  **Conduct an exhaustive empirical evaluation** against state-of-the-art baselines on diverse datasets, using appropriate metrics and statistical rigor, and clearly explaining *why* SSM performs as it does based on its underlying mechanism.\\n\\nWithout robust answers to these points, Symmetrical SyncMap risks being perceived as an ad-hoc method lacking deep theoretical grounding or significant practical advantage over established techniques.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.9263656}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'As a specialist in imbalanced data problems, I approach this evaluation with a critical eye, focusing on whether the proposed Symmetrical SyncMap method genuinely addresses the challenges posed by imbalanced Complex Graph Clustering Problems (CGCPs) and whether the experimental evidence rigorously supports its claims.\\n\\nFor a method to be considered effective in handling imbalanced data, it must demonstrate not just general good performance, but specific resilience and superior performance on the minority or under-represented components of the data, using appropriate metrics and against strong, imbalance-aware baselines.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the evaluation:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment (Initial Thesis)**\\n\\nBased on the prompt, the key is to determine if the experiments *sufficiently* demonstrate the algorithm\\'s advantage in imbalanced scenarios. My initial stance is skeptical, as many papers claim to handle imbalance without truly robust experimental validation. The devil is in the details of the experimental design, the chosen baselines, and the evaluation metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Effectiveness of Symmetrical SyncMap in Handling Imbalanced CGCPs**\\n\\n1.  **Understanding \"Imbalanced CGCPs\":**\\n    *   The first critical point is how the paper defines \"imbalanced CGCPs.\" Does it refer to:\\n        *   **Cluster Size Imbalance:** Some clusters are significantly smaller than others? (This is the most common interpretation in clustering).\\n        *   **Class Imbalance within Clusters:** If nodes have ground-truth labels *and* belong to clusters, are some classes within those clusters under-represented?\\n        *   **Imbalance in Graph Structure:** e.g., sparse connectivity for certain node types/groups?\\n    *   The method\\'s theoretical grounding should explain *how* Symmetrical SyncMap\\'s core mechanics (symmetry, synchronization, mapping) inherently or explicitly handle this specific type of imbalance. Does it involve:\\n        *   Cost-sensitive learning/weighting?\\n        *   Specialized sampling (e.g., oversampling minority clusters, undersampling majority)?\\n        *   A loss function robust to class/cluster imbalance (e.g., focal loss, balanced loss)?\\n        *   A mechanism that prevents smaller clusters from being absorbed or ignored by larger ones during the optimization process?\\n    *   **Without a clear theoretical explanation of its imbalance-handling mechanism, any observed superior performance on imbalanced data might be coincidental or due to general algorithmic strength, rather than a targeted solution.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Analysis of Experimental Results on Imbalanced Datasets & Comparison with Existing Methods**\\n\\nAssuming a typical experimental setup, here\\'s what I\\'d look for and how I\\'d evaluate it:\\n\\n**Strengths (If Present):**\\n\\n1.  **Multiple Imbalanced Datasets:** A good study would use several diverse, real-world datasets known to exhibit cluster or class imbalance, ideally with varying imbalance ratios.\\n2.  **Clear Definition of Imbalance:** For each dataset, quantifying the imbalance (e.g., imbalance ratio, distribution of cluster sizes) is crucial.\\n3.  **Visualization of Clusters:** Visualizing the resulting clusters (if feasible for smaller graphs) could qualitatively demonstrate how well smaller clusters are preserved.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Concerns (Common Pitfalls & Why They Lead to Rejection):**\\n\\n1.  **Inadequate Baselines for Imbalance:**\\n    *   **Major Red Flag:** If the baselines only include general-purpose CGCP or clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Spectral Clustering, Louvain, Infomap, general graph neural networks for clustering), without *any* specific adaptation for imbalance. These methods are *known* to struggle with imbalance (e.g., K-means gravitating towards larger clusters). Showing a slight improvement over them on imbalanced data is not convincing proof of handling imbalance; it merely shows it\\'s a slightly better general algorithm.\\n    *   **Required Baselines:** The comparison *must* include state-of-the-art methods designed or adapted for imbalanced clustering/classification, such as:\\n        *   Clustering algorithms augmented with *oversampling* (e.g., SMOTE for features, if applicable) or *undersampling*.\\n        *   Cost-sensitive clustering algorithms (if they exist for CGCPs).\\n        *   Ensemble clustering methods that inherently handle diversity or imbalance (e.g., Bagging/Boosting variants applied to clustering).\\n        *   Self-training or semi-supervised approaches that might leverage small amounts of labeled data to guide clustering of minority groups.\\n2.  **Insufficient Evaluation Metrics for Imbalance:**\\n    *   **Major Red Flag:** Sole reliance on overall accuracy, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), or Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI). While useful, these metrics are often biased towards majority classes/clusters in imbalanced settings. A method can achieve high overall NMI by perfectly clustering large groups while completely failing on small ones.\\n    *   **Required Metrics:**\\n        *   **Balanced Accuracy:** Average recall per class/cluster.\\n        *   **Macro F1-score:** Averaging F1-scores for each class/cluster, giving equal weight to small and large ones.\\n        *   **Recall/Precision specifically for minority clusters/classes:** Explicitly show how well the smallest clusters are identified and how pure they are.\\n        *   **G-mean:** Geometric mean of recall for all classes/clusters, sensitive to poor performance on any single class.\\n        *   **Per-cluster performance breakdown:** Tables or graphs showing NMI/F1/P/R for *each* ground-truth cluster, highlighting performance on the smallest ones.\\n3.  **Lack of Varied Imbalance Ratios:** Experiments should ideally explore how performance changes as the degree of imbalance increases. A method might work for mild imbalance but fail dramatically under extreme imbalance.\\n4.  **No Statistical Significance Testing:** Without statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) across multiple runs and datasets, claiming superiority is anecdotal.\\n5.  **Ablation Studies for Imbalance-Handling Components:** If Symmetrical SyncMap has specific components theorized to address imbalance, an ablation study showing the impact of removing or modifying these components on imbalanced datasets would be highly convincing.\\n6.  **Parameter Tuning Fairness:** Ensure that all compared methods (especially baselines) are tuned fairly and optimally for each dataset. Suboptimal tuning of baselines can artificially inflate the proposed method\\'s performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Assessment: Do the Experiments Sufficiently Demonstrate the Algorithm\\'s Advantage in Imbalanced Scenarios?**\\n\\n**Likely Answer: NO, if the common pitfalls are present.**\\n\\nIf the paper primarily uses standard clustering metrics (NMI, ARI) and compares only against general-purpose clustering algorithms, it *does not* sufficiently demonstrate an advantage in imbalanced scenarios. Such experiments only show that Symmetrical SyncMap is a generally competent clustering algorithm, possibly slightly better, but not that it specifically *solves* the inherent challenges of imbalanced data.\\n\\nTo sufficiently demonstrate the advantage, the experiments *must* go beyond general performance metrics and baselines. They need to directly confront the problem of imbalance through specific metrics and by outperforming methods *designed* or *adapted* for imbalance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Specific Feedback on Experimental Design and Results (Recommendations for Improvement)**\\n\\n1.  **Clarify and Quantify \"Imbalance\":**\\n    *   Explicitly define what constitutes \"imbalance\" in the context of CGCPs.\\n    *   For each dataset, provide a detailed breakdown of cluster sizes, and ideally, an \"imbalance ratio\" metric (e.g., size of largest cluster / size of smallest cluster).\\n2.  **Strengthen Baselines:**\\n    *   **Crucial:** Include methods that explicitly address imbalance in clustering or classification tasks (e.g., density-based methods less sensitive to cluster size, methods incorporating over/undersampling strategies like SMOTE/ADASYN if applicable to feature vectors, cost-sensitive clustering algorithms, or ensemble approaches that can handle diverse cluster sizes).\\n    *   If no direct imbalance-aware CGCP methods exist, show how standard methods perform *after* applying imbalance-handling techniques (e.g., run a baseline method on an oversampled graph/features, if reasonable).\\n3.  **Adopt Imbalance-Sensitive Metrics:**\\n    *   Replace or heavily supplement overall NMI/ARI with **Balanced Accuracy, Macro F1-score, G-mean**, and detailed **recall/precision/F1 for minority clusters**.\\n    *   Present confusion matrices or per-cluster performance tables to vividly illustrate how well the smaller clusters are handled.\\n4.  **Vary Imbalance Ratios:**\\n    *   If possible, create or select datasets with a range of imbalance ratios to show the robustness of Symmetrical SyncMap as imbalance severity increases.\\n5.  **Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   Run all experiments multiple times (e.g., 30 runs) with different random seeds.\\n    *   Report mean and standard deviation.\\n    *   Perform non-parametric statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test or Friedman test with Nemenyi post-hoc test) to establish statistical significance of performance differences.\\n6.  **Ablation Study (if applicable):**\\n    *   If the method has specific components claimed to address imbalance, conduct an ablation study to show their individual contribution to performance on imbalanced datasets. This helps confirm the *reason* for observed improvements.\\n7.  **Qualitative Analysis:**\\n    *   For smaller graphs, visualize the clustering results, highlighting how well Symmetrical SyncMap preserves small, isolated, or difficult-to-find clusters compared to baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion and Recommendation**\\n\\nBased on the typical shortcomings in such papers, my recommendation would likely be:\\n\\n**REJECT (or Major Revision if the core idea is novel and promising but experimental validation is weak).**\\n\\n**Reasoning:** Without a clear theoretical basis for how Symmetrical SyncMap addresses imbalance, and without rigorous experimental validation using appropriate baselines and metrics specifically designed for imbalanced data, the claim of effectiveness in handling imbalanced CGCPs remains unsubstantiated. Merely showing better performance on some \"imbalanced datasets\" with general metrics and non-imbalance-aware baselines is insufficient to justify such a claim.

My assessment will focus on whether its proposed mechanisms genuinely embody self-organization and effectively address the ambitious claim of uncovering hierarchical topologies, alongside its biological relevance and practical utility.\\n\\n**Assessment of Self-Organizing Properties:**\\n\\nFor a system to be truly self-organizing, it should exhibit the following characteristics:\\n1.  **Local Interactions:** Global order emerges from purely local interactions between components, without centralized control.\\n2.  **Adaptation & Emergence:** The system adapts to its environment (input data) and develops a global structure or pattern that was not explicitly programmed but *emerges* from the local rules.\\n3.  **Robustness:** The emergent order is robust to perturbations or noise.\\n4.  **Dissipative Processes:** Often involves energy dissipation or information flow leading to a stable state or attractor.\\n\\nBased on the premise of a \"SyncMap,\" particularly \"Symmetrical\":\\n\\n*   **Strength in Local Interactions & Emergence:** The very core idea of nodes \"synchronizing\" implies local interactions. Each node (representing a data point or a position in the map) would likely adjust its state (e.g., phase, frequency, or position) based on its relationship (similarity, distance) to its neighbors in the data space and/or its projection in the map space. This distributed, local adjustment leading to a coherent global \"map\" is a strong indicator of self-organization. The \"symmetrical\" aspect likely reinforces the bidirectional influence, leading to more stable and consistent map formation, a common property in self-organizing neural networks (e.g., Kohonen maps, where competition and cooperation between neurons define the map).\\n*   **Adaptive Dynamics:** The map \"learns\" or \"adapts\" to the underlying manifold of the input data. As synchronization processes converge, the map units (or neurons) should settle into positions that reflect the topology and density of the input data, thus achieving a form of data-driven adaptation.\\n*   **Implicit Objective Function:** Self-organizing maps often implicitly minimize a global energy function (e.g., distortion error in SOMs, or embedding stress). For SyncMap, this might be related to minimizing \"phase discord\" or maximizing \"synchronization coherence\" across the map, which would drive the units to topologically meaningful positions.\\n\\n**However, the depth of self-organization depends heavily on the specific update rules.** If the updates are purely iterative gradient descents on a predefined global objective, while adaptive, it\\'s less \"emergent\" than systems where the rules themselves are simpler and the global behavior more surprising. A truly self-organizing SyncMap would have very simple, biologically plausible local rules that lead to complex map formation without explicitly calculating a global error.\\n\\n**Ability to Uncover Complex Hierarchical Topologies:**\\n\\nThis is the most ambitious claim and requires significant scrutiny. Most manifold learning techniques (t-SNE, UMAP, LLE, traditional SOMs) excel at preserving local neighborhood structures and projecting data onto a *flat* manifold, or discovering *clusters*. Uncovering *hierarchy* is a different beast.\\n\\n*   **How could SyncMap achieve this?**\\n    *   **Multi-scale Synchronization:** One potential mechanism is if the synchronization process itself operates at multiple scales or resolutions. For instance, coarse-grained synchronization could identify top-level clusters, while finer-grained synchronization within those clusters could reveal sub-hierarchies. This would require specific algorithmic design for multi-resolution dynamics or a nested application of the SyncMap principle.\\n    *   **Emergent Hierarchical Clustering:** The SyncMap might naturally arrange points such that clusters and sub-clusters become apparent in the low-dimensional map. However, this is often an *interpretation* of the resulting map rather than an *explicit construction* of a hierarchy by the algorithm itself. To truly \"uncover\" hierarchy, the algorithm should output not just a projection, but also a tree structure or nested relationships.\\n    *   **Challenges:** If SyncMap merely projects data onto a 2D or 3D manifold, the hierarchy would need to be *inferred* from the proximity and density of points, possibly requiring an additional clustering or hierarchical clustering algorithm post-hoc. A strong claim about \"uncovering\" hierarchy implies the algorithm *itself* yields this hierarchical structure directly. This would be a significant differentiator from many existing manifold learning techniques. The paper must clearly demonstrate how hierarchical levels or relationships are explicitly represented or extracted during the synchronization process, not just as a visual byproduct.\\n\\n**Biological Plausibility:**\\n\\n*   **Strong Foundation:** The concept of synchronization is highly biologically plausible. Neural systems exhibit widespread oscillatory dynamics and synchronize activity across various scales (from local field potentials to brain-wide networks).\\n    *   **Neural Oscillations:** Synchronization of neural oscillations (e.g., gamma, theta rhythms) is implicated in binding, attention, memory, and information processing. A SyncMap could be seen as a computational model where data points are \"neurons\" and their relationships are \"synaptic connections,\" with synchronized states representing coherent perceptual or cognitive states.\\n    *   **Hebbian-like Learning:** The local adjustment rules could mimic Hebbian plasticity (\"neurons that fire together, wire together\") or other forms of synaptic plasticity, where the strength of connections or the similarity of states is reinforced through co-activity.\\n    *   **Self-Organizing Maps in Biology:** The brain\\'s somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices develop self-organizing topographic maps based on sensory input, exhibiting similar principles of local competitive and cooperative learning.\\n*   **Potential Weaknesses:** While the general inspiration is strong, the specific details matter. Is it too simplistic? Does it account for sparse coding, inhibitory mechanisms, or energy efficiency often found in biological neural networks? Does it model *how* the brain maps information, or just borrow the *idea* of synchronization for a different purpose? For true biological plausibility, the model should ideally offer testable predictions or insights into neural computation. If it\\'s merely *inspired* by biology without contributing to our understanding of it, the \"biological plausibility\" argument becomes weaker from a scientific standpoint.\\n\\n**Potential for Real-World Applications:**\\n\\nGiven its potential properties, Symmetrical SyncMap could be highly valuable for:\\n\\n*   **Data Visualization & Exploration:** For complex, high-dimensional datasets, it could create intuitive 2D/3D maps that preserve inherent data structure, making hidden patterns, clusters, and outliers easily discernible. This is especially useful in fields like bioinformatics, social network analysis, and sensor data processing.\\n*   **Unsupervised Learning & Clustering:** If it effectively forms coherent maps, it could serve as a robust clustering algorithm, where clusters correspond to regions of high synchronization or density in the map. Its potential for hierarchical topology discovery would be a significant advantage here.\\n*   **Novelty/Anomaly Detection:** Outliers or anomalous data points would likely fail to synchronize strongly with the main body of the map, or map to isolated regions, making them easy to detect.\\n*   **Manifold Learning:** As a competitor to t-SNE, UMAP, and LLE, it could offer a novel approach to learning the intrinsic manifold of complex data, potentially with better preservation of global structure due to the \"symmetrical\" and synchronization-driven nature.\\n*   **Biological Data Analysis:** Given its biological inspiration, it could be particularly suited for analyzing complex biological datasets (e.g., gene expression, neural recordings, protein interaction networks) where underlying hierarchical and topological structures are often hypothesized.\\n\\n**Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:**\\n\\n1.  **Explicit Hierarchy Mechanism:** The primary weakness is the strong claim of uncovering \"complex hierarchical topologies.\" This needs to be rigorously demonstrated. Does the algorithm *construct* a hierarchy, or merely produce a map from which one can be *inferred*? If it\\'s the latter, the claim should be tempered. If it\\'s the former, the specific algorithmic steps for hierarchy extraction are crucial.\\n2.  **Scalability:** Synchronization algorithms can be computationally intensive, especially for very large datasets ($N$ data points) and high dimensionality ($D$ features). The paper needs to demonstrate its scalability against state-of-the-art methods.\\n3.  **Parameter Sensitivity:** How many hyperparameters does it have, and how sensitive is the map formation to them? Self-organizing systems ideally require minimal tuning.\\n4.  **Theoretical Guarantees:** Are there theoretical guarantees on convergence, stability, and the fidelity of the topological preservation?\\n5.  **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** A strong evaluation requires benchmarking against well-established manifold learning, clustering, and hierarchical clustering algorithms to demonstrate superior or complementary performance.\\n\\n**Conclusion/Recommendation:**\\n\\nThe Symmetrical SyncMap presents a compelling conceptual framework rooted in biologically plausible self-organizing principles. The idea of leveraging synchronization for manifold learning is intrinsically appealing and holds promise for robust data mapping and visualization, exhibiting strong self-organizing properties in its local interactions and emergent global structure.\\n\\nHowever, the audacious claim of explicitly \"uncovering complex hierarchical topologies\" requires substantial and concrete evidence. If the algorithm merely produces a low-dimensional embedding where hierarchical *interpretation* is possible, it is not a direct \"uncovering\" mechanism. The biological inspiration is strong in its conceptual appeal, but its utility as a scientific model of brain function needs to be clearly differentiated from its use as an engineering solution *inspired* by biology.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** I would **not reject** the paper outright based on the description, as the core concept of a synchronization-based self-organizing map is highly valuable and biologically inspired. However, I would strongly recommend **major revisions**. The paper must:\\n\\n*   **Rigorously detail and demonstrate the specific mechanism by which it *uncovers* hierarchical topologies.** This is paramount. Does it build a tree? Does it output multi-resolution maps? If it just creates a flat map, this claim needs to be significantly toned down.\\n*   **Provide a more in-depth analysis of its self-organizing dynamics beyond just stating it uses synchronization.** How do local rules lead to global convergence? What are the dynamics of this process?\\n*   **Clearly articulate its contribution compared to existing manifold learning and hierarchical clustering techniques.**\\n*   **Address scalability and hyperparameter sensitivity with empirical results.**\\n\\nWithout a clear and demonstrable mechanism for hierarchical discovery, the SyncMap would primarily be evaluated as another manifold learning technique, albeit one with an interesting self-organizing foundation.
