The paper title is: Exploring The Role of Mean Teachers in Self-supervised Masked Auto-Encoders\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is the de facto standard architecture in natural language processing (NLP), and has also surpassed state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (He et al., 2016; Tan & Le, 2019) (CNN) feature extractors in vision tasks through models such as the Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) (ViT). Prior to the advent of ViTs, self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms in the vision community (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020c; Grill et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021) utilized CNNs (e.g., ResNet (He et al., 2016)) as a backbone, performing instance discrimination pretext tasks through contrastive learning (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020c). Interestingly, self-distillation schemes (Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021) using a teacher consisting of an exponential moving average (EMA) of the previous students, (i.e., a \u201cmean\u201d teacher) (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), have been shown to exhibit strong performance. Inspired by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training in NLP, recent SSL approaches (Bao et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) in the vision community have proposed forms of masked image modeling (MIM) pretext tasks, using ViT-based backbones. MIM is a simple pretext task which first randomly masks patches of an image, and then predicts the contents of the masked patches (i.e., tokens) using various reconstruction targets, e.g., visual tokens (Bao et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2021), semantic features (Zhou et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) and raw pixels (He et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). In particular, iBOT (Zhou et al., 2022) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022) use a self-distillation scheme for MIM by having the teacher network provide an encoded target (i.e., feature representation) to match the encoded features from the original image at a semantic feature level. Methods using semantic-level target representations exhibit strong performance on image-level classification tasks. On the contrary, SimMIM (Xie et al., 2022) and MAE (He et al., 2022) provide pixel-level reconstructions of masked patches, and lead to superior performance on dense prediction tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, self-distillation for pixel-level MIM has been under-explored as of yet. A recent SSL approach, BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), has shown that a slight architectural asymmetry between a student and EMA teacher can create a stable model which outperforms previous contrastive learning methods. The success of BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) inspired empirical (Chen & He, 2021) and theoretical (Tian et al., 2021) analyses into what enables BYOL to effectively learn and avoid collapse with the EMA Teacher during pre-training. Still, despite the popularity of the EMA Teacher in SSL, relatively little is known about how the teacher interacts with the student throughout the training process. In this work, we explore the dynamics of self-distillation in pixel-level MIM, e.g., MAE. Through analyzing a simple linear model, we investigate the dynamics between the gradients of an image reconstruction loss and a teacher consistency loss, learning that the gradients provided by the teacher conditionally adjust the current gradient by a weighted mixture of previous gradients based on the similarity between the current and previous features, acting as a conditional momentum regularizer. For example, Fig. 1(a) shows the case where the inputs which created the previous gradient momentum are similar to the ones which created the current gradients. In this case, the teacher makes a conditional correction to remove the previous direction from the momentum, allowing the student to learn from the newer knowledge. If however, the inputs which created both gradients are nearly orthogonal, the teacher would instead respond with minimal to no correction. We derive this conditional gradient effect in Proposition 4.1, and show evidence in both a simple linear model (Fig. 2) as well as in a deep ViT-based (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) MAE model (Fig. 3). To empirically validate our analysis of the contributions of EMA Teachers, we present a simple yet effective SSL approach, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE), by equipping MAE with an EMA Teacher, and providing a consistency target. Additionally, we study the effects of using different image masking strategies between the student and teacher models on the consistency objective, finding that using the same mask generally leads to better performance in both pre-training and downstream tasks. The same mask tends to form an orthogonal objective (Fig. 4(b)) to the reconstruction loss, which has been shown (Suteu & Guo, 2019; Ajemian et al., 2013) to be beneficial for multi-task models as there is limited interference between tasks. This observation may be of interest to any future SSL works which leverage multiple pre-training objectives. Our experiments follow the same architecture, settings, and pre-training recipe as MAE (He et al., 2022), and we find that the simple addition of a teacher (RC-MAE) consistently outperforms MAE in all model sizes (e.g., ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L) when fine-tuned for ImageNet classification. Additionally, we find that the teacher\u2019s conditional gradient correction we identified allows RC-MAE to converge faster compared to MAE (Fig. 1(b)), and RC-MAE outperforms recent self-distillation methods, MSN and iBOT, on dense prediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. Furthermore, compared to recent self-distillation methods utilizing a mean teacher, RC-MAE realizes more efficiency in computation and memory due to the fact that both networks receive only a subset of patches instead of the whole image. Our main contributions are as follows: 1. We analyze the contribution of EMA Teachers in self-supervised learning, finding that the gradient provided by the teachers conditionally adjusts current gradient direction and magnitude conditioned on the similarity of current and previous features. 2. Using this knowledge, we propose a simple, yet effective approach for self-supervised pre-training of Vision Transformers, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked AutoEncoder (RC-MAE), which improves over vanilla MAE in terms of speed of convergence, adversarial robustness, and performance on classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. 3. Thanks to its simplicity, RC-MAE achieves greater savings in both memory and computation compared to other state-of-the-art self-distillation-based MIM methods. 2 RELATED WORKS: In NLP, masked language modeling (MLM) is common for large-scale pre-training (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2018) by predicting masked words. Similarly, ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022) based masked image modeling (MIM) approaches (Zhou et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) for computer vision tasks have been proposed. These MIM approaches first apply a mask to patches of an image, and then the masked patches are predicted given the visible patches either at the token-level (Zhou et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) or pixel-level (Chen et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 2022; He et al., 2022). Token-level masked patch prediction (Zhou et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022) predicts tokens or clusters of masked patches similar to MLM. Pixel-level prediction (Chen et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 2022; He et al., 2022) learns visual representations by reconstructing masked input patches at the RGB pixel-level. Additionally, self-distillation (Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021) has been deployed in MIM methods by utilizing a teacher constructed from an exponential moving average (EMA-Teacher) of student weights, providing an additional target for the student. iBOT (Zhou et al., 2022) gives a full view of an image (i.e., all patches) to the teacher network as an online tokenizer, offering a token-level target of the masked patches. Giving a masked view to the student and a full view to the teacher, MSN (Assran et al., 2022) makes the output embeddings from an EMATeacher serve as a semantic feature representation target to the student. Likewise, BootMAE (Dong et al., 2022) also adopts an EMA-Teacher, providing a feature-level target to the student on top of the pixel-level MIM approach. A key difference from these self-distillation MIM approaches is that RC-MAE provides only unmasked patches to the teacher and student, instead of the full image. As a result, RC-MAE shows better scalability compared with recent methods (see. Table 6). 3 PRELIMINARIES: The Masked Autoencoder. (MAE) (He et al., 2022) is a self-supervised approach with a ViT encoder f and decoder h, which randomly masks a portion of input patches, and then reconstructs the masked patches given the visible patches. Given an image X \u2208 RC\u00d7H\u00d7W , MAE patchifies X into N non-overlapping patches X\u0303 \u2208 RN\u00d7(P 2\u22c5C) with a patch size of P and randomly masks a subset of patches M (i.e., mask tokens). The subset of visible patches V is input to the encoder to achieve latent representations: z = f(V). Then, the decoder h attempts to reconstructM given the latent representations, Y\u0302 = h(z;M), where Y\u0302 \u2208 RN\u00d7(P 2\u22c5C) denotes the reconstructed patches. MAE utilizes the mean-squared error reconstruction loss Lr which is only computed on masked patches: Lr = 1 \u2223M\u2223 \u2211 i\u2208M \u2225X\u0303i \u2212 Y\u0302i\u2225 2 2 (1) The EMA Teacher. The mean teacher model (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) is a temporal ensemble of previous student weights which provides an additional target to the student. Doing so has been shown to reduce the number of labels needed to achieve the same level of accuracy, and has become a core part of recent state-of-the-art SSL approaches as reviewed in Section 2. Predictions from the student and teacher are compared via a function such as mean squared error (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) or cross-entropy (Caron et al., 2021). Generally, the teacher T is updated after every gradient step on the student S, using an exponential moving average of the student weights, T (t) = \u03b1T (t\u22121) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)S(t) = t \u2211 i=0 \u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)S(t\u2212i), (2) with a parameter \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1). The additional target forms a consistency loss Lc between the teacher and the student predictions. Considering the mean squared error loss, and Y\u0302 \u2032 being the prediction from the teacher model, Lc = 1 \u2223M\u2223 \u2211 i\u2208M \u2225Y\u0302i \u2212 Y\u0302 \u2032 i \u2225 2 2 (3) 4 THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER: Although EMA teachers are common in recent SSL approaches, relatively little is known about the interaction between the student and teacher. Through analysis of a linear model that mirrors a MAE+Teacher objective, we will show how the gradients of both models interact. Considering a linear model for the student S and teacher T consisting of a single weight matrix, like an MAE, the objective is to reconstruct the original input x from a masked input x\u0303 = x \u2299m, where \u2299 is an elementwise multiplication and m is a random binary mask with a predefined masking ratio. Proposition 4.1. With the reconstruction and consistency objective (Eqs. (1) and (3)), the gradient contribution of the teacher (\u2207SLc) adjusts the direction and magnitude of the reconstruction gradients (\u2207SLr). The magnitude and direction of the adjustment from the teacher are conditional based on the similarity between the current and previous features.

Please see Appendices B and B.1.1 The gradient of the consistency loss \u2207SLc is wholly represented by the last term on the RHS. Interestingly, there is a dot product x\u0302\u22bax\u0303 which gets distributed into every term of the sum. If we consider the dot product as cosine similarity cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = x\u0302\u22bax\u0303/\u2225x\u0302\u2225\u2225x\u0303\u2225, the possible cases for cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) for x\u0302 at a single arbitrary timestep t are as follows cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) \u2208 {\u22121,0,1, (0,1), (\u22121,0)}. Case 1: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) \u2208 {\u22121,1}. In this case, the resulting gradient from the last term on the RHS of Eq. (4) removes some amount of residual memory of the direction of a previous gradient. A cosine similarity of \u22231\u2223 also means the inputs are collinear, and the gradient is invariant to the sign of x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. Case 2: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = 0. In this case, There is zero contribution from the teacher for this term in the sum. Case 3: \u2223cos(x\u0302, x\u0303)\u2223 \u2208 (0,1). In this case, the component which contains the previous gradient will be weighted by the coefficient x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. In all cases, due to the sign of the last term on the RHS of Eq. (4), the gradient of consistency loss conditionally removes residual memory of previous gradients. The magnitude of the removal is likewise conditional, which can be seen by using the triangle inequality to upper bound the final term of Proposition 4.1 to see that, \u2225\u2207SLc\u2225 = \u2225 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i)x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 \u2264 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2225\u2207S(t\u2212i)[. . . x\u0302 \u22ba ]x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 (5) leading to the conclusion that the magnitude and direction of the consistency gradient directly results from the similarities to features in the recent learning history, as \u03b1i \u2208 (0,1) decays exponentially for distant timesteps in the past. The gradient of the student model can be bounded in a similar fashion, but without the decaying \u03b1 coefficients which makes the bound much looser in general (see Appendix B.1). Empirical Test. To test for this effect in a linear model, we conducted an experiment by training a linear model on data consisting of random samples x \u2208 R32 from random multivariate normal distributions (see Appendix E.1 for further details). After each training iteration, we sampled an extra batch of data, and for each single point in the batch we constructed sequences consisting of two inputs described in Table 1. We then took a single gradient step and teacher update for the first input and calculated the gradient of the reconstruction and consistency loss on the second input. Expected Outcome. Based on the similarity of the inputs, we would expect the consistency loss to produce a larger gradient for the same or similar inputs and a smaller gradient for different inputs. Additionally, the direction of the reconstruction and consistency gradient should be closer to opposite for case 1, and closer to orthogonal for case 3, with case 2 falling somewhere in-between. In Fig. 2, we in fact observe this trend, noticing that the reconstruction loss produces a significantly larger gradient when the second gradient step is on different inputs due to the looser bound in Eq. (9). Interpretation. This finding implies that the teacher plays a role of something akin to a gradient memory, where the teacher acts as a memory bank which retrieves the memory of recent gradients based on matching a query x\u0303 to a key x\u0302 in the memory bank. For novel inputs which do not match anything in recent memory, the teacher responds with a minimal correction, letting the student learn more from the reconstruction signal. If the query and key match, however, the teachers gradient will conditionally remove some directional information contained in the previous gradient. This allows the student to move in a direction which favors new knowledge gained from the current input, and cancels out some previous momentum. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). In Appendix D, we show that the same terms appear in the context of a deep model, with the dot product appearing at each semantic feature level. However, in a complex model with nonlinearities, the resulting gradient direction becomes harder to interpret. Even so, in Fig. 3, we empirically find the same underlying trend in the gradient norms and directions when analyzing RC-MAE (a ViT based model). 5 RECONSTRUCTION-CONSISTENT MASKED AUTO-ENCODER: In this section, we utilize the analysis from Section 4, and present a simple self-supervised approach, Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE). The overview of RC-MAE is illustrated in Fig. 1(c). RC-MAE is a ViT-based version of the simple linear model outlined in Section 4 where the total objective consists of a reconstruction and consistency loss from the original image and a mean teacher, respectively. The teacher network shares the same architecture as the student, consisting of an encoder f\u03b8t (e.g., ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021)) and a decoder h\u03b8t . At timestep t, the model parameters of the teacher \u03b8t are updated to be the exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model parameters \u03b8s (Eq. (2)). While BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and MSN (Assran et al., 2022) make the student network mimic the teachers semantic-level representation, for RC-MAE, the consistency and reconstruction targets are both pixel-level representations. We would expect that the two pixel-level objectives would lead to better performance on dense prediction tasks. Additionally, we would expect the conditional momentum corrections from the consistency gradient to allow a stable, faster rate of convergence, due to our interpretation in Section 4 of the momentum corrections supplied by the teacher. To investigate masking strategies for the teacher, we define two types of RC-MAE, RC-MAE-S and RC-MAE-D. RC-MAE-S uses the same mask tokens for both student and teacher networks. Conversely, RC-MAE-D, uses different mask tokens for each network. For both variants, given an image, we randomly sample respective mask tokensM with a mask ratio (e.g., 75% like MAE). The visible patches are then given to the student and teacher networks, which reconstruct all patches. With the consistency loss Eq. (3), the RC-MAE objective is: 1 \u2223M\u2223 \u2211 i\u2208M (\u2223\u2223X\u0303i \u2212 Y\u0302i\u2223\u2223 2 \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 reconstruction +\u2223\u2223Y\u0302i \u2212 Y\u0302 \u2032 i \u2223\u2223 2 \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 consistency ), (6) where i is the token index and Y\u0302 , Y\u0302 \u2032 denote the reconstructed patches from the decoders of the student and teacher networks, respectively. For the reconstruction target, we use standard normalized patch pixels as done with MAE (He et al., 2022). For RC-MAE-D the student and teacher process different visible patches, and the total loss is only calculated on the student\u2019s mask token locations Ms. Unless otherwise specified, RC-MAE means RC-MAE-S in the rest of this paper. 6 EXPERIMENTS: To validate the effectiveness of the EMA Teacher in RC-MAE, we compare RC-MAE to an otherwise identical MAE (He et al., 2022) baseline. We use ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) as an encoder and transformer decoder with the same depth and dimension as MAE. For a fair comparison with MAE, we follow the same implementation as MAE\u2019s official code. For experiments, we pre-train on ImageNet-1K and evaluate linear probing (LN) and end-to-end fine-tuning (FT) for classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation for which we use the Mask R-CNN benchmark (Li et al., 2021) for dense prediction. Further details regarding implementation and training settings can be found in Appendix E. Table 2: Different mask types for the teacher network in RC-MAE. The \u2018Same\u2019 means that the teacher network uses the same mask tokens as the student and \u2018Diff.\u2019 is the opposite.

To investigate the effect of masking strategies between teacher and student, we evaluate RC-MAE variants against a plain MAE. Results are shown in Table 2. Both RC-MAE-S and RC-MAE-D outperform MAE, achieving a higher accuracy gap in linear probing (1.4% / 1.1%) compared to fine-tuning (0.2%). Notably, RC-MAE-S shows higher performance than RC-MAE-D on object detection and instance segmentation while the performance gap for classification slightly favors RC-MAE-D. To analyze the differences between RC-MAED and RC-MAE-S, we recorded the cosine similarity between the reconstruction and consistency gradients throughout training Fig. 4(b). We found that RC-MAE-D resulted in a cosine similarity with a positive bias, while RC-MAE-S appears to be centered near zero. We hypothesize that a conflict between the pixel-level reconstruction and consistency objectives causes the biased cosine similarity in RC-MAE-D, leading to lower pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning performance on these tasks. The base conflict likely stems from the fact that MAE models tend to give lower-quality reconstructions on visible patches. Therefore, when a patch is masked in the student but not the teacher, the teacher provides a low-quality target, interfering with the high-quality original input target. Masking ratio & Training epoch. We compare to MAE using different masking ratios, measuring pre-training time on the same 8-GPU machine. Per-iteration, RC-MAE is slower due to the added teacher network. However, compared to MAE with 75% mask & 1600 epochs (default), RC-MAE with 80% mask & 800 epochs achieves the same level of performance while using 55% less time. Fig. 1(b) illustrates fine-tuning accuracy curves of RC-MAE (75% mask & 800 epochs) and MAE (75% mask & 1600 epochs). It is easy to observe that RC-MAE reaches higher accuracy quicker than MAE. As the teacher is the only difference between the models, the increased rate of convergence is a direct result from the conditional teacher gradients.

Note that our reproduced MAE (e.g., ViT-B and ViTL) on the same 8 GPUs machine shows slightly lower accuracy than the original MAE due to a known reproduction issue. We assume that the slight difference in accuracy stems from the different GPU environments. For all ViT backbone sizes, RC-MAE consistently outperforms the reproduced MAE. While ViT-S and ViT-B achieve lower accuracy than iBOT or BootMAE, RC-MAE with ViTL surpasses the state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest that the reconstruction-consistent scheme could have stronger benefits for large-scale models. 6.3 OBJECT DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION ON COCO: To validate the pixel-level representation quality of RC-MAE, we analyze performance on object detection and instance segmentation on COCO (Lin et al., 2014). Following the same training protocol (Li et al., 2021) and implementation details as MAE (He et al., 2022), we fine-tune Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) with a ViT-Base backbone pre-trained by RC-MAE for 100 epochs. The training details are described in Appendix E.3. Table 5 summarizes the detection and segmentation results. RC-MAE improves over the MAE baseline by 0.7% box AP and 0.5% mask AP. We note that both RC-MAE and MAE outperform iBOT by large margins, even though iBOT shows higher ImageNet classification accuracy. These results suggest that the pure pixel-level objectives allow models to learn richer representations at the region or pixel-level. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 5, while iBOT and MSN attend to uncorrelated regions given the query patches, RC-MAE and MAE can focus more sharply on the pertinent regions near the query patches. These results indicate that pixel-level MIM is more advantageous than semantic-level MIM for dense prediction tasks. 6.4 RESOURCE COMPARISON: MEMORY AND COMPUTATION TIME: In terms of memory consumption and computation cost, we conduct a resource comparison with the self-distillation-based MIM methods, e.g., MSN, iBOT, and BootMAE as shown in Table 6. More details about how to measure are described in Appendix F.2. Since adding the EMA Teacher to MAE, RC-MAE shows more memory usage and runtime. However, compared with state-of-the-art self-distillation methods, RC-MAE requires less memory usage and computation cost. This result can be attributed to the fact that other methods feed the full image to the teacher network, whereas RC-MAE only delivers visible patches (no mask patches) to the teacher same as the student. 6.5 ROBUSTNESS EVALUATION ON IMAGENET: We evaluate the robustness of models on four ImageNet variants: ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019),-A (Hendrycks et al., 2021b),-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), and -Sketch (Wang et al., 2019), which are common benchmarks for evaluating robustness to perturbations. Table 7 shows the robustness comparison with MAE using the ViT-B backbone. RC-MAE outperforms MAE consistently on all robustness datasets, indicating that the conditional gradient corrections from the teacher result in a more robust solution. 7 CONCLUSION: In this work, we have provided an analysis along with empirical verifications of the nature of contributions from EMA teachers in self-supervised learning. We have found that teachers provide a momentum correction, conditionally removing previous gradient directions with magnitudes which are conditioned on current and previous feature similarities. Equipped with our analysis, we proposed a simple and effective self-supervised learning approach, RC-MAE, combining a masked autoencoder (MAE) with an EMA teacher. In experiments, we observed that the teacher enables MAE to converge faster and achieve a gain in ImageNet classification with increased robustness. Furthermore, RC-MAE outperforms recent self-supervised models on dense tasks. Since our aim is to analyze the dynamics of the EMA teacher, we design a simple approach to validate our findings, which results in better efficiency of both computation and memory compared to other self-distillation methods. For future works, we look forward to seeing further uses our analysis may lead to. For example, could the conditional corrections from the teacher be adequately incorporated into an Adam-like optimizer? If so this would remove the need to have a full model copy as a teacher and lead to cost savings and faster convergence in a wide variety of settings outside of self-supervised learning. 8 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT: In this section, we guide where the sections are for reproducibility. \u2022 Linear model experiments outlined in Section 4 \u2192 Appendix E.1 \u2022 ImageNet experiments such as pre-training, fine-tuning, linear probing, and robustness evaluation \u2192 Appendix E.2 \u2022 COCO object detection and instance segmentation \u2192 Appendix E.3 A APPENDIX: We will briefly describe the contents of each section of this appendix below: \u2022 Appendix B: Detailed Derivations of Proposition 4.1 the Main Text. \u2022 Appendix C: An Intuitive Explanation of Differences Between RC-MAE-D and RC-MAES. \u2022 Appendix D Does the Linear Model Extend to Deep Models? \u2022 Appendix E: Extra Experimental Details. \u2022 Appendix F: Additional Experiments Not Covered in the Main Text.

In essence, the MAE objective learns the transformation from square diagonal blocks to off-diagonal blocks of a feature covariance matrix. Setting the gradient of the reconstruction loss (which is the plain MAE objective) equal to zero, re-arranging and taking the expectation w.r.t the joint data and masking distribution p(x, x\u0303) we can see, 0 = Sx\u0303x\u0303\u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba xx\u0303\u22ba = Sx\u0303x\u0303\u22ba Ep(x,x\u0303)[xx\u0303\u22ba] = Ep(x,x\u0303)[Sx\u0303x\u0303\u22ba] Ep(x,x\u0303)[xx\u0303\u22ba] = S\u222c x,x\u0303 p(x, x\u0303)x\u0303x\u0303\u22badxdx\u0303 Ep(x,x\u0303)[xx\u0303\u22ba] = SEp(x\u0303)[x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba] \u03a3x,x\u0303 = S\u03a3x\u0303,x\u0303 This means that the optimal S represents the transformation which takes the square positive semidefinite covariance matrix \u03a3x\u0303,x\u0303 and transforms it into another off diagonal block of the covariance matrix \u03a3x,x\u0303, which is a part of some larger block covariance matrix, [ \u03a3x,x \u03a3x,x\u0303 \u03a3x\u0303,x \u03a3x\u0303,x\u0303 ] B.1 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER? Although the student-teacher paradigm with an EMA teacher is common Tarvainen & Valpola (2017); Grill et al. (2020); Assran et al. (2022); Zhou et al. (2022); Caron et al. (2021); Bao et al. (2022), it is still not well understood how the teacher objective directly interacts with and helps the student. In addition to the explanations in Section 4, here we will provide a complete derivation of Proposition 4.1. B.1.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4.1 The gradient contribution from the teacher and the consistency loss conditionally remove previous gradient directions based on similarities of current and previous features.

For this case, a cosine similarity of \u22231\u2223means the points are collinear, existing in the same line, which makes the gradient invariant to the sign of x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. The removal of the previous gradient direction will have the largest impact in this case. Case 2: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = 0. For this case, x\u0302\u22bax\u0303 = 0, which zeros out the whole term. There is no removal of the previous gradient direction for this term in the recursion. Case 3: \u2223cos(x\u0302, x\u0303)\u2223 \u2208 (0,1). In this case, the component which contains the previous gradient will be weighted by the coefficient \u03b6 = x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. \u2207SLr +\u2207SLc = Sx\u0303x\u0303 \u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba \u2212 \u23a1 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a3 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03b6i\u03bb[Sx\u0302 \u2212 x + (S \u2212 T )x\u0302] (t\u2212i)\u23a4\u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a6 x\u0303\u22ba The generic linear model which has a gradient in the form of \u2202L \u2202\u0398 = (\u0398x\u0303\u2212x)x\u0303\u22ba, can be interpreted as a gradient direction and magnitude for every component in the vector (\u0398x\u0303 \u2212 x) with a further conditional direction and magnitude projected to the components of \u0398 by the final x\u0303\u22ba term. Therefore, in each case above, the weight given to the gradient of each element of S is weighted conditionally based on dot product x\u0302\u22bax\u0303, and the final projection of the current feature x\u0303\u22ba. Remark B.2. 1 The upper bound on the gradient of the consistency loss can be bounded with the triangle inequality. We can examine the following term which uses the previous result from Eq. (8), \u2207SLc = \u2212[ t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) ]x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba distributing the the outer terms and using the triangle inequality, we can see that, \u2225\u2207SLc\u2225 = \u2225[ t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i)]x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 \u2264 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2225\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i)x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 The most significant (judged by \u03b1 coefficients) term in the upper bound of the norm of the consistency loss is when i = 1. Therefore the norm of the consistency loss from the teacher is likely to decrease if the current input is not similar to the previous input. Likewise, the most significant term in the upper bound increases when the current input has a high similarity to the input x\u0302(t\u22121). One should also note that the upper bound of the reconstruction loss can be decomposed via a similar line of reasoning, G(Lr) = Sx\u0303x\u0303 \u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba = (S(t\u22121) \u2212 \u03bb\u2207S(t\u22121)L (t\u22121) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba = (S(0) \u2212 \u03bb t \u2211 i=1 \u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba Focusing only on the non constant terms, we can see that, \u2225 t \u2211 i=1 (\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 \u2264 t \u2211 i=1 \u03bb\u2225\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 (9) It is easy to see there are no exponentially decreasing coefficients on the terms for the previous time steps, making the upper bound for the reconstruction loss larger than that of the consistency loss. This should lead to the reconstruction loss having a larger gradient contribution for novel inputs when compared to the consistency loss, as empirically shown in Figs. 2 and 3. C WHY DOES RC-MAE-S OUTPERFORM RC-MAE-D: RC-MAE-S uses the same mask between the teacher and the student, while RC-MAE-D uses a different mask between the teacher and the student. Empirically, we observed a difference in cosine similarity between the gradients of Lr and Lc for the different masking strategies in the consistency loss as depicted in (Fig. 4). In general, a different masking strategy x\u0303 and x\u0302 forces Sx\u0303 towards the prediction of T x\u0302 but there is no reason to expect that this objective aligns well with the original reconstruction target in practice. For example, MAE models are known to give poor reconstructions on masked patches, because the masked patches do not receive any gradient signal during the pre-training phase. Therefore, on patches which are unmasked in the student and masked in the teacher, RC-MAE-D provides a consistency objective which interferes with the reconstruction objective by giving a noisy target of lower quality, which is the likely cause which leads to worse pre-training performance as shown in Fig. 4 and also lower finetuning performance as shown in Table 2. D DO THE FINDINGS FROM THE LINEAR MODEL EXTEND TO DEEP MODELS?: Although we have analyzed a simple linear model, a more complex deep model with non-linearities can be broken down in a similar way. To see this with a simple network consisting of a single hidden layer B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) with an elementwise non-linearity \u03c3, and a quadratic consistency loss Lc = 1 2 \u2225B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2212D\u03c3(Cx\u0303)\u222522, where the teacher weights are {C,D}, the teacher at a single layer can be expanded according to, D\u03c3(Cx\u0303) =D\u03c3([(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A + \u03b1C(t\u22121)]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A(t\u2212i)]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A + t \u2211 i=1 [\u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(A + \u03bb t\u22121 \u2211 j=t\u2212i \u2207A(i)L (j))]]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 [\u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(\u03bb t\u22121 \u2211 j=t\u2212i \u2207A(j)L (j))]]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207At\u2212iL (t\u2212i)]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb[. . . x\u0302\u22ba](t\u2212i)]x\u0303) where the fourth step is a result of rearranging the sums following the same steps as Eq. (8). The term [. . . x\u0302\u22ba] results from the fact that we know the previous gradient ends with the term x\u0302\u22ba, where x\u0302 is another i.i.d. sample from a previous batch, due to the chain rule applied as follows, \u2202L \u2202A = \u2202L dB\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202Ax\u0303 \u2202Ax\u0303 \u2202A = [(B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2212D\u03c3(Cx\u0303))\u22baB diag(\u03c3\u2032(Ax\u0303))] \u22ba x\u0303\u22ba = [(B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2212D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb[. . . x\u0302\u22ba](t\u2212i)]x\u0303)) \u22ba B diag(\u03c3\u2032(Ax\u0303))] \u22ba x\u0303\u22ba This shows that although intermediate representations are more complicated, they contain similar terms, and the dot product term is present at every intermediate representation. Having this term in each semantic feature space is useful, as the dot product in the high dimensional pixel space may carry less meaning. Empirically, we observed the same overall effects in the deep ViT based RC-MAE Fig. 3 as we did in the simple linear model Fig. 2. E EXPERIMENT DETAILS: E.1 LINEAR MODEL To perform the linear model experiment outlined in Section 4, we first generated a dataset consisting of 10 random Gaussian clusters. Each cluster has a randomly sampled mean vector \u00b5i \u223c U(\u22123,3), and each \u00b5i \u2208 R32. With each mean vector, we also sample a corresponding covariance matrix \u03a3i \u223c Wishart(Vi) with 54 degrees of freedom (1.5 \u00d7 dimensionality). Vi is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal being sampled from U(.25, .35). We then sample 200 datapoints from each of the 10 Gaussians, resulting in a dataset with 1000 total instances. Further experimental settings can be found in Table 8. An example of the dataset in two dimensions with four clusters can be seen in Fig. 6. The student and teacher S, T \u2208 R32\u00d732 consist of a single weight matrix with a bias parameter. We randomly mask the components of the input vector according to the masking ratio. The goal of the linear model is then to reconstruct the full input given the masked input with a reconstruction Lr and consistency Lc loss according to the linear objectives in Eq. (7). E.2 IMAGENET EXPERIMENTS We follow the implementation details of the official MAE (He et al., 2022) code1 for all pre-training, fine-tuning and linear probing. While MAE uses only ViT-B and ViT-L, we also use ViT-S whose decoder consists of 4 Transformer blocks with 256 dimensions. While He et al. (2022) used 128 TPUv3 cores, we have tried to re-produce the baseline MAE and train our RC-MAE on the same local GPU environment, which has 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (32GB) for more accessibility in the community. Although the authors provide the guideline using 8 nodes with 8-GPUs (64-GPUs) in their official code written in Pytorch, we train RC-MAE and MAE on the same 8-GPUs environment. To do this, we use accum iter which the authors provide for accumulating gradients. However, when using accum iter, a reproducing issue2 3 occurs in that the re-produced result (MAE-ViTB) achieves slightly lower performance e.g., for ViT-B, 84.4% vs. 84.6% in end-to-end fine-tuning as shown in Table 4. Pre-training. Thanks to accum iter, we can set the same effective batch size of 4096 as MAE, e.g., 256 (batch size per gpu) \u00d7 8 (GPUs) \u00d7 2 (accum iter) for both ViT-B and ViT-S. For ViT-S, we set 512 (batch size per gpu) \u00d7 8 (GPUs) \u00d7 1 (accum iter). we follow the linear learning rate scaling rule (Goyal et al., 2017): lr = base lr \u00d7 batch size/256. The detail settings are shown in Table 9. End-to-End fine-tuning. Since MAE (He et al., 2022) does not have a ViT-S result, we train MAE and RC-MAE using ViT-S following the training protocol in BEiT (Bao et al., 2022). For ViTS, we use a layer-wise lr decay of 0.75, a stochastic drop path of 0.1, and a fine-tuning epoch of 300. We can expect that a more suitable hyper-parameter search boosts performance.

The detail settings are shown in Table 10. Linear probing. We use LARS (You et al., 2017) optimizer. The detail settings are shown in Table 11. Robustness Evaluation on ImageNet-variants We use the same model weights (RC-MAE w/ViTB for 1600epoch) fine-tuned on the original ImageNet-1K as shown in Table 4 and only test without any specialized fine-tuning on the different validation sets, such as ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019),-A (Hendrycks et al., 2021b),-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), and -Sketch (Wang et al., 2019). E.3 OBJECT DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION ON COCO Following the training protocol (Li et al., 2021) and implementation details as MAE (He et al., 2022), we fine-tune Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) with a ViT-Base backbone COCO dataset. To adapt the vanilla ViT with the isotropic structure (i.e., single-scale) for FPN (Lin et al., 2017) in the backbone of Mask R-CNN, we equally divide the ViT into four blocks and apply convolutions to downsample or upsample the intermediate features for building the multi-scale feature pyramid. For a fair comparison with MAE, we train both MAE and the proposed RC-MAE for 100 epochs with the same training protocol on the same 8 GPU environment: large-scale jitter (LSJ), AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) with half-periodic cosine learning rate decay, linear warmup, and drop path regularization (Huang et al., 2016) (e.g., 0.1 for ViT-Base). We use a batch size of 16 (2 per GPU), a learning rate of 4e-5, and a weight decay of 0.1. We implement models based on the reproduced Pytorch code4,5. F ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS: F.1 STUDENT VS. TEACHER NETWORKS. To determine which is better between student and teacher networks for transfer learning, we conduct fine-tuning and linear probing on ImageNet-1K by using each pre-trained weight. Table 12 shows the comparison between student and teacher networks. We find that the results of the teacher network are slightly higher than those of the student, which is similar to DINO (Caron et al., 2021). Thus, if unspecified, we use teacher network weight for downstream tasks. F.2 RESOURCE COMPARISON: MEMORY & COMPUTATION COST In terms of memory consumption and computation cost, we conduct resource comparison with the baseline method MAE 6 (He et al., 2022) and the self-distillation-based MIM methods, e.g., MSN 7 (Assran et al., 2022), iBOT 8 (Zhou et al., 2022), and BootMAE9 (Dong et al., 2022). We compare GPU memory usage and throughput while pre-training with ViT-L/16 on 8 V100-32GB GPUs as shown in Table 13. Memory usage is directly measured by using nvidia-smi command. Throughput is an average speed (images/second) for an epoch. We follow the original configuration for each method except batch size for a fair comparison. Batch sizes from 128 to 1,024 were employed to observe the scalability of the methods. We note that iBOT (Zhou et al., 2022) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022) could not run with batch sizes from 256, while other methods could deal even with a batch size of 1,024. iBOT feeds both masked and unmasked patches into the student encoder by following the masked image modeling employed in BeiT (Bao et al., 2022). Therefore, it requires 4\u00d7 memory usage of MAE-based methods for the student encoder. In addition, for further performance gain, iBOT exploits multiple local crops. Although we removed the local crops, 4https://github.com/hustvl/MIMDet 5At the time of submission of this paper, the official code of benchmarking ViT detection (Li et al., 2021) was not released. 6https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae 7https://github.com/facebookresearch/msn 8https://github.com/bytedance/ibot 9https://github.com/LightDXY/BootMAE memory usage was still 164GB which is much higher than MSE-based methods. MSN takes a lower masking ratio than other methods (0.5 vs. 0.75), resulting in 2\u00d7memory consumption for the student encoder.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: Exploring The Role of Mean Teachers in Self-supervised Masked Auto-Encoders\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is the de facto standard architecture in natural language processing (NLP), and has also surpassed state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (He et al., 2016; Tan & Le, 2019) (CNN) feature extractors in vision tasks through models such as the Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) (ViT). Prior to the advent of ViTs, self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms in the vision community (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020c; Grill et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021) utilized CNNs (e.g., ResNet (He et al., 2016)) as a backbone, performing instance discrimination pretext tasks through contrastive learning (He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020c). Interestingly, self-distillation schemes (Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021) using a teacher consisting of an exponential moving average (EMA) of the previous students, (i.e., a \u201cmean\u201d teacher) (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), have been shown to exhibit strong performance. Inspired by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training in NLP, recent SSL approaches (Bao et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) in the vision community have proposed forms of masked image modeling (MIM) pretext tasks, using ViT-based backbones. MIM is a simple pretext task which first randomly masks patches of an image, and then predicts the contents of the masked patches (i.e., tokens) using various reconstruction targets, e.g., visual tokens (Bao et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2021), semantic features (Zhou et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) and raw pixels (He et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). In particular, iBOT (Zhou et al., 2022) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022) use a self-distillation scheme for MIM by having the teacher network provide an encoded target (i.e., feature representation) to match the encoded features from the original image at a semantic feature level. Methods using semantic-level target representations exhibit strong performance on image-level classification tasks. On the contrary, SimMIM (Xie et al., 2022) and MAE (He et al., 2022) provide pixel-level reconstructions of masked patches, and lead to superior performance on dense prediction tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, self-distillation for pixel-level MIM has been under-explored as of yet. A recent SSL approach, BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), has shown that a slight architectural asymmetry between a student and EMA teacher can create a stable model which outperforms previous contrastive learning methods. The success of BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) inspired empirical (Chen & He, 2021) and theoretical (Tian et al., 2021) analyses into what enables BYOL to effectively learn and avoid collapse with the EMA Teacher during pre-training. Still, despite the popularity of the EMA Teacher in SSL, relatively little is known about how the teacher interacts with the student throughout the training process. In this work, we explore the dynamics of self-distillation in pixel-level MIM, e.g., MAE. Through analyzing a simple linear model, we investigate the dynamics between the gradients of an image reconstruction loss and a teacher consistency loss, learning that the gradients provided by the teacher conditionally adjust the current gradient by a weighted mixture of previous gradients based on the similarity between the current and previous features, acting as a conditional momentum regularizer. For example, Fig. 1(a) shows the case where the inputs which created the previous gradient momentum are similar to the ones which created the current gradients. In this case, the teacher makes a conditional correction to remove the previous direction from the momentum, allowing the student to learn from the newer knowledge. If however, the inputs which created both gradients are nearly orthogonal, the teacher would instead respond with minimal to no correction. We derive this conditional gradient effect in Proposition 4.1, and show evidence in both a simple linear model (Fig. 2) as well as in a deep ViT-based (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) MAE model (Fig. 3). To empirically validate our analysis of the contributions of EMA Teachers, we present a simple yet effective SSL approach, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE), by equipping MAE with an EMA Teacher, and providing a consistency target. Additionally, we study the effects of using different image masking strategies between the student and teacher models on the consistency objective, finding that using the same mask generally leads to better performance in both pre-training and downstream tasks. The same mask tends to form an orthogonal objective (Fig. 4(b)) to the reconstruction loss, which has been shown (Suteu & Guo, 2019; Ajemian et al., 2013) to be beneficial for multi-task models as there is limited interference between tasks. This observation may be of interest to any future SSL works which leverage multiple pre-training objectives. Our experiments follow the same architecture, settings, and pre-training recipe as MAE (He et al., 2022), and we find that the simple addition of a teacher (RC-MAE) consistently outperforms MAE in all model sizes (e.g., ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L) when fine-tuned for ImageNet classification. Additionally, we find that the teacher\u2019s conditional gradient correction we identified allows RC-MAE to converge faster compared to MAE (Fig. 1(b)), and RC-MAE outperforms recent self-distillation methods, MSN and iBOT, on dense prediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. Furthermore, compared to recent self-distillation methods utilizing a mean teacher, RC-MAE realizes more efficiency in computation and memory due to the fact that both networks receive only a subset of patches instead of the whole image. Our main contributions are as follows: 1. We analyze the contribution of EMA Teachers in self-supervised learning, finding that the gradient provided by the teachers conditionally adjusts current gradient direction and magnitude conditioned on the similarity of current and previous features. 2. Using this knowledge, we propose a simple, yet effective approach for self-supervised pre-training of Vision Transformers, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked AutoEncoder (RC-MAE), which improves over vanilla MAE in terms of speed of convergence, adversarial robustness, and performance on classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. 3. Thanks to its simplicity, RC-MAE achieves greater savings in both memory and computation compared to other state-of-the-art self-distillation-based MIM methods. 2 RELATED WORKS: In NLP, masked language modeling (MLM) is common for large-scale pre-training (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2018) by predicting masked words. Similarly, ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022) based masked image modeling (MIM) approaches (Zhou et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) for computer vision tasks have been proposed. These MIM approaches first apply a mask to patches of an image, and then the masked patches are predicted given the visible patches either at the token-level (Zhou et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022) or pixel-level (Chen et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 2022; He et al., 2022). Token-level masked patch prediction (Zhou et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022) predicts tokens or clusters of masked patches similar to MLM. Pixel-level prediction (Chen et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 2022; He et al., 2022) learns visual representations by reconstructing masked input patches at the RGB pixel-level. Additionally, self-distillation (Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021) has been deployed in MIM methods by utilizing a teacher constructed from an exponential moving average (EMA-Teacher) of student weights, providing an additional target for the student. iBOT (Zhou et al., 2022) gives a full view of an image (i.e., all patches) to the teacher network as an online tokenizer, offering a token-level target of the masked patches. Giving a masked view to the student and a full view to the teacher, MSN (Assran et al., 2022) makes the output embeddings from an EMATeacher serve as a semantic feature representation target to the student. Likewise, BootMAE (Dong et al., 2022) also adopts an EMA-Teacher, providing a feature-level target to the student on top of the pixel-level MIM approach. A key difference from these self-distillation MIM approaches is that RC-MAE provides only unmasked patches to the teacher and student, instead of the full image. As a result, RC-MAE shows better scalability compared with recent methods (see. Table 6). 3 PRELIMINARIES: The Masked Autoencoder. (MAE) (He et al., 2022) is a self-supervised approach with a ViT encoder f and decoder h, which randomly masks a portion of input patches, and then reconstructs the masked patches given the visible patches. Given an image X \u2208 RC\u00d7H\u00d7W , MAE patchifies X into N non-overlapping patches X\u0303 \u2208 RN\u00d7(P 2\u22c5C) with a patch size of P and randomly masks a subset of patches M (i.e., mask tokens). The subset of visible patches V is input to the encoder to achieve latent representations: z = f(V). Then, the decoder h attempts to reconstructM given the latent representations, Y\u0302 = h(z;M), where Y\u0302 \u2208 RN\u00d7(P 2\u22c5C) denotes the reconstructed patches. MAE utilizes the mean-squared error reconstruction loss Lr which is only computed on masked patches: Lr = 1 \u2223M\u2223 \u2211 i\u2208M \u2225X\u0303i \u2212 Y\u0302i\u2225 2 2 (1) The EMA Teacher. The mean teacher model (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) is a temporal ensemble of previous student weights which provides an additional target to the student. Doing so has been shown to reduce the number of labels needed to achieve the same level of accuracy, and has become a core part of recent state-of-the-art SSL approaches as reviewed in Section 2. Predictions from the student and teacher are compared via a function such as mean squared error (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) or cross-entropy (Caron et al., 2021). Generally, the teacher T is updated after every gradient step on the student S, using an exponential moving average of the student weights, T (t) = \u03b1T (t\u22121) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)S(t) = t \u2211 i=0 \u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)S(t\u2212i), (2) with a parameter \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1). The additional target forms a consistency loss Lc between the teacher and the student predictions. Considering the mean squared error loss, and Y\u0302 \u2032 being the prediction from the teacher model, Lc = 1 \u2223M\u2223 \u2211 i\u2208M \u2225Y\u0302i \u2212 Y\u0302 \u2032 i \u2225 2 2 (3) 4 THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER: Although EMA teachers are common in recent SSL approaches, relatively little is known about the interaction between the student and teacher. Through analysis of a linear model that mirrors a MAE+Teacher objective, we will show how the gradients of both models interact. Considering a linear model for the student S and teacher T consisting of a single weight matrix, like an MAE, the objective is to reconstruct the original input x from a masked input x\u0303 = x \u2299m, where \u2299 is an elementwise multiplication and m is a random binary mask with a predefined masking ratio. Proposition 4.1. With the reconstruction and consistency objective (Eqs. (1) and (3)), the gradient contribution of the teacher (\u2207SLc) adjusts the direction and magnitude of the reconstruction gradients (\u2207SLr). The magnitude and direction of the adjustment from the teacher are conditional based on the similarity between the current and previous features.

Please see Appendices B and B.1.1 The gradient of the consistency loss \u2207SLc is wholly represented by the last term on the RHS. Interestingly, there is a dot product x\u0302\u22bax\u0303 which gets distributed into every term of the sum. If we consider the dot product as cosine similarity cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = x\u0302\u22bax\u0303/\u2225x\u0302\u2225\u2225x\u0303\u2225, the possible cases for cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) for x\u0302 at a single arbitrary timestep t are as follows cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) \u2208 {\u22121,0,1, (0,1), (\u22121,0)}. Case 1: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) \u2208 {\u22121,1}. In this case, the resulting gradient from the last term on the RHS of Eq. (4) removes some amount of residual memory of the direction of a previous gradient. A cosine similarity of \u22231\u2223 also means the inputs are collinear, and the gradient is invariant to the sign of x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. Case 2: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = 0. In this case, There is zero contribution from the teacher for this term in the sum. Case 3: \u2223cos(x\u0302, x\u0303)\u2223 \u2208 (0,1). In this case, the component which contains the previous gradient will be weighted by the coefficient x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. In all cases, due to the sign of the last term on the RHS of Eq. (4), the gradient of consistency loss conditionally removes residual memory of previous gradients. The magnitude of the removal is likewise conditional, which can be seen by using the triangle inequality to upper bound the final term of Proposition 4.1 to see that, \u2225\u2207SLc\u2225 = \u2225 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i)x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 \u2264 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2225\u2207S(t\u2212i)[. . . x\u0302 \u22ba ]x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 (5) leading to the conclusion that the magnitude and direction of the consistency gradient directly results from the similarities to features in the recent learning history, as \u03b1i \u2208 (0,1) decays exponentially for distant timesteps in the past. The gradient of the student model can be bounded in a similar fashion, but without the decaying \u03b1 coefficients which makes the bound much looser in general (see Appendix B.1). Empirical Test. To test for this effect in a linear model, we conducted an experiment by training a linear model on data consisting of random samples x \u2208 R32 from random multivariate normal distributions (see Appendix E.1 for further details). After each training iteration, we sampled an extra batch of data, and for each single point in the batch we constructed sequences consisting of two inputs described in Table 1. We then took a single gradient step and teacher update for the first input and calculated the gradient of the reconstruction and consistency loss on the second input. Expected Outcome. Based on the similarity of the inputs, we would expect the consistency loss to produce a larger gradient for the same or similar inputs and a smaller gradient for different inputs. Additionally, the direction of the reconstruction and consistency gradient should be closer to opposite for case 1, and closer to orthogonal for case 3, with case 2 falling somewhere in-between. In Fig. 2, we in fact observe this trend, noticing that the reconstruction loss produces a significantly larger gradient when the second gradient step is on different inputs due to the looser bound in Eq. (9). Interpretation. This finding implies that the teacher plays a role of something akin to a gradient memory, where the teacher acts as a memory bank which retrieves the memory of recent gradients based on matching a query x\u0303 to a key x\u0302 in the memory bank. For novel inputs which do not match anything in recent memory, the teacher responds with a minimal correction, letting the student learn more from the reconstruction signal. If the query and key match, however, the teachers gradient will conditionally remove some directional information contained in the previous gradient. This allows the student to move in a direction which favors new knowledge gained from the current input, and cancels out some previous momentum. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). In Appendix D, we show that the same terms appear in the context of a deep model, with the dot product appearing at each semantic feature level. However, in a complex model with nonlinearities, the resulting gradient direction becomes harder to interpret. Even so, in Fig. 3, we empirically find the same underlying trend in the gradient norms and directions when analyzing RC-MAE (a ViT based model). 5 RECONSTRUCTION-CONSISTENT MASKED AUTO-ENCODER: In this section, we utilize the analysis from Section 4, and present a simple self-supervised approach, Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE). The overview of RC-MAE is illustrated in Fig. 1(c). RC-MAE is a ViT-based version of the simple linear model outlined in Section 4 where the total objective consists of a reconstruction and consistency loss from the original image and a mean teacher, respectively. The teacher network shares the same architecture as the student, consisting of an encoder f\u03b8t (e.g., ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021)) and a decoder h\u03b8t . At timestep t, the model parameters of the teacher \u03b8t are updated to be the exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model parameters \u03b8s (Eq. (2)). While BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and MSN (Assran et al., 2022) make the student network mimic the teachers semantic-level representation, for RC-MAE, the consistency and reconstruction targets are both pixel-level representations. We would expect that the two pixel-level objectives would lead to better performance on dense prediction tasks. Additionally, we would expect the conditional momentum corrections from the consistency gradient to allow a stable, faster rate of convergence, due to our interpretation in Section 4 of the momentum corrections supplied by the teacher. To investigate masking strategies for the teacher, we define two types of RC-MAE, RC-MAE-S and RC-MAE-D. RC-MAE-S uses the same mask tokens for both student and teacher networks. Conversely, RC-MAE-D, uses different mask tokens for each network. For both variants, given an image, we randomly sample respective mask tokensM with a mask ratio (e.g., 75% like MAE). The visible patches are then given to the student and teacher networks, which reconstruct all patches. With the consistency loss Eq. (3), the RC-MAE objective is: 1 \u2223M\u2223 \u2211 i\u2208M (\u2223\u2223X\u0303i \u2212 Y\u0302i\u2223\u2223 2 \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 reconstruction +\u2223\u2223Y\u0302i \u2212 Y\u0302 \u2032 i \u2223\u2223 2 \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 consistency ), (6) where i is the token index and Y\u0302 , Y\u0302 \u2032 denote the reconstructed patches from the decoders of the student and teacher networks, respectively. For the reconstruction target, we use standard normalized patch pixels as done with MAE (He et al., 2022). For RC-MAE-D the student and teacher process different visible patches, and the total loss is only calculated on the student\u2019s mask token locations Ms. Unless otherwise specified, RC-MAE means RC-MAE-S in the rest of this paper. 6 EXPERIMENTS: To validate the effectiveness of the EMA Teacher in RC-MAE, we compare RC-MAE to an otherwise identical MAE (He et al., 2022) baseline. We use ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) as an encoder and transformer decoder with the same depth and dimension as MAE. For a fair comparison with MAE, we follow the same implementation as MAE\u2019s official code. For experiments, we pre-train on ImageNet-1K and evaluate linear probing (LN) and end-to-end fine-tuning (FT) for classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation for which we use the Mask R-CNN benchmark (Li et al., 2021) for dense prediction. Further details regarding implementation and training settings can be found in Appendix E. Table 2: Different mask types for the teacher network in RC-MAE. The \u2018Same\u2019 means that the teacher network uses the same mask tokens as the student and \u2018Diff.\u2019 is the opposite. FT and LN denote end-to-end fine-tuning and linear probing on ImageNet-1K, respectively.

To investigate the effect of masking strategies between teacher and student, we evaluate RC-MAE variants against a plain MAE. Results are shown in Table 2. Both RC-MAE-S and RC-MAE-D outperform MAE, achieving a higher accuracy gap in linear probing (1.4% / 1.1%) compared to fine-tuning (0.2%). Notably, RC-MAE-S shows higher performance than RC-MAE-D on object detection and instance segmentation while the performance gap for classification slightly favors RC-MAE-D. To analyze the differences between RC-MAED and RC-MAE-S, we recorded the cosine similarity between the reconstruction and consistency gradients throughout training Fig. 4(b). We found that RC-MAE-D resulted in a cosine similarity with a positive bias, while RC-MAE-S appears to be centered near zero. We hypothesize that a conflict between the pixel-level reconstruction and consistency objectives causes the biased cosine similarity in RC-MAE-D, leading to lower pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning performance on these tasks. The base conflict likely stems from the fact that MAE models tend to give lower-quality reconstructions on visible patches. Therefore, when a patch is masked in the student but not the teacher, the teacher provides a low-quality target, interfering with the high-quality original input target. Masking ratio & Training epoch. We compare to MAE using different masking ratios, measuring pre-training time on the same 8-GPU machine. Per-iteration, RC-MAE is slower due to the added teacher network. However, compared to MAE with 75% mask & 1600 epochs (default), RC-MAE with 80% mask & 800 epochs achieves the same level of performance while using 55% less time. Fig. 1(b) illustrates fine-tuning accuracy curves of RC-MAE (75% mask & 800 epochs) and MAE (75% mask & 1600 epochs). It is easy to observe that RC-MAE reaches higher accuracy quicker than MAE. As the teacher is the only difference between the models, the increased rate of convergence is a direct result from the conditional teacher gradients.

Note that our reproduced MAE (e.g., ViT-B and ViTL) on the same 8 GPUs machine shows slightly lower accuracy than the original MAE due to a known reproduction issue. We assume that the slight difference in accuracy stems from the different GPU environments. For all ViT backbone sizes, RC-MAE consistently outperforms the reproduced MAE. While ViT-S and ViT-B achieve lower accuracy than iBOT or BootMAE, RC-MAE with ViTL surpasses the state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest that the reconstruction-consistent scheme could have stronger benefits for large-scale models. 6.3 OBJECT DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION ON COCO: To validate the pixel-level representation quality of RC-MAE, we analyze performance on object detection and instance segmentation on COCO (Lin et al., 2014). Following the same training protocol (Li et al., 2021) and implementation details as MAE (He et al., 2022), we fine-tune Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) with a ViT-Base backbone pre-trained by RC-MAE for 100 epochs. The training details are described in Appendix E.3. Table 5 summarizes the detection and segmentation results. RC-MAE improves over the MAE baseline by 0.7% box AP and 0.5% mask AP. We note that both RC-MAE and MAE outperform iBOT by large margins, even though iBOT shows higher ImageNet classification accuracy. These results suggest that the pure pixel-level objectives allow models to learn richer representations at the region or pixel-level. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 5, while iBOT and MSN attend to uncorrelated regions given the query patches, RC-MAE and MAE can focus more sharply on the pertinent regions near the query patches. These results indicate that pixel-level MIM is more advantageous than semantic-level MIM for dense prediction tasks. 6.4 RESOURCE COMPARISON: MEMORY AND COMPUTATION TIME: In terms of memory consumption and computation cost, we conduct a resource comparison with the self-distillation-based MIM methods, e.g., MSN, iBOT, and BootMAE as shown in Table 6. More details about how to measure are described in Appendix F.2. Since adding the EMA Teacher to MAE, RC-MAE shows more memory usage and runtime. However, compared with state-of-the-art self-distillation methods, RC-MAE requires less memory usage and computation cost. This result can be attributed to the fact that other methods feed the full image to the teacher network, whereas RC-MAE only delivers visible patches (no mask patches) to the teacher same as the student. 6.5 ROBUSTNESS EVALUATION ON IMAGENET: We evaluate the robustness of models on four ImageNet variants: ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019),-A (Hendrycks et al., 2021b),-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), and -Sketch (Wang et al., 2019), which are common benchmarks for evaluating robustness to perturbations. Table 7 shows the robustness comparison with MAE using the ViT-B backbone. RC-MAE outperforms MAE consistently on all robustness datasets, indicating that the conditional gradient corrections from the teacher result in a more robust solution. 7 CONCLUSION: In this work, we have provided an analysis along with empirical verifications of the nature of contributions from EMA teachers in self-supervised learning. We have found that teachers provide a momentum correction, conditionally removing previous gradient directions with magnitudes which are conditioned on current and previous feature similarities. Equipped with our analysis, we proposed a simple and effective self-supervised learning approach, RC-MAE, combining a masked autoencoder (MAE) with an EMA teacher. In experiments, we observed that the teacher enables MAE to converge faster and achieve a gain in ImageNet classification with increased robustness. Furthermore, RC-MAE outperforms recent self-supervised models on dense tasks. Since our aim is to analyze the dynamics of the EMA teacher, we design a simple approach to validate our findings, which results in better efficiency of both computation and memory compared to other self-distillation methods. For future works, we look forward to seeing further uses our analysis may lead to. For example, could the conditional corrections from the teacher be adequately incorporated into an Adam-like optimizer? If so this would remove the need to have a full model copy as a teacher and lead to cost savings and faster convergence in a wide variety of settings outside of self-supervised learning. 8 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT: In this section, we guide where the sections are for reproducibility. \u2022 Linear model experiments outlined in Section 4 \u2192 Appendix E.1 \u2022 ImageNet experiments such as pre-training, fine-tuning, linear probing, and robustness evaluation \u2192 Appendix E.2 \u2022 COCO object detection and instance segmentation \u2192 Appendix E.3 A APPENDIX: We will briefly describe the contents of each section of this appendix below: \u2022 Appendix B: Detailed Derivations of Proposition 4.1 the Main Text. \u2022 Appendix C: An Intuitive Explanation of Differences Between RC-MAE-D and RC-MAES. \u2022 Appendix D Does the Linear Model Extend to Deep Models? \u2022 Appendix E: Extra Experimental Details. \u2022 Appendix F: Additional Experiments Not Covered in the Main Text.

In essence, the MAE objective learns the transformation from square diagonal blocks to off-diagonal blocks of a feature covariance matrix. Setting the gradient of the reconstruction loss (which is the plain MAE objective) equal to zero, re-arranging and taking the expectation w.r.t the joint data and masking distribution p(x, x\u0303) we can see, 0 = Sx\u0303x\u0303\u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba xx\u0303\u22ba = Sx\u0303x\u0303\u22ba Ep(x,x\u0303)[xx\u0303\u22ba] = Ep(x,x\u0303)[Sx\u0303x\u0303\u22ba] Ep(x,x\u0303)[xx\u0303\u22ba] = S\u222c x,x\u0303 p(x, x\u0303)x\u0303x\u0303\u22badxdx\u0303 Ep(x,x\u0303)[xx\u0303\u22ba] = SEp(x\u0303)[x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba] \u03a3x,x\u0303 = S\u03a3x\u0303,x\u0303 This means that the optimal S represents the transformation which takes the square positive semidefinite covariance matrix \u03a3x\u0303,x\u0303 and transforms it into another off diagonal block of the covariance matrix \u03a3x,x\u0303, which is a part of some larger block covariance matrix, [ \u03a3x,x \u03a3x,x\u0303 \u03a3x\u0303,x \u03a3x\u0303,x\u0303 ] B.1 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER? Although the student-teacher paradigm with an EMA teacher is common Tarvainen & Valpola (2017); Grill et al. (2020); Assran et al. (2022); Zhou et al. (2022); Caron et al. (2021); Bao et al. (2022), it is still not well understood how the teacher objective directly interacts with and helps the student. In addition to the explanations in Section 4, here we will provide a complete derivation of Proposition 4.1. B.1.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4.1 The gradient contribution from the teacher and the consistency loss conditionally remove previous gradient directions based on similarities of current and previous features.

\u2207SLr With x\u0302 signifying a different i.i.d. sample from the dataset which was present in the previous batch. Therefore, by the last term on the RHS, the gradient of the consistency loss is composed of residual effects from the previous gradient steps on different inputs which will have different overall effects based on the result of x\u0302x\u0302\u22bax\u0303x\u0303\u22ba and xx\u0302\u22bax\u0303x\u0303\u22ba. Consider the cosine similarity cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = x\u0302\u22bax\u0303/\u2225x\u0302\u2225\u2225x\u0303\u2225, the possible cases for cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) are as follows cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) \u2208 {\u22121,0,1, (0,1), (\u22121,0)}. Case 1: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) \u2208 {\u22121,1}. For this case, a cosine similarity of \u22231\u2223means the points are collinear, existing in the same line, which makes the gradient invariant to the sign of x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. The removal of the previous gradient direction will have the largest impact in this case. Case 2: cos(x\u0302, x\u0303) = 0. For this case, x\u0302\u22bax\u0303 = 0, which zeros out the whole term. There is no removal of the previous gradient direction for this term in the recursion. Case 3: \u2223cos(x\u0302, x\u0303)\u2223 \u2208 (0,1). In this case, the component which contains the previous gradient will be weighted by the coefficient \u03b6 = x\u0302\u22bax\u0303. \u2207SLr +\u2207SLc = Sx\u0303x\u0303 \u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba \u2212 \u23a1 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a3 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03b6i\u03bb[Sx\u0302 \u2212 x + (S \u2212 T )x\u0302] (t\u2212i)\u23a4\u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a6 x\u0303\u22ba The generic linear model which has a gradient in the form of \u2202L \u2202\u0398 = (\u0398x\u0303\u2212x)x\u0303\u22ba, can be interpreted as a gradient direction and magnitude for every component in the vector (\u0398x\u0303 \u2212 x) with a further conditional direction and magnitude projected to the components of \u0398 by the final x\u0303\u22ba term. Therefore, in each case above, the weight given to the gradient of each element of S is weighted conditionally based on dot product x\u0302\u22bax\u0303, and the final projection of the current feature x\u0303\u22ba. Remark B.2. 1 The upper bound on the gradient of the consistency loss can be bounded with the triangle inequality. We can examine the following term which uses the previous result from Eq. (8), \u2207SLc = \u2212[ t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) ]x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba distributing the the outer terms and using the triangle inequality, we can see that, \u2225\u2207SLc\u2225 = \u2225[ t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i)]x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 \u2264 t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2225\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i)x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 The most significant (judged by \u03b1 coefficients) term in the upper bound of the norm of the consistency loss is when i = 1. Therefore the norm of the consistency loss from the teacher is likely to decrease if the current input is not similar to the previous input. Likewise, the most significant term in the upper bound increases when the current input has a high similarity to the input x\u0302(t\u22121). One should also note that the upper bound of the reconstruction loss can be decomposed via a similar line of reasoning, G(Lr) = Sx\u0303x\u0303 \u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba = (S(t\u22121) \u2212 \u03bb\u2207S(t\u22121)L (t\u22121) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba = (S(0) \u2212 \u03bb t \u2211 i=1 \u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba \u2212 xx\u0303\u22ba Focusing only on the non constant terms, we can see that, \u2225 t \u2211 i=1 (\u03bb\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 \u2264 t \u2211 i=1 \u03bb\u2225\u2207S(t\u2212i)L (t\u2212i) )x\u0303x\u0303\u22ba\u2225 (9) It is easy to see there are no exponentially decreasing coefficients on the terms for the previous time steps, making the upper bound for the reconstruction loss larger than that of the consistency loss. This should lead to the reconstruction loss having a larger gradient contribution for novel inputs when compared to the consistency loss, as empirically shown in Figs. 2 and 3. C WHY DOES RC-MAE-S OUTPERFORM RC-MAE-D: RC-MAE-S uses the same mask between the teacher and the student, while RC-MAE-D uses a different mask between the teacher and the student. Empirically, we observed a difference in cosine similarity between the gradients of Lr and Lc for the different masking strategies in the consistency loss as depicted in (Fig. 4). In general, a different masking strategy x\u0303 and x\u0302 forces Sx\u0303 towards the prediction of T x\u0302 but there is no reason to expect that this objective aligns well with the original reconstruction target in practice. For example, MAE models are known to give poor reconstructions on masked patches, because the masked patches do not receive any gradient signal during the pre-training phase. Therefore, on patches which are unmasked in the student and masked in the teacher, RC-MAE-D provides a consistency objective which interferes with the reconstruction objective by giving a noisy target of lower quality, which is the likely cause which leads to worse pre-training performance as shown in Fig. 4 and also lower finetuning performance as shown in Table 2. D DO THE FINDINGS FROM THE LINEAR MODEL EXTEND TO DEEP MODELS?: Although we have analyzed a simple linear model, a more complex deep model with non-linearities can be broken down in a similar way. To see this with a simple network consisting of a single hidden layer B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) with an elementwise non-linearity \u03c3, and a quadratic consistency loss Lc = 1 2 \u2225B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2212D\u03c3(Cx\u0303)\u222522, where the teacher weights are {C,D}, the teacher at a single layer can be expanded according to, D\u03c3(Cx\u0303) =D\u03c3([(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A + \u03b1C(t\u22121)]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A(t\u2212i)]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([(1 \u2212 \u03b1)A + t \u2211 i=1 [\u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(A + \u03bb t\u22121 \u2211 j=t\u2212i \u2207A(i)L (j))]]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 [\u03b1i(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(\u03bb t\u22121 \u2211 j=t\u2212i \u2207A(j)L (j))]]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb\u2207At\u2212iL (t\u2212i)]x\u0303) =D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb[. . . x\u0302\u22ba](t\u2212i)]x\u0303) where the fourth step is a result of rearranging the sums following the same steps as Eq. (8). The term [. . . x\u0302\u22ba] results from the fact that we know the previous gradient ends with the term x\u0302\u22ba, where x\u0302 is another i.i.d. sample from a previous batch, due to the chain rule applied as follows, \u2202L \u2202A = \u2202L dB\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2202Ax\u0303 \u2202Ax\u0303 \u2202A = [(B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2212D\u03c3(Cx\u0303))\u22baB diag(\u03c3\u2032(Ax\u0303))] \u22ba x\u0303\u22ba = [(B\u03c3(Ax\u0303) \u2212D\u03c3([A + t \u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03bb[. . . x\u0302\u22ba](t\u2212i)]x\u0303)) \u22ba B diag(\u03c3\u2032(Ax\u0303))] \u22ba x\u0303\u22ba This shows that although intermediate representations are more complicated, they contain similar terms, and the dot product term is present at every intermediate representation. Having this term in each semantic feature space is useful, as the dot product in the high dimensional pixel space may carry less meaning. Empirically, we observed the same overall effects in the deep ViT based RC-MAE Fig. 3 as we did in the simple linear model Fig. 2. E EXPERIMENT DETAILS: E.1 LINEAR MODEL To perform the linear model experiment outlined in Section 4, we first generated a dataset consisting of 10 random Gaussian clusters. Each cluster has a randomly sampled mean vector \u00b5i \u223c U(\u22123,3), and each \u00b5i \u2208 R32. With each mean vector, we also sample a corresponding covariance matrix \u03a3i \u223c Wishart(Vi) with 54 degrees of freedom (1.5 \u00d7 dimensionality). Vi is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal being sampled from U(.25, .35). We then sample 200 datapoints from each of the 10 Gaussians, resulting in a dataset with 1000 total instances. Further experimental settings can be found in Table 8. An example of the dataset in two dimensions with four clusters can be seen in Fig. 6. The student and teacher S, T \u2208 R32\u00d732 consist of a single weight matrix with a bias parameter. We randomly mask the components of the input vector according to the masking ratio. The goal of the linear model is then to reconstruct the full input given the masked input with a reconstruction Lr and consistency Lc loss according to the linear objectives in Eq. (7). E.2 IMAGENET EXPERIMENTS We follow the implementation details of the official MAE (He et al., 2022) code1 for all pre-training, fine-tuning and linear probing. While MAE uses only ViT-B and ViT-L, we also use ViT-S whose decoder consists of 4 Transformer blocks with 256 dimensions. While He et al. (2022) used 128 TPUv3 cores, we have tried to re-produce the baseline MAE and train our RC-MAE on the same local GPU environment, which has 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (32GB) for more accessibility in the community. Although the authors provide the guideline using 8 nodes with 8-GPUs (64-GPUs) in their official code written in Pytorch, we train RC-MAE and MAE on the same 8-GPUs environment. To do this, we use accum iter which the authors provide for accumulating gradients. However, when using accum iter, a reproducing issue2 3 occurs in that the re-produced result (MAE-ViTB) achieves slightly lower performance e.g., for ViT-B, 84.4% vs. 84.6% in end-to-end fine-tuning as shown in Table 4. Pre-training. Thanks to accum iter, we can set the same effective batch size of 4096 as MAE, e.g., 256 (batch size per gpu) \u00d7 8 (GPUs) \u00d7 2 (accum iter) for both ViT-B and ViT-S. For ViT-S, we set 512 (batch size per gpu) \u00d7 8 (GPUs) \u00d7 1 (accum iter). we follow the linear learning rate scaling rule (Goyal et al., 2017): lr = base lr \u00d7 batch size/256. The detail settings are shown in Table 9. End-to-End fine-tuning. Since MAE (He et al., 2022) does not have a ViT-S result, we train MAE and RC-MAE using ViT-S following the training protocol in BEiT (Bao et al., 2022). For ViTS, we use a layer-wise lr decay of 0.75, a stochastic drop path of 0.1, and a fine-tuning epoch of 300. We can expect that a more suitable hyper-parameter search boosts performance.

Config Value optimizer AdamW L, we can set the effective batch size to 1024 by using accum iter, e.g., 64 (batch size per gpu) \u00d7 8 (GPUs) \u00d7 2 (accum iter). The detail settings are shown in Table 10. Linear probing. We use LARS (You et al., 2017) optimizer. The detail settings are shown in Table 11. Robustness Evaluation on ImageNet-variants We use the same model weights (RC-MAE w/ViTB for 1600epoch) fine-tuned on the original ImageNet-1K as shown in Table 4 and only test without any specialized fine-tuning on the different validation sets, such as ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019),-A (Hendrycks et al., 2021b),-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), and -Sketch (Wang et al., 2019). E.3 OBJECT DETECTION AND SEGMENTATION ON COCO Following the training protocol (Li et al., 2021) and implementation details as MAE (He et al., 2022), we fine-tune Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) with a ViT-Base backbone COCO dataset. To adapt the vanilla ViT with the isotropic structure (i.e., single-scale) for FPN (Lin et al., 2017) in the backbone of Mask R-CNN, we equally divide the ViT into four blocks and apply convolutions to downsample or upsample the intermediate features for building the multi-scale feature pyramid. For a fair comparison with MAE, we train both MAE and the proposed RC-MAE for 100 epochs with the same training protocol on the same 8 GPU environment: large-scale jitter (LSJ), AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) with half-periodic cosine learning rate decay, linear warmup, and drop path regularization (Huang et al., 2016) (e.g., 0.1 for ViT-Base). We use a batch size of 16 (2 per GPU), a learning rate of 4e-5, and a weight decay of 0.1. We implement models based on the reproduced Pytorch code4,5. F ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS: F.1 STUDENT VS. TEACHER NETWORKS. To determine which is better between student and teacher networks for transfer learning, we conduct fine-tuning and linear probing on ImageNet-1K by using each pre-trained weight. Table 12 shows the comparison between student and teacher networks. We find that the results of the teacher network are slightly higher than those of the student, which is similar to DINO (Caron et al., 2021). Thus, if unspecified, we use teacher network weight for downstream tasks. F.2 RESOURCE COMPARISON: MEMORY & COMPUTATION COST In terms of memory consumption and computation cost, we conduct resource comparison with the baseline method MAE 6 (He et al., 2022) and the self-distillation-based MIM methods, e.g., MSN 7 (Assran et al., 2022), iBOT 8 (Zhou et al., 2022), and BootMAE9 (Dong et al., 2022). We compare GPU memory usage and throughput while pre-training with ViT-L/16 on 8 V100-32GB GPUs as shown in Table 13. Memory usage is directly measured by using nvidia-smi command. Throughput is an average speed (images/second) for an epoch. We follow the original configuration for each method except batch size for a fair comparison. Batch sizes from 128 to 1,024 were employed to observe the scalability of the methods. We note that iBOT (Zhou et al., 2022) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022) could not run with batch sizes from 256, while other methods could deal even with a batch size of 1,024. iBOT feeds both masked and unmasked patches into the student encoder by following the masked image modeling employed in BeiT (Bao et al., 2022). Therefore, it requires 4\u00d7 memory usage of MAE-based methods for the student encoder. In addition, for further performance gain, iBOT exploits multiple local crops. Although we removed the local crops, 4https://github.com/hustvl/MIMDet 5At the time of submission of this paper, the official code of benchmarking ViT detection (Li et al., 2021) was not released. 6https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae 7https://github.com/facebookresearch/msn 8https://github.com/bytedance/ibot 9https://github.com/LightDXY/BootMAE memory usage was still 164GB which is much higher than MSE-based methods. MSN takes a lower masking ratio than other methods (0.5 vs. 0.75), resulting in 2\u00d7memory consumption for the student encoder."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I will review the paper \"Exploring The Role of Mean Teachers in Self-supervised Masked Auto-Encoders\" for ICLR 2023.

serve as an ICLR 2023 reviewer. Your contribution as a reviewer is paramount to creating an exciting and high-quality program. We ask that:\\n\\nYour reviews are timely and substantive.\\nYou follow the reviewing guidelines below.\u00a0\\nYou adhere to our Code of Ethics in your role as a reviewer. You must also adhere to our Code of Conduct.\\n\\nThis guide is intended to help you understand the ICLR 2023 decision process and your role within it. It contains:\\n\\nAn outline of the main reviewer tasks\\nStep-by-step reviewing instructions (especially relevant for reviewers that are new to ICLR)\\nReview examples\\nAn FAQ.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\nWe\u2019re counting on you\\nAs a reviewer you are central to the program creation process for ICLR 2023. Your Area Chairs (ACs), Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and the Program Chairs (PCs) will rely greatly on your expertise and your diligent and thorough reviews to make decisions on each paper. Therefore, your role as a reviewer is critical to ensuring a strong program for ICLR 2023.\\nHigh-quality reviews are also very valuable for helping authors improve their work, whether it is eventually accepted by ICLR 2023, or not. Therefore it is important to treat each valid ICLR 2023 submission with equal care.\\nAs a token of our appreciation for your essential work, top reviewers will be acknowledged permanently on the ICLR 2023 website. Furthermore, top and high quality reviewers will receive special acknowledgement during the opening ceremony and free registration to ICLR 2023.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nMain reviewer tasks\\nThe main reviewer tasks and dates are as follows:\\n\\nCreate or update your OpenReview profile (September 30 2022)\\nBid on papers (September 30 2022 - October 06 2022)\\nWrite a constructive, thorough and timely review (October 12 2022 - October 24 2022)\\nInitial paper reviews released (November 4 2022)\\nDiscuss with authors and other reviewers to clarify and improve the paper (November 4 2022 - November 18 2022)\\nFlag any potential CoE violations and/or concerns (by November 18 2022)\\nProvide a recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (by November 18 2022)\\nVirtual Meeting with AC if paper you reviewed falls into borderline papers (November 18 2022 - December 12 2022)\\nProvide a final recommendation to the area chair assigned to the paper (after Virtual Meeting)\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\nCode of Ethics\\nAll ICLR participants, including reviewers, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics). All reviewers are required to read the Code of Ethics and adhere to it. The Code of Ethics applies to all conference participation, including paper submission, reviewing, and paper discussion.\u00a0\\nAs part of the review process, reviewers are asked to raise potential violations of the ICLR Code of Ethics. Note that authors are encouraged to discuss questions and potential issues regarding the Code of Ethics as part of their submission. This discussion is not counted against the maximum page limit of the paper and should be included as a separate section.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReviewing a submission: step-by-step\\nSummarized in one sentence, a review aims to determine whether a submission will bring sufficient value to the community and contribute new knowledge. The process can be broken down into the following main reviewer tasks:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRead the paper: It\u2019s important to carefully read through the entire paper, and to look up any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself sufficient time for this step.\\nWhile reading, consider the following:\\n\\nObjective of the work: What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations as to potential value and impact.\\nStrong points: is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible, does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?\\nWeak points: is it weak in any of the aspects listed in b.?\\nBe mindful of potential biases and try to be open-minded about the value and interest a paper can hold for the entire ICLR community, even if it may not be very interesting for you.\\n\\n\\nAnswer four key questions for yourself, to make a recommendation to Accept or Reject:\\n\\nWhat is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?\\nIs the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\\nDoes the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\\nWhat is the significance of the work? Does it contribute new knowledge and sufficient value to the community? Note, this does not necessarily require state-of-the-art results. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge (incl., empirical, theoretical, for practitioners, etc).\\n\\n\\nWrite and submit your initial review, organizing it as follows:\u00a0\\n\\nSummarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.\\nList strong and weak points of the paper. Be as comprehensive as possible.\\nClearly state your initial recommendation (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\\nProvide supporting arguments for your recommendation.\\nAsk questions you would like answered by the authors to help you clarify your understanding of the paper and provide the additional evidence you need to be confident in your assessment.\u00a0\\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\\n\\n\\nComplete the CoE report: ICLR has adopted the following Code of Ethics (CoE). When submitting your review, you\u2019ll be asked to complete a CoE report for the paper. The report is a simple form with two questions. The first asks whether there is a potential violation of the CoE. The second is relevant only if there is a potential violation and asks the reviewer to explain why there may be a potential violation. In order to answer these questions, it is therefore important that you read the CoE before starting your reviews. \\n\\t\u00a0\\nEngage in discussion: The discussion phase at ICLR is different from most conferences in the AI/ML community. During this phase, reviewers, authors and area chairs engage in asynchronous discussion and authors are allowed to revise their submissions to address concerns that arise. It is crucial that you are actively engaged during this phase. Maintain a spirit of openness to changing your initial recommendation (either to a more positive or more negative) rating.\\nBorderline paper meeting: This year, we are introducing a new program for ACs to (virtually) meet and discuss with reviewers only for borderline cases. ACs will reach out to schedule this meeting. This is to ensure active discussions among reviewers, and well-thought-out decisions. ACs will schedule the meeting and facilitate the discussion. For a productive discussion, it is important to familiarize yourself with other reviewers' feedback prior to the meeting. Please note that we will be leveraging information for reviewers who failed to attend this meeting (excluding emergencies).\u00a0\\nProvide final recommendation: Update your review, taking into account the new information collected during the discussion phase, and any revisions to the submission. State your reasoning and what did/didn\u2019t change your recommendation throughout the discussion phase.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nFor great in-depth resources on reviewing, see these resources:\\n\\nDaniel Dennet, Criticising with Kindness.\\nComprehensive advice: Mistakes Reviewers Make\\nViews from multiple reviewers: Last minute reviewing advice\\nPerspective from instructions to Area Chairs: Dear ACs.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReview Examples\\nHere are two sample reviews from previous conferences that give an example of what we consider a good review for the case of leaning-to-accept and leaning-to-reject.\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Accept\\nThis paper proposes a method, Dual-AC, for optimizing the actor (policy) and critic (value function) simultaneously which takes the form of a zero-sum game resulting in a principled method for using the critic to optimize the actor. In order to achieve that, they take the linear programming approach of solving the Bellman optimality equations, outline the deficiencies of this approach, and propose solutions to mitigate those problems. The discussion on the deficiencies of the naive LP approach is mostly well done. Their main contribution is extending the single step LP formulation to a multi-step dual form that reduces the bias and makes the connection between policy and value function optimization much clearer without losing convexity by applying a regularization. They perform an empirical study in the Inverted Double Pendulum domain to conclude that their extended algorithm outperforms the naive linear programming approach without the improvements. Lastly, there are empirical experiments done to conclude the superior performance of Dual-AC in contrast to other actor-critic algorithms.\u00a0\\nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, with the caveat for some clarifications on the theory and experiments. Given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score.\u00a0\\nFor the theory, there are a few steps that need clarification and further clarification on novelty. For novelty, it is unclear if Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are both being stated as novel results. It looks like Theorem 2 has already been shown in \\\"Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision Problem in Nearly-Linear Running Time\u201d. There is a statement that \u201cChen & Wang (2016); Wang (2017) apply stochastic first-order algorithms (Nemirovski et al., 2009) for the one-step Lagrangian of the LP problem in reinforcement learning setting. However, as we discussed in Section 3, their algorithm is restricted to tabular parametrization\u201d. Is your Theorem 2 somehow an extension? Is Theorem 3 completely new?\\nThis is particularly called into question due to the lack of assumptions about the function class for value functions. It seems like the value function is required to be able to represent the true value function, which can be almost as restrictive as requiring tabular parameterizations (which can represent the true value function). This assumption seems to be used right at the bottom of Page 17, where U^{pi*} = V^*. Further, eta_v must be chosen to ensure that it does not affect (constrain) the optimal solution, which implies it might need to be very small. More about conditions on eta_v would be illuminating.\u00a0\\nThere is also one step in the theorem that I cannot verify. On Page 18, how is the squared removed for difference between U and Upi? The transition from the second line of the proof to the third line is not clear. It would also be good to more clearly state on page 14 how you get the first inequality, for || V^* ||_{2,mu}^2.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed.\\n1. It would have been better to also show the performance graphs with and without the improvements for multiple domains.\\n2. The central contribution is extending the single step LP to a multi-step formulation. It would be beneficial to empirically demonstrate how increasing k (the multi-step parameter) affects the performance gains.\\n3. Increasing k also comes at a computational cost. I would like to see some discussions on this and how long dual-AC takes to converge in comparison to the other algorithms tested (PPO and TRPO).\\n4. The authors concluded the presence of local convexity based on hessian inspection due to the use of path regularization. It was also mentioned that increasing the regularization parameter size increases the convergence rate. Empirically, how does changing the regularization parameter affect the performance in terms of reward maximization? In the experimental section of the appendix, it is mentioned that multiple regularization settings were tried but their performance is not mentioned. Also, for the regularization parameters that were tried, based on hessian inspection, did they all result in local convexity? A bit more discussion on these choices would be helpful.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nMinor comments:\\n1. Page 2: In equation 5, there should not be a 'ds' in the dual variable constraint\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Reject\\nThis paper introduces a variation on temporal difference learning for the function approximation case that attempts to resolve the issue of over-generalization across temporally-successive states. The new approach is applied to both linear and non-linear function approximation, and for prediction and control problems. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments in classic benchmark control domains (Mountain Car and Acrobot), and in Pong.\\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or practice, (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve (nor differentiates it from the usual problem of generalizing well), (3) the experiments are difficult to understand, missing many details, and generally do not support a significant contribution, and (4) the paper is imprecise and unpolished.\\nMain argument\\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that the problem it is trying to solve is a real thing. There is no experiment in this paper that clearly shows how this temporal generalization problem is different from the need to generalize well with function approximation. The paper points to references to establish the existence of the problem, but for example the Durugkar and Stone paper is a workshop paper and the conference version of that paper was rejected from ICLR 2018 and the reviewers highlighted serious issues with the paper\u2014that is not work to build upon. Further the paper under review here claims this problem is most pressing in the non-linear case, but the analysis in section 4.1 is for the linear case.\u00a0\\nThe resultant algorithm does not seem well justified, and has a different fixed point than TD, but there is no discussion of this other than section 4.4, which does not make clear statements about the correctness of the algorithm or what it converges to. Can you provide a proof or any kind of evidence that the proposed approach is sound, or how it\u2019s fixed point relates to TD?\\nThe experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches. There are so many missing details it is difficult to draw many conclusions:\\n\\nWhat was the policy used in exp1 for policy evaluation in MC?\\nWhy Fourier basis features?\\nIn MC with DQN how did you adjust the parameters and architecture for the MC task?\\nWas the reward in MC and Acrobot -1 per step or something else\\nHow did you tune the parameters in the MC and Acrobot experiments?\\nWhy so few runs in MC, none of the results presented are significant?\\nWhy is the performance so bad in MC?\\nDid you evaluate online learning or do tests with the greedy policy?\\nHow did you initialize the value functions and weights?\\nWhy did you use experience replay for the linear experiments?\\nIN MC and Acrobot why only a one layer MLP?\\n\\nIgnoring all that, the results are not convincing. Most of the results in the paper are not statistically significant. The policy evaluation results in MC show little difference to regular TD. The Pong results show DQN is actually better. This makes the reader wonder if the result with DQN on MC and Acrobot are only worse because you did not properly tune DQN for those domains, whereas the default DQN architecture is well tuned for Atari and that is why you method is competitive in the smaller domains.\u00a0\\nThe differences in the \u201caverage change in value plots\u201d are very small if the rewards are -1 per step. Can you provide some context to understand the significance of this difference? In the last experiment linear FA and MC, the step-size is set equal for all methods\u2014this is not a valid comparison. Your method may just work better with alpha = 0.1.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\nThe paper has many imprecise parts, here are a few:\\n\\nThe definition of the value function would be approximate not equals unless you specify some properties of the function approximation architecture. Same for the Bellman equation\\nequation 1 of section 2.1 is neither an algorithm or a loss function\\nTD does not minimize the squared TD. Saying that is the objective function of TD learning in not true\\nend of section 2.1 says \u201cIt is computed as\u201d but the following equation just gives a form for the partial derivative\\nequation 2, x is not bounded\u00a0\\nYou state TC-loss has an unclear solution property, I don\u2019t know what that means and I don\u2019t think your approach is well justified either\\nSection 4.1 assumes linear FA, but its implied up until paragraph 2 that it has not assumed linear\\ntreatment of n_t in alg differs from appendix (t is no time episode number)\\nYour method has a n_t parameter that is adapted according to a schedule seemingly giving it an unfair advantage over DQN.\\nOver-claim not supported by the results: \u201cwe see that HR-TD is able to find a representation that is better at keeping the target value separate than TC is \u201c. The results do not show this.\\nSection 4.4 does not seem to go anywhere or produce and tangible conclusions\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to follow how the prox operator is used in the development of the alg, this could use some higher level explanation\\nIntro p2 is about bootstrapping, use that term and remove the equations\\nIt\u2019s not clear why you are talking about stochastic vs deterministic in P3\\nPerhaps you should compare against a MC method in the experiments to demonstrate the problem with TD methods and generalization\\nSection 2: \u201ccan often be a regularization term\u201d >> can or must be?\\nupdate law is an odd term\\n\u00a0tends to alleviate\u201d >> odd phrase\\nsection 4 should come before section 3\\nAlg 1 in not helpful because it just references an equation\\nsection 4.4 is very confusing, I cannot follow the logic of the statements\u00a0\\nQ learning >> Q-learning\\nNot sure what you mean with the last sentence of p2 section 5\\nwhere are the results for Acrobot linear function approximation\\nappendix Q-learning with linear FA is not DQN (table 2)\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nFAQ for Reviewers\\nQ. The review I just submitted is not appearing! Did it go thru?\\nA. There seems to be some delay in the system for you to see your reviews. Just give a bit of time and refresh again.\\n\u00a0\\nQ. What is the borderline paper meeting between AC and reviewers about?\\nA. This year we require ACs to meet with reviewers for all borderline papers (defined and announced by PCs once all reviews are received). There will be one meeting per borderline paper. Once we receive all reviews, we will let ACs know which papers fall into this bucket. ACs will then schedule and run the meetings with the reviewers of the papers in question.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: What if I can not attend the meeting?\\nA: Please work with your AC to find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. Note that the discussion phase is roughly 1 month long, and overlaps with the NeurIPS conference, in case in-person meeting is preferred. All reviewers agreed to participate in review meetings when they accepted the reviewer invitations. An AC has right to\u00a0 downweight the review of reviewers who refuse to attend the meeting.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: How should I use supplementary material?\\nA: It is not necessary to read supplementary material but such material can often answer questions that arise while reading the main paper, so consider looking there before asking authors.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: How should I handle a policy violation?\\nA: To flag a CoE violation related to a submission, please indicate it when submitting the CoE report for that paper. The AC will work with the PC and the ethics board to resolve the case. To discuss other violations (e.g. plagiarism, double submission, paper length, formatting, etc.), please contact either the AC/SAC or the PC as appropriate. You can do this by sending a confidential comment with the appropriate readership restrictions.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: Am I allowed to ask for additional experiments?\\nA: You can ask for additional experiments. New experiments should not significantly change the content of the submission. Rather, they should be limited in scope and serve to more thoroughly validate existing results from the submission.\\n\u00a0\\n\\nQ: If a submission does not achieve state-of-the-art results, is that grounds for rejection?\\nA: No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge. Submissions can achieve this without achieving state-of-the-art results.\\nQ: Are authors expected to cite and compare with very recent work? What about non peer-reviewed (e.g., ArXiv) papers? (updated on 7 November 2022)\\nA: We consider papers contemporaneous if they are published (available in online proceedings) within the last four months. That means, since our full paper deadline is September 28, if a paper was published (i.e., at a peer-reviewed venue) on or after May 28, 2022, authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper. Authors are encouraged to cite and discuss all relevant papers, but they may be excused for not knowing about papers not published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals, which includes papers exclusively available on arXiv. Reviewers are encouraged to use their own good judgement and, if in doubt, discuss with their area chair.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Page Load\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        ICLR uses cookies for essential functions only.

The process can be broken down into the following main reviewer tasks:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nRead the paper: It\u2019s important to carefully read through the entire paper, and to look up any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself sufficient time for this step.\\nWhile reading, consider the following:\\n\\nObjective of the work: What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations as to potential value and impact.\\nStrong points: is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible, does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?\\nWeak points: is it weak in any of the aspects listed in b.?\\nBe mindful of potential biases and try to be open-minded about the value and interest a paper can hold for the entire ICLR community, even if it may not be very interesting for you.\\n\\n\\nAnswer four key questions for yourself, to make a recommendation to Accept or Reject:\\n\\nWhat is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?\\nIs the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\\nDoes the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\\nWhat is the significance of the work? Does it contribute new knowledge and sufficient value to the community? Note, this does not necessarily require state-of-the-art results. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge (incl., empirical, theoretical, for practitioners, etc).\\n\\n\\nWrite and submit your initial review, organizing it as follows:\\xa0\\n\\nSummarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.\\nList strong and weak points of the paper. Be as comprehensive as possible.\\nClearly state your initial recommendation (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\\nProvide supporting arguments for your recommendation.\\nAsk questions you would like answered by the authors to help you clarify your understanding of the paper and provide the additional evidence you need to be confident in your assessment.\\xa0\\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\\n\\n\\nComplete the CoE report: ICLR has adopted the following Code of Ethics (CoE). When submitting your review, you\u2019ll be asked to complete a CoE report for the paper. The report is a simple form with two questions. The first asks whether there is a potential violation of the CoE. The second is relevant only if there is a potential violation and asks the reviewer to explain why there may be a potential violation. In order to answer these questions, it is therefore important that you read the CoE before starting your reviews. \\n\\t\\xa0\\nEngage in discussion: The discussion phase at ICLR is different from most conferences in the AI/ML community. During this phase, reviewers, authors and area chairs engage in asynchronous discussion and authors are allowed to revise their submissions to address concerns that arise. It is crucial that you are actively engaged during this phase. Maintain a spirit of openness to changing your initial recommendation (either to a more positive or more negative) rating.\\nBorderline paper meeting: This year, we are introducing a new program for ACs to (virtually) meet and discuss with reviewers only for borderline cases. ACs will reach out to schedule this meeting. This is to ensure active discussions among reviewers, and well-thought-out decisions. ACs will schedule the meeting and facilitate the discussion. For a productive discussion, it is important to familiarize yourself with other reviewers\\' feedback prior to the meeting. Please note that we will be leveraging information for reviewers who failed to attend this meeting (excluding emergencies).\\xa0\\nProvide final recommendation: Update your review, taking into account the new information collected during the discussion phase, and any revisions to the submission. State your reasoning and what did/didn\u2019t change your recommendation throughout the discussion phase.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor great in-depth resources on reviewing, see these resources:\\n\\nDaniel Dennet, Criticising with Kindness.\\nComprehensive advice: Mistakes Reviewers Make\\nViews from multiple reviewers: Last minute reviewing advice\\nPerspective from instructions to Area Chairs: Dear ACs.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReview Examples\\nHere are two sample reviews from previous conferences that give an example of what we consider a good review for the case of leaning-to-accept and leaning-to-reject.\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Accept\\nThis paper proposes a method, Dual-AC, for optimizing the actor (policy) and critic (value function) simultaneously which takes the form of a zero-sum game resulting in a principled method for using the critic to optimize the actor. In order to achieve that, they take the linear programming approach of solving the Bellman optimality equations, outline the deficiencies of this approach, and propose solutions to mitigate those problems. The discussion on the deficiencies of the naive LP approach is mostly well done. Their main contribution is extending the single step LP formulation to a multi-step dual form that reduces the bias and makes the connection between policy and value function optimization much clearer without losing convexity by applying a regularization. They perform an empirical study in the Inverted Double Pendulum domain to conclude that their extended algorithm outperforms the naive linear programming approach without the improvements. Lastly, there are empirical experiments done to conclude the superior performance of Dual-AC in contrast to other actor-critic algorithms.\\xa0\\nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, with the caveat for some clarifications on the theory and experiments. Given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score.\\xa0\\nFor the theory, there are a few steps that need clarification and further clarification on novelty. For novelty, it is unclear if Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are both being stated as novel results. It looks like Theorem 2 has already been shown in \"Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision Problem in Nearly-Linear Running Time\u201d. There is a statement that \u201cChen & Wang (2016); Wang (2017) apply stochastic first-order algorithms (Nemirovski et al., 2009) for the one-step Lagrangian of the LP problem in reinforcement learning setting. However, as we discussed in Section 3, their algorithm is restricted to tabular parametrization\u201d. Is your Theorem 2 somehow an extension? Is Theorem 3 completely new?\\nThis is particularly called into question due to the lack of assumptions about the function class for value functions. It seems like the value function is required to be able to represent the true value function, which can be almost as restrictive as requiring tabular parameterizations (which can represent the true value function). This assumption seems to be used right at the bottom of Page 17, where U^{pi*} = V^*. Further, eta_v must be chosen to ensure that it does not affect (constrain) the optimal solution, which implies it might need to be very small. More about conditions on eta_v would be illuminating.\\xa0\\nThere is also one step in the theorem that I cannot verify. On Page 18, how is the squared removed for difference between U and Upi? The transition from the second line of the proof to the third line is not clear. It would also be good to more clearly state on page 14 how you get the first inequality, for || V^* ||_{2,mu}^2.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed.\\n1. It would have been better to also show the performance graphs with and without the improvements for multiple domains.\\n2. The central contribution is extending the single step LP to a multi-step formulation. It would be beneficial to empirically demonstrate how increasing k (the multi-step parameter) affects the performance gains.\\n3. Increasing k also comes at a computational cost. I would like to see some discussions on this and how long dual-AC takes to converge in comparison to the other algorithms tested (PPO and TRPO).\\n4. The authors concluded the presence of local convexity based on hessian inspection due to the use of path regularization. It was also mentioned that increasing the regularization parameter size increases the convergence rate. Empirically, how does changing the regularization parameter affect the performance in terms of reward maximization? In the experimental section of the appendix, it is mentioned that multiple regularization settings were tried but their performance is not mentioned. Also, for the regularization parameters that were tried, based on hessian inspection, did they all result in local convexity? A bit more discussion on these choices would be helpful.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMinor comments:\\n1. Page 2: In equation 5, there should not be a \\'ds\\' in the dual variable constraint\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nReview for a Paper where Leaning-to-Reject\\nThis paper introduces a variation on temporal difference learning for the function approximation case that attempts to resolve the issue of over-generalization across temporally-successive states. The new approach is applied to both linear and non-linear function approximation, and for prediction and control problems. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments in classic benchmark control domains (Mountain Car and Acrobot), and in Pong.\\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or practice, (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve (nor differentiates it from the usual problem of generalizing well), (3) the experiments are difficult to understand, missing many details, and generally do not support a significant contribution, and (4) the paper is imprecise and unpolished.\\nMain argument\\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that the problem it is trying to solve is a real thing. There is no experiment in this paper that clearly shows how this temporal generalization problem is different from the need to generalize well with function approximation. The paper points to references to establish the existence of the problem, but for example the Durugkar and Stone paper is a workshop paper and the conference version of that paper was rejected from ICLR 2018 and the reviewers highlighted serious issues with the paper\u2014that is not work to build upon. Further the paper under review here claims this problem is most pressing in the non-linear case, but the analysis in section 4.1 is for the linear case.\\xa0\\nThe resultant algorithm does not seem well justified, and has a different fixed point than TD, but there is no discussion of this other than section 4.4, which does not make clear statements about the correctness of the algorithm or what it converges to. Can you provide a proof or any kind of evidence that the proposed approach is sound, or how it\u2019s fixed point relates to TD?\\nThe experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches. There are so many missing details it is difficult to draw many conclusions:\\n\\nWhat was the policy used in exp1 for policy evaluation in MC?\\nWhy Fourier basis features?\\nIn MC with DQN how did you adjust the parameters and architecture for the MC task?\\nWas the reward in MC and Acrobot -1 per step or something else\\nHow did you tune the parameters in the MC and Acrobot experiments?\\nWhy so few runs in MC, none of the results presented are significant?\\nWhy is the performance so bad in MC?\\nDid you evaluate online learning or do tests with the greedy policy?\\nHow did you initialize the value functions and weights?\\nWhy did you use experience replay for the linear experiments?\\nIN MC and Acrobot why only a one layer MLP?\\n\\nIgnoring all that, the results are not convincing. Most of the results in the paper are not statistically significant. The policy evaluation results in MC show little difference to regular TD. The Pong results show DQN is actually better. This makes the reader wonder if the result with DQN on MC and Acrobot are only worse because you did not properly tune DQN for those domains, whereas the default DQN architecture is well tuned for Atari and that is why you method is competitive in the smaller domains.\\xa0\\nThe differences in the \u201caverage change in value plots\u201d are very small if the rewards are -1 per step. Can you provide some context to understand the significance of this difference? In the last experiment linear FA and MC, the step-size is set equal for all methods\u2014this is not a valid comparison. Your method may just work better with alpha = 0.1.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe paper has many imprecise parts, here are a few:\\n\\nThe definition of the value function would be approximate not equals unless you specify some properties of the function approximation architecture. Same for the Bellman equation\\nequation 1 of section 2.1 is neither an algorithm or a loss function\\nTD does not minimize the squared TD. Saying that is the objective function of TD learning in not true\\nend of section 2.1 says \u201cIt is computed as\u201d but the following equation just gives a form for the partial derivative\\nequation 2, x is not bounded\\xa0\\nYou state TC-loss has an unclear solution property, I don\u2019t know what that means and I don\u2019t think your approach is well justified either\\nSection 4.1 assumes linear FA, but its implied up until paragraph 2 that it has not assumed linear\\ntreatment of n_t in alg differs from appendix (t is no time episode number)\\nYour method has a n_t parameter that is adapted according to a schedule seemingly giving it an unfair advantage over DQN.\\nOver-claim not supported by the results: \u201cwe see that HR-TD is able to find a representation that is better at keeping the target value separate than TC is \u201c. The results do not show this.\\nSection 4.4 does not seem to go anywhere or produce and tangible conclusions\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to follow how the prox operator is used in the development of the alg, this could use some higher level explanation\\nIntro p2 is about bootstrapping, use that term and remove the equations\\nIt\u2019s not clear why you are talking about stochastic vs deterministic in P3\\nPerhaps you should compare against a MC method in the experiments to demonstrate the problem with TD methods and generalization\\nSection 2: \u201ccan often be a regularization term\u201d >> can or must be?\\nupdate law is an odd term\\n\\xa0tends to alleviate\u201d >> odd phrase\\nsection 4 should come before section 3\\nAlg 1 in not helpful because it just references an equation\\nsection 4.4 is very confusing, I cannot follow the logic of the statements\\xa0\\nQ learning >> Q-learning\\nNot sure what you mean with the last sentence of p2 section 5\\nwhere are the results for Acrobot linear function approximation\\nappendix Q-learning with linear FA is not DQN (table 2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFAQ for Reviewers\\nQ. The review I just submitted is not appearing! Did it go thru?\\nA. There seems to be some delay in the system for you to see your reviews. Just give a bit of time and refresh again.\\n\\xa0\\nQ. What is the borderline paper meeting between AC and reviewers about?\\nA. This year we require ACs to meet with reviewers for all borderline papers (defined and announced by PCs once all reviews are received). There will be one meeting per borderline paper. Once we receive all reviews, we will let ACs know which papers fall into this bucket. ACs will then schedule and run the meetings with the reviewers of the papers in question.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: What if I can not attend the meeting?\\nA: Please work with your AC to find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. Note that the discussion phase is roughly 1 month long, and overlaps with the NeurIPS conference, in case in-person meeting is preferred. All reviewers agreed to participate in review meetings when they accepted the reviewer invitations. An AC has right to\\xa0 downweight the review of reviewers who refuse to attend the meeting.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: How should I use supplementary material?\\nA: It is not necessary to read supplementary material but such material can often answer questions that arise while reading the main paper, so consider looking there before asking authors.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: How should I handle a policy violation?\\nA: To flag a CoE violation related to a submission, please indicate it when submitting the CoE report for that paper. The AC will work with the PC and the ethics board to resolve the case. To discuss other violations (e.g. plagiarism, double submission, paper length, formatting, etc.), please contact either the AC/SAC or the PC as appropriate. You can do this by sending a confidential comment with the appropriate readership restrictions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: Am I allowed to ask for additional experiments?\\nA: You can ask for additional experiments. New experiments should not significantly change the content of the submission. Rather, they should be limited in scope and serve to more thoroughly validate existing results from the submission.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nQ: If a submission does not achieve state-of-the-art results, is that grounds for rejection?\\nA: No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection. Submissions bring value to the ICLR community when they convincingly demonstrate new, relevant, impactful knowledge. Submissions can achieve this without achieving state-of-the-art results.\\nQ: Are authors expected to cite and compare with very recent work? What about non peer-reviewed (e.g., ArXiv) papers? (updated on 7 November 2022)\\nA: We consider papers contemporaneous if they are published (available in online proceedings) within the last four months. That means, since our full paper deadline is September 28, if a paper was published (i.e., at a peer-reviewed venue) on or after May 28, 2022, authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper. Authors are encouraged to cite and discuss all relevant papers, but they may be excused for not knowing about papers not published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals, which includes papers exclusively available on arXiv. Reviewers are encouraged to use their own good judgement and, if in doubt, discuss with their area chair.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Page Load\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        ICLR uses cookies for essential functions only.

While effective for global representation learning (e.g., image classification), this global objective doesn't explicitly enforce the learning of fine-grained, localized features crucial for tasks like object detection and segmentation.\\n    *   **RC-MAE:** Introduces an *explicit conditioning* mechanism. It reconstructs masked patches not just from visible patches, but also by concatenating *region-specific features* (e.g., RoI-pooled features from a pre-trained RPN or a teacher model) into the MAE decoder. This forces the decoder to learn to produce output *conditioned on specific regions*, thus promoting the learning of strong local representations. This is a clever and previously unexplored way to inject task-relevant inductive biases into a generative pre-training framework.\\n\\n2.  **Integration of Region-Level Information during Pre-training:**\\n    *   While region-of-interest (RoI) pooling and region proposals are standard in downstream detection/segmentation tasks, RC-MAE *integrates this concept directly into the self-supervised pre-training objective*. Most SSL methods learn general-purpose features, and region awareness only comes during fine-tuning. RC-MAE bakes this in from the start, a novel approach for MAE-like architectures.\\n\\n3.  **Hybrid Architecture/Objective:**\\n    *   It effectively creates a hybrid: a generative reconstruction task *guided by a discriminative or region-focused signal*.

If successful, it could establish MAE as a strong, unified backbone for *both* classification and dense prediction.\\n\\n2.  **Rethinking Inductive Biases in SSL:** It highlights the importance of incorporating task-specific inductive biases even in general-purpose self-supervised pre-training. While \\\"general-purpose\\\" is ideal, RC-MAE suggests that for optimal downstream performance on specific task families (like dense prediction), some form of task-aware pre-training might be necessary or highly beneficial. This opens avenues for research into how to best inject such biases without sacrificing generality.\\n\\n3.  **Advancing Foundation Models for Vision:** As large-scale vision models move towards \\\"foundation models\\\" capable of diverse downstream tasks, RC-MAE offers a methodology to create backbones that are robust not just for high-level recognition but also for fine-grained localization.

Since no specific paper or approach has been provided, I will outline the *criteria* and *common considerations* for evaluating a hypothetical paper on Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Masked Autoencoders (MAEs), assuming it aims for strong performance across multiple vision tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Evaluation Framework: Vision Transformers & Masked Autoencoders**\\n\\n**I. Technical Soundness of the Approach**\\n\\n*   **Core Idea and Novelty:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Does the paper introduce a genuinely novel masking strategy (e.g., adaptive, semantic, hierarchical), a new reconstruction target (e.g., beyond raw pixels, using feature maps, VQ-VAE latents, or perceptual losses), an improved decoder architecture, or a refined training objective? Is there a clear theoretical motivation for the proposed changes?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the novelty incremental without substantial gain? Does the proposed method add unnecessary complexity? Are there clear architectural or algorithmic reasons why it should perform better than existing MAE variants (e.g., original MAE, BEiT, SimMIM, Data2vec, etc.)? For instance, if a new masking strategy is proposed, is there justification for why it's superior to simple random patch masking?\\n\\n*   **Masking Strategy and Ratio:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Is the choice of masking ratio (e.g., ~75% for ViT-B/L/H) justified and empirically validated? If a different masking strategy is used (e.g., block-wise, attention-guided), is its effectiveness thoroughly demonstrated, and does it contribute to better learned representations?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the masking strategy well-suited for the specific ViT architecture (e.g., patch-based vs. Swin/hierarchical transformers)? Are the implications of very high masking ratios (e.g., forcing reliance on context) or very low ratios (less efficient self-supervision) discussed and ablated?\\n\\n*   **Reconstruction Target and Decoder Design:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Is the choice of reconstruction target (e.g., raw pixels, normalized pixels, HOG features, tokenizer IDs) appropriate for the problem and validated through ablations? Is the decoder lightweight (as in original MAE) yet effective, or is there a justification for a heavier decoder if one is used (e.g., for finer-grained reconstruction or specific feature learning)? Does the decoder design allow for efficient inference post-pretraining?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Does a complex reconstruction target lead to instability or require excessive compute? Does a heavy decoder negate the efficiency gains of the MAE paradigm? Are there issues with handling high-frequency details in reconstruction?\\n\\n*   **Encoder Architecture:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Is the choice of ViT backbone (e.g., vanilla ViT, Swin Transformer, Hiera, ConvNeXt) justified? Does the approach effectively leverage the architectural properties of the chosen encoder?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the method highly specialized for a particular ViT variant, potentially limiting its generalizability? Are the scaling properties of the method explored across different model sizes?\\n\\n**II. Experimental Setup**\\n\\n*   **Pre-training Data and Protocols:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Use of standard large-scale datasets (ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-22K, JFT-300M, LAION, etc.). Sufficient pre-training epochs (e.g., 800-1600 for ViT-L/H). Standard optimization schedules (AdamW, cosine decay, large batch sizes). Clear augmentation policies for self-supervised learning.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the pre-training dataset scale and diversity sufficient to draw strong conclusions? Are the pre-training epochs comparable to or longer than strong baselines? Are crucial hyperparameters (learning rate, weight decay, batch size) properly tuned and reported? Is the pre-training compute budget transparent and justifiable compared to baselines?\\n\\n*   **Downstream Task Evaluation:**\\n    *   **Image Classification:**\\n        *   **Strengths:** Evaluation on ImageNet-1K (linear probing and full fine-tuning). Use of standard fine-tuning recipes (e.g., 100 epochs, 300 epochs for competitive results). Evaluation on multiple model scales (ViT-B, L, H, G).\\n        *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is linear probing sufficient for assessing representation quality, or is full fine-tuning essential? Are the fine-tuning protocols (data augmentation, regularization, optimizer, learning rate schedule) identical across models for fair comparison? Are results reported for the same image resolution?\\n    *   **Object Detection & Instance Segmentation:**\\n        *   **Strengths:** Evaluation on COCO dataset (minival or test-dev). Use of standard frameworks (e.g., Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, DETR) with standard backbones. Reporting of comprehensive metrics (mAP, AP50, AP75, APs, APm, APl).\\n        *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the detection heads fine-tuned from scratch or initialized? Are the schedules (1x, 3x) and image scales consistent? Is the pre-trained backbone frozen or fine-tuned during detection? Are comparisons made against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines using the *same* detection framework?\\n    *   **Semantic Segmentation:**\\n        *   **Strengths:** Evaluation on ADE20K. Use of standard frameworks (e.g., UperNet, Semantic FPN, Mask2Former). Reporting of mIoU.\\n        *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Similar to detection, are the fine-tuning protocols consistent? Are comparisons against relevant baselines performed fairly?\\n\\n*   **Baselines:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Comparison against strong supervised baselines (e.g., ImageNet-22K pre-trained models). Comparison against leading self-supervised methods (e.g., MoCo v3, DINO, BEiT, SimMIM, Data2vec, EsViT, M-JEPA, etc.) from *reputable sources* (either re-run or cited with equivalent settings).\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the baselines truly state-of-the-art? Are the baseline results quoted from other papers run under strictly comparable conditions (pre-training epochs, model sizes, fine-tuning recipes)? Is there a tendency to compare against older or less competitive baselines to inflate performance claims?\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Comprehensive ablations on key components: masking ratio, reconstruction target, decoder depth/width, loss function components, pre-training epochs, augmentation strategies, optimizer choice. Clear analysis of how each component contributes to the final performance.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the ablations deep enough to truly understand the contribution of each design choice? Are crucial hyperparameters fully explored? Are the trends consistent across different model scales?\\n\\n**III. Results and Significance**\\n\\n*   **Quantitative Results:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) or highly competitive performance across multiple tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) and model scales. Significant improvements over strong baselines, especially under challenging settings (e.g., few-shot, transfer learning). Consistent gains across different fine-tuning protocols (linear probing vs. full fine-tuning).\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the reported gain statistically significant, or just marginal? Is the SOTA achieved by a large margin or only by a fraction of a percent? Are the results consistent, or are there specific scenarios where the method underperforms? Are the efficiency gains (if any) quantified (e.g., faster pre-training, less memory, faster inference)?\\n\\n*   **Qualitative Results:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Visualizations of reconstructed images (showing fidelity and meaningfulness). Attention maps or saliency maps demonstrating where the model focuses. Feature space visualizations (e.g., t-SNE) showing well-separated classes or semantic clusters.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the qualitative results genuinely insightful, or just illustrative? Do they confirm the claims made about the learned representations?\\n\\n*   **Analysis and Insights:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Does the paper provide novel insights into the MAE mechanism, ViT behavior, or self-supervised learning in general? Are there clear takeaways about what aspects of the design are most critical for performance?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the analysis superficial? Do the conclusions drawn from the results truly justify the claims? Does the paper contribute to the fundamental understanding of these models, or is it purely empirical?\\n\\n*   **Robustness and Generalization:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Demonstrating robustness to adversarial attacks, common corruptions (ImageNet-C), or out-of-distribution data. Good performance on transfer learning to diverse datasets.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the robustness merely coincidental or a direct result of the proposed method? Are these aspects thoroughly evaluated?\\n\\n**IV. Validity of Experiments**\\n\\n*   **Reproducibility:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Sufficient details provided for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. Clear hyperparameter settings. Availability of code (highly recommended).\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are critical details missing (e.g., specific data augmentation parameters, learning rate schedules, optimizer hyperparameters)? Is it feasible for an independent researcher to reproduce the results given the information?\\n\\n*   **Fair Comparisons:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** All comparisons are made with consistent backbone architectures, pre-training data scales, and fine-tuning protocols. Baselines are strong and run by the authors or sourced from highly reputable, consistent benchmarks.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are different pre-training epochs, model sizes, or fine-tuning schedules used for different models in a comparison table, making direct comparison unfair? Are the reported baseline numbers selectively chosen?\\n\\n*   **Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Results are averaged over multiple runs (if variability is high). Confidence intervals or standard deviations are reported.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are differences purely due to random chance or genuinely significant? Are the experiments sufficiently controlled to isolate the effect of the proposed changes?\\n\\n**V. Significance of the Results**\\n\\n*   **Impact on the Field:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Does the work open new research directions? Does it simplify existing approaches?

Technical Soundness of the Approach**\\n\\n*   **Core Idea and Novelty:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Does the paper introduce a genuinely novel masking strategy (e.g., adaptive, semantic, hierarchical), a new reconstruction target (e.g., beyond raw pixels, using feature maps, VQ-VAE latents, or perceptual losses), an improved decoder architecture, or a refined training objective? Is there a clear theoretical motivation for the proposed changes?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the novelty incremental without substantial gain? Does the proposed method add unnecessary complexity? Are there clear architectural or algorithmic reasons why it should perform better than existing MAE variants (e.g., original MAE, BEiT, SimMIM, Data2vec, etc.)? For instance, if a new masking strategy is proposed, is there justification for why it's superior to simple random patch masking?\\n\\n*   **Masking Strategy and Ratio:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Is the choice of masking ratio (e.g., ~75% for ViT-B/L/H) justified and empirically validated? If a different masking strategy is used (e.g., block-wise, attention-guided), is its effectiveness thoroughly demonstrated, and does it contribute to better learned representations?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the masking strategy well-suited for the specific ViT architecture (e.g., patch-based vs. Swin/hierarchical transformers)? Are the implications of very high masking ratios (e.g., forcing reliance on context) or very low ratios (less efficient self-supervision) discussed and ablated?\\n\\n*   **Reconstruction Target and Decoder Design:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Is the choice of reconstruction target (e.g., raw pixels, normalized pixels, HOG features, tokenizer IDs) appropriate for the problem and validated through ablations? Is the decoder lightweight (as in original MAE) yet effective, or is there a justification for a heavier decoder if one is used (e.g., for finer-grained reconstruction or specific feature learning)? Does the decoder design allow for efficient inference post-pretraining?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Does a complex reconstruction target lead to instability or require excessive compute? Does a heavy decoder negate the efficiency gains of the MAE paradigm? Are there issues with handling high-frequency details in reconstruction?\\n\\n*   **Encoder Architecture:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Is the choice of ViT backbone (e.g., vanilla ViT, Swin Transformer, Hiera, ConvNeXt) justified? Does the approach effectively leverage the architectural properties of the chosen encoder?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the method highly specialized for a particular ViT variant, potentially limiting its generalizability? Are the scaling properties of the method explored across different model sizes?\\n\\n**II.

Clear augmentation policies for self-supervised learning.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the pre-training dataset scale and diversity sufficient to draw strong conclusions? Are the pre-training epochs comparable to or longer than strong baselines? Are crucial hyperparameters (learning rate, weight decay, batch size) properly tuned and reported? Is the pre-training compute budget transparent and justifiable compared to baselines?\\n\\n*   **Downstream Task Evaluation:**\\n    *   **Image Classification:**\\n        *   **Strengths:** Evaluation on ImageNet-1K (linear probing and full fine-tuning). Use of standard fine-tuning recipes (e.g., 100 epochs, 300 epochs for competitive results). Evaluation on multiple model scales (ViT-B, L, H, G).\\n        *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is linear probing sufficient for assessing representation quality, or is full fine-tuning essential? Are the fine-tuning protocols (data augmentation, regularization, optimizer, learning rate schedule) identical across models for fair comparison? Are results reported for the same image resolution?\\n    *   **Object Detection & Instance Segmentation:**\\n        *   **Strengths:** Evaluation on COCO dataset (minival or test-dev). Use of standard frameworks (e.g., Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, DETR) with standard backbones. Reporting of comprehensive metrics (mAP, AP50, AP75, APs, APm, APl).\\n        *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the detection heads fine-tuned from scratch or initialized? Are the schedules (1x, 3x) and image scales consistent? Is the pre-trained backbone frozen or fine-tuned during detection? Are comparisons made against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines using the *same* detection framework?\\n    *   **Semantic Segmentation:**\\n        *   **Strengths:** Evaluation on ADE20K. Use of standard frameworks (e.g., UperNet, Semantic FPN, Mask2Former). Reporting of mIoU.\\n        *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Similar to detection, are the fine-tuning protocols consistent? Are comparisons against relevant baselines performed fairly?\\n\\n*   **Baselines:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Comparison against strong supervised baselines (e.g., ImageNet-22K pre-trained models). Comparison against leading self-supervised methods (e.g., MoCo v3, DINO, BEiT, SimMIM, Data2vec, EsViT, M-JEPA, etc.) from *reputable sources* (either re-run or cited with equivalent settings).\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the baselines truly state-of-the-art? Are the baseline results quoted from other papers run under strictly comparable conditions (pre-training epochs, model sizes, fine-tuning recipes)? Is there a tendency to compare against older or less competitive baselines to inflate performance claims?\\n\\n*   **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Comprehensive ablations on key components: masking ratio, reconstruction target, decoder depth/width, loss function components, pre-training epochs, augmentation strategies, optimizer choice. Clear analysis of how each component contributes to the final performance.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the ablations deep enough to truly understand the contribution of each design choice? Are crucial hyperparameters fully explored? Are the trends consistent across different model scales?\\n\\n**III. Results and Significance**\\n\\n*   **Quantitative Results:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) or highly competitive performance across multiple tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) and model scales. Significant improvements over strong baselines, especially under challenging settings (e.g., few-shot, transfer learning). Consistent gains across different fine-tuning protocols (linear probing vs. full fine-tuning).\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the reported gain statistically significant, or just marginal? Is the SOTA achieved by a large margin or only by a fraction of a percent? Are the results consistent, or are there specific scenarios where the method underperforms? Are the efficiency gains (if any) quantified (e.g., faster pre-training, less memory, faster inference)?\\n\\n*   **Qualitative Results:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Visualizations of reconstructed images (showing fidelity and meaningfulness). Attention maps or saliency maps demonstrating where the model focuses. Feature space visualizations (e.g., t-SNE) showing well-separated classes or semantic clusters.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are the qualitative results genuinely insightful, or just illustrative? Do they confirm the claims made about the learned representations?\\n\\n*   **Analysis and Insights:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Does the paper provide novel insights into the MAE mechanism, ViT behavior, or self-supervised learning in general? Are there clear takeaways about what aspects of the design are most critical for performance?\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the analysis superficial? Do the conclusions drawn from the results truly justify the claims? Does the paper contribute to the fundamental understanding of these models, or is it purely empirical?\\n\\n*   **Robustness and Generalization:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Demonstrating robustness to adversarial attacks, common corruptions (ImageNet-C), or out-of-distribution data. Good performance on transfer learning to diverse datasets.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Is the robustness merely coincidental or a direct result of the proposed method? Are these aspects thoroughly evaluated?\\n\\n**IV. Validity of Experiments**\\n\\n*   **Reproducibility:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Sufficient details provided for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. Clear hyperparameter settings. Availability of code (highly recommended).\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are critical details missing (e.g., specific data augmentation parameters, learning rate schedules, optimizer hyperparameters)? Is it feasible for an independent researcher to reproduce the results given the information?\\n\\n*   **Fair Comparisons:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** All comparisons are made with consistent backbone architectures, pre-training data scales, and fine-tuning protocols. Baselines are strong and run by the authors or sourced from highly reputable, consistent benchmarks.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are different pre-training epochs, model sizes, or fine-tuning schedules used for different models in a comparison table, making direct comparison unfair? Are the reported baseline numbers selectively chosen?\\n\\n*   **Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   **Strengths:** Results are averaged over multiple runs (if variability is high). Confidence intervals or standard deviations are reported.\\n    *   **Questions/Weaknesses:** Are differences purely due to random chance or genuinely significant? Are the experiments sufficiently controlled to isolate the effect of the proposed changes?\\n\\n**V.

This \\\"teacher\\\" aims to accelerate convergence, improve solution quality (e.g., finding better global optima), or enhance the robustness of the optimization process.\\n\\nLet's break down the assessment based on common interpretations of such a role:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Theoretical Analysis of the Teacher's Role\\n\\nThe theoretical analysis of a \\\"teacher's role\\\" in optimization usually falls into several categories, each with its own conceptual framework:\\n\\n*   **Curriculum Learning / Progressive Training:** The \\\"teacher\\\" sequences data or problem instances from simpler to more complex ones.\\n    *   **Theoretical Basis:** Often framed within statistical learning theory. The teacher's role is to construct a sequence of loss functions or data distributions that guide the learner. This can be viewed as an adaptive regularization or a path-following method in a high-dimensional space.\\n    *   **Mathematical Tools:** Control theory, dynamical systems, optimal control (where the teacher's policy is optimized), convex optimization (for simpler cases of curriculum design).\\n*   **Expert Guidance / Oracle with Partial Information:** The \\\"teacher\\\" provides hints, demonstrations, or corrections during the optimization process.\\n    *   **Theoretical Basis:** Often draws from online learning, imitation learning, interactive optimization, or game theory. The teacher might be a human expert, a pre-trained model, or another algorithm.\\n    *   **Mathematical Tools:** Regret analysis (for online learning), optimal transport (for mapping expert trajectories), information theory (quantifying the value of hints), multi-armed bandits (for selecting advice).\\n*   **Adaptive Hyperparameter Optimization (Meta-Learning):** The \\\"teacher\\\" learns to adjust the optimizer's hyperparameters (learning rates, momentum, regularization strengths) based on the optimization trajectory.\\n    *   **Theoretical Basis:** Bilevel optimization, reinforcement learning (where the optimizer is the agent and the teacher provides rewards/guidance), gradient-based meta-learning.\\n    *   **Mathematical Tools:** Higher-order differentiation, non-convex optimization, stochastic approximation.\\n*   **Auxiliary Objectives / Regularization:** The \\\"teacher\\\" provides additional signals or constraints that help shape the optimization landscape, guiding the search towards desired properties beyond just minimizing the primary objective.\\n    *   **Theoretical Basis:** Regularization theory, multi-objective optimization, constraint satisfaction.\\n    *   **Mathematical Tools:** Lagrangian methods, penalty methods, specific regularization terms (e.g., for sparsity, smoothness, diversity).\\n\\n**Overall Analysis:** The theoretical analysis often models the \\\"teacher\\\" as a function or policy that maps the current state of the optimizer (e.g., current solution, gradient, loss history) to an action (e.g., providing a new data point, adjusting a hyperparameter, giving a directional hint). The core challenge is to formally define the teacher's *knowledge* or *strategy* and how it interacts with the *learner* (the optimizer).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Validity of the Claims\\n\\nThe claims often made regarding the teacher's role include:\\n\\n*   **Faster Convergence:** The teacher can guide the optimizer more directly towards the optimum, avoiding unproductive regions.\\n*   **Improved Global Optima Discovery:** For non-convex problems, a teacher can help escape local minima by providing global insights or by structuring the search.\\n*   **Enhanced Generalization (in ML contexts):** Especially true for curriculum learning, where presenting data in a meaningful order can lead to models that generalize better to unseen data.\\n*   **Robustness to Noise/Adversarial Conditions:** A teacher could provide corrective feedback or robust training examples.\\n*   **Reduced Computational Cost:** By providing intelligent guidance, the teacher might reduce the number of expensive objective function evaluations.\\n\\n**Validity Assessment:**\\nThe claims are generally **theoretically valid under specific assumptions** about the teacher's capabilities and the nature of the optimization problem.\\n\\n*   **If the teacher has perfect or near-perfect knowledge:** For instance, if a teacher can always identify the globally optimal direction or sequence data perfectly, then improved performance is almost guaranteed. However, such a teacher is often a theoretical construct.\\n*   **If the teacher's information is strategically optimal:** For example, in curriculum learning, if the curriculum is truly optimal (i.e., designed to maximize learning efficiency), then the claims hold. Proving optimality for a general curriculum is extremely difficult.\\n*   **Empirical evidence:** Many empirical studies in machine learning (e.g., curriculum learning, meta-learning frameworks) support these claims in practice, suggesting that the underlying theoretical principles are sound.\\n\\n**Caveats to Validity:**\\n*   **Cost of Teacher Information:** The claims usually don't account for the computational or human cost of generating the teacher's information. A highly effective teacher might be prohibitively expensive to create or simulate.\\n*   **Teacher Error/Bias:** If the teacher provides noisy, incorrect, or biased information, the optimization process can be hindered or even diverge. The robustness of the optimizer to teacher errors is a critical theoretical concern.\\n*   **Generalizability of Teacher Strategy:** A teacher optimized for one problem might not be effective for another, limiting the general applicability of a specific teacher strategy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Rigor of the Proofs\\n\\nThe rigor of proofs concerning the teacher's role varies significantly depending on the specific model of the teacher and the type of problem:\\n\\n*   **Strongest Rigor:**\\n    *   **For well-defined oracle models:** If the \\\"teacher\\\" is modeled as an oracle providing, for example, the exact subgradient of a regularizer or a perfectly ordered curriculum for a convex problem, then proofs of convergence rates (e.g., linear, sublinear) are often highly rigorous, relying on standard convex optimization theory, online learning theory (e.g., regret bounds), or control theory. These proofs typically involve Lyapunov functions, contraction mappings, or carefully constructed potential functions.\\n    *   **In specific, simplified settings:** Proofs demonstrating benefits of curriculum learning often hold for specific, simple function classes (e.g., linear models, certain neural network architectures) or under strong assumptions about data separability and teacher knowledge.\\n\\n*   **Moderate Rigor:**\\n    *   **For adaptive hyperparameter optimization:** Proofs often involve stochastic approximation, non-convex optimization theory, and rely on assumptions about the smoothness of the meta-loss landscape. These can be complex due to the nested optimization structure.\\n    *   **Game-theoretic teacher models:** Proofs of equilibrium existence or convergence to Nash equilibria are common.\\n\\n*   **Challenges to Rigor:**\\n    *   **Defining \\\"Optimal Teacher\\\":** Proving the existence or construction of an *optimal* teacher for a general non-convex optimization problem is often intractable. Instead, researchers usually prove that *if* a teacher provides certain types of information (e.g., information satisfying specific Lipschitz conditions or bounds on error), *then* the optimizer benefits in a quantifiable way.\\n    *   **Modeling Imperfect Teachers:** Proving robustness to noisy or adversarial teacher inputs significantly increases complexity and often requires stronger assumptions or leads to weaker guarantees.\\n    *   **Computational Cost of Teacher:** Most theoretical proofs focus on the *information content* and its impact on convergence, often abstracting away the computational cost of generating that information. Proofs that simultaneously optimize performance and teacher cost are rarer but highly valuable.\\n    *   **Generality vs. Specificity:** To achieve high rigor, proofs often make very specific assumptions about the teacher's mechanism or the problem structure, which can limit their practical applicability.\\n\\n**Overall:** The proofs are rigorous *within their defined assumptions*. The challenge is often that these assumptions are strong or that modeling a \\\"realistic\\\" teacher (e.g., a human expert, a complex meta-learning algorithm) leads to highly intractable mathematical problems, necessitating more empirical validation than formal proof.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Generality of the Conclusions\\n\\nThe generality of the conclusions is highly dependent on the specific model of the teacher:\\n\\n*   **High Generality:**\\n    *   **Abstract Information Theory:** Conclusions about the *value of information* in reducing uncertainty in a search space can be quite general, applying to any optimization problem. However, translating this into concrete algorithmic steps is hard.\\n    *   **General Principles:** Concepts like \\\"gradual learning\\\" (curriculum learning) or \\\"adaptive control\\\" are generalizable principles that can be applied to various optimization and learning problems (e.g., training deep neural networks, robot locomotion, solving PDEs).\\n\\n*   **Moderate Generality:**\\n    *   **Meta-learning frameworks:** While the specific meta-optimizer might be problem-dependent, the idea of learning an update rule or a hyperparameter schedule is quite general across different machine learning tasks.\\n    *   **Interactive/Human-in-the-loop optimization:** The conceptual framework of integrating human feedback is general, but the specific implementation and the type of effective feedback will vary greatly by domain.\\n\\n*   **Low Generality / Domain-Specific:**\\n    *   **Highly specialized teacher policies:** If the teacher is designed for a very specific problem structure (e.g., a convex quadratic program with sparse solutions), its \\\"teaching\\\" strategy might not generalize to other problems (e.g., non-convex, non-sparse).\\n    *   **Teacher trained on specific datasets:** A meta-learning teacher trained on one distribution of tasks might perform poorly on another.\\n\\n**Overall:** While the *concept* of a teacher enhancing optimization is broadly applicable, the *specific methods* by which a teacher provides useful information, and the proven benefits thereof, are often highly dependent on the problem domain, the nature of the information, and the computational budget for the teacher. The \\\"no free lunch\\\" theorem still applies: a teacher beneficial for one class of problems might be detrimental or irrelevant for another.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Potential Impact on Optimization Methods\\n\\nThe findings related to the teacher's role have a significant and growing impact on optimization methods, particularly in machine learning:\\n\\n*   **New Algorithmic Paradigms:**\\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Has become a standard technique in NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning to stabilize training and improve performance (e.g., self-paced learning, pre-training with simpler tasks).\\n    *   **Meta-Optimization / Learning to Optimize:** This has led to the development of optimizers that are themselves learned, showing promise in outperforming hand-designed optimizers on certain tasks, and enabling faster convergence and better generalization.\\n    *   **Imitation Learning / Learning from Demonstrations:** Allows complex behaviors or optimization strategies to be learned directly from expert examples, particularly useful in robotics and control.\\n*   **Enhanced Problem Solving:**\\n    *   **Tackling Non-Convexity:** Teachers can provide insights that help global optimization algorithms escape local minima or navigate complex landscapes more effectively.\\n    *   **High-Dimensional Optimization:** By providing structured guidance, teachers can alleviate the curse of dimensionality, focusing search on relevant subspaces.\\n    *   **Resource-Constrained Optimization:** Intelligent teacher guidance can reduce the number of expensive function evaluations or simulations needed.\\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Optimization:** Provides a theoretical framework for incorporating human expertise and intuition directly into automated optimization processes, blending human intelligence with algorithmic power. This is crucial for problems where objective functions are hard to define or evaluate automatically.\\n*   **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):** The \\\"teacher\\\" concept aligns well with AutoML initiatives, where systems learn to design, train, and deploy machine learning models with minimal human intervention. Learning optimal hyperparameter schedules or architectural search strategies are direct applications.\\n*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Understanding *how* a teacher guides an optimizer can provide insights into the underlying structure of the problem or the strategy of an expert.\\n\\nIn essence, the \\\"teacher\\\" paradigm represents a move beyond purely reactive optimization (where the optimizer only responds to local gradients) towards more proactive, informed, and adaptive strategies. It signifies a shift from optimizing *for* a problem to optimizing *how to optimize*.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe theoretical analysis of the \\\"teacher's role\\\" in optimization is a vibrant and critical area of research. The claims of accelerated convergence, improved solution quality, and enhanced generalization are theoretically valid under specific, often strong, assumptions about the teacher's knowledge and capabilities. The rigor of proofs varies, being strongest for well-defined oracle models and becoming more challenging for complex, realistic teacher interactions (e.g., noisy information, computationally expensive guidance).\\n\\nWhile the generality of conclusions can be limited by the specificity of the teacher model, the overarching principles (e.g., curriculum design, meta-learning, expert guidance) are highly generalizable and have already spurred significant advancements in optimization methods, particularly in the realm of machine learning. The primary challenge remains in bridging the gap between theoretical constructs of an ideal teacher and the practical realities of generating useful, affordable, and robust teaching signals in complex, real-world scenarios. The future impact lies in developing more sophisticated, data-driven, and robust teacher models that can effectively guide optimizers across a broader spectrum of challenging problems.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.93754435\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Assess the theoretical analysis of the teacher's role, the validity of the claims, and the potential impact of the findings on optimization methods.

Rigor of the Proofs\\n\\nThe rigor of proofs concerning the teacher\\'s role varies significantly depending on the specific model of the teacher and the type of problem:\\n\\n*   **Strongest Rigor:**\\n    *   **For well-defined oracle models:** If the \"teacher\" is modeled as an oracle providing, for example, the exact subgradient of a regularizer or a perfectly ordered curriculum for a convex problem, then proofs of convergence rates (e.g., linear, sublinear) are often highly rigorous, relying on standard convex optimization theory, online learning theory (e.g., regret bounds), or control theory. These proofs typically involve Lyapunov functions, contraction mappings, or carefully constructed potential functions.\\n    *   **In specific, simplified settings:** Proofs demonstrating benefits of curriculum learning often hold for specific, simple function classes (e.g., linear models, certain neural network architectures) or under strong assumptions about data separability and teacher knowledge.\\n\\n*   **Moderate Rigor:**\\n    *   **For adaptive hyperparameter optimization:** Proofs often involve stochastic approximation, non-convex optimization theory, and rely on assumptions about the smoothness of the meta-loss landscape. These can be complex due to the nested optimization structure.\\n    *   **Game-theoretic teacher models:** Proofs of equilibrium existence or convergence to Nash equilibria are common.\\n\\n*   **Challenges to Rigor:**\\n    *   **Defining \"Optimal Teacher\":** Proving the existence or construction of an *optimal* teacher for a general non-convex optimization problem is often intractable. Instead, researchers usually prove that *if* a teacher provides certain types of information (e.g., information satisfying specific Lipschitz conditions or bounds on error), *then* the optimizer benefits in a quantifiable way.\\n    *   **Modeling Imperfect Teachers:** Proving robustness to noisy or adversarial teacher inputs significantly increases complexity and often requires stronger assumptions or leads to weaker guarantees.\\n    *   **Computational Cost of Teacher:** Most theoretical proofs focus on the *information content* and its impact on convergence, often abstracting away the computational cost of generating that information. Proofs that simultaneously optimize performance and teacher cost are rarer but highly valuable.\\n    *   **Generality vs. Specificity:** To achieve high rigor, proofs often make very specific assumptions about the teacher\\'s mechanism or the problem structure, which can limit their practical applicability.\\n\\n**Overall:** The proofs are rigorous *within their defined assumptions*. The challenge is often that these assumptions are strong or that modeling a \"realistic\" teacher (e.g., a human expert, a complex meta-learning algorithm) leads to highly intractable mathematical problems, necessitating more empirical validation than formal proof.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Generality of the Conclusions\\n\\nThe generality of the conclusions is highly dependent on the specific model of the teacher:\\n\\n*   **High Generality:**\\n    *   **Abstract Information Theory:** Conclusions about the *value of information* in reducing uncertainty in a search space can be quite general, applying to any optimization problem. However, translating this into concrete algorithmic steps is hard.\\n    *   **General Principles:** Concepts like \"gradual learning\" (curriculum learning) or \"adaptive control\" are generalizable principles that can be applied to various optimization and learning problems (e.g., training deep neural networks, robot locomotion, solving PDEs).\\n\\n*   **Moderate Generality:**\\n    *   **Meta-learning frameworks:** While the specific meta-optimizer might be problem-dependent, the idea of learning an update rule or a hyperparameter schedule is quite general across different machine learning tasks.\\n    *   **Interactive/Human-in-the-loop optimization:** The conceptual framework of integrating human feedback is general, but the specific implementation and the type of effective feedback will vary greatly by domain.\\n\\n*   **Low Generality / Domain-Specific:**\\n    *   **Highly specialized teacher policies:** If the teacher is designed for a very specific problem structure (e.g., a convex quadratic program with sparse solutions), its \"teaching\" strategy might not generalize to other problems (e.g., non-convex, non-sparse).\\n    *   **Teacher trained on specific datasets:** A meta-learning teacher trained on one distribution of tasks might perform poorly on another.\\n\\n**Overall:** While the *concept* of a teacher enhancing optimization is broadly applicable, the *specific methods* by which a teacher provides useful information, and the proven benefits thereof, are often highly dependent on the problem domain, the nature of the information, and the computational budget for the teacher. The \"no free lunch\" theorem still applies: a teacher beneficial for one class of problems might be detrimental or irrelevant for another.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Potential Impact on Optimization Methods\\n\\nThe findings related to the teacher\\'s role have a significant and growing impact on optimization methods, particularly in machine learning:\\n\\n*   **New Algorithmic Paradigms:**\\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Has become a standard technique in NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning to stabilize training and improve performance (e.g., self-paced learning, pre-training with simpler tasks).\\n    *   **Meta-Optimization / Learning to Optimize:** This has led to the development of optimizers that are themselves learned, showing promise in outperforming hand-designed optimizers on certain tasks, and enabling faster convergence and better generalization.\\n    *   **Imitation Learning / Learning from Demonstrations:** Allows complex behaviors or optimization strategies to be learned directly from expert examples, particularly useful in robotics and control.\\n*   **Enhanced Problem Solving:**\\n    *   **Tackling Non-Convexity:** Teachers can provide insights that help global optimization algorithms escape local minima or navigate complex landscapes more effectively.\\n    *   **High-Dimensional Optimization:** By providing structured guidance, teachers can alleviate the curse of dimensionality, focusing search on relevant subspaces.\\n    *   **Resource-Constrained Optimization:** Intelligent teacher guidance can reduce the number of expensive function evaluations or simulations needed.\\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Optimization:** Provides a theoretical framework for incorporating human expertise and intuition directly into automated optimization processes, blending human intelligence with algorithmic power. This is crucial for problems where objective functions are hard to define or evaluate automatically.\\n*   **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):** The \"teacher\" concept aligns well with AutoML initiatives, where systems learn to design, train, and deploy machine learning models with minimal human intervention. Learning optimal hyperparameter schedules or architectural search strategies are direct applications.\\n*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Understanding *how* a teacher guides an optimizer can provide insights into the underlying structure of the problem or the strategy of an expert.\\n\\nIn essence, the \"teacher\" paradigm represents a move beyond purely reactive optimization (where the optimizer only responds to local gradients) towards more proactive, informed, and adaptive strategies. It signifies a shift from optimizing *for* a problem to optimizing *how to optimize*.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe theoretical analysis of the \"teacher\\'s role\" in optimization is a vibrant and critical area of research. The claims of accelerated convergence, improved solution quality, and enhanced generalization are theoretically valid under specific, often strong, assumptions about the teacher\\'s knowledge and capabilities. The rigor of proofs varies, being strongest for well-defined oracle models and becoming more challenging for complex, realistic teacher interactions (e.g., noisy information, computationally expensive guidance).\\n\\nWhile the generality of conclusions can be limited by the specificity of the teacher model, the overarching principles (e.g., curriculum design, meta-learning, expert guidance) are highly generalizable and have already spurred significant advancements in optimization methods, particularly in the realm of machine learning. The primary challenge remains in bridging the gap between theoretical constructs of an ideal teacher and the practical realities of generating useful, affordable, and robust teaching signals in complex, real-world scenarios. The future impact lies in developing more sophisticated, data-driven, and robust teacher models that can effectively guide optimizers across a broader spectrum of challenging problems.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.93754435}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have received the reviews from the three agents.
