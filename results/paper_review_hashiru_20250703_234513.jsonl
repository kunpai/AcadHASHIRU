The paper title is: Selection Collider Bias in Large Language Models\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: This paper investigates models trained to estimate the conditional distribution: P (Y |X,S), where S is the cause of sample selection bias in the training dataset. Selection bias is not an uncommon problem, as most datasets are subsampled representations of a larger population, yet few are sampled with randomization (Heckman, 1979). Sample selection bias occurs when some mechanism, observed or not, causes samples to be included or excluded from the dataset. Employing the language of causal inference, selection bias is distinct from both confounder and collider bias. Confounder bias can occur when two variables have a common cause, whereas collider bias can occur when two variables have a common effect. Correcting for confounding bias requires that one condition upon the common cause variable; conversely correcting for collider bias requires that one does not condition upon the common effect (Pearl, 2009). While sample selection bias can take many forms, the type of selection bias that interests us here is that which involves more than one variable (observed or not), whose common effect results in selection bias. Such relationships can be compactly represented as a causal model in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), for example illustrated in Figure 1. The absence of arrows connecting nodes in causal DAGs encode assumptions, for example that W and G in 1(a) are stochastically independent of one another. The direction of the arrowhead encodes our assumptions about the direction of causation. For example, two arrows departing from W and G toward S encode the assumption that S is a common effect of W and G. In Figure 1, the twice-encircled node, S, symbolizes some mechanism that can cause samples to be selected into the dataset. To capture the statistical pro- cess of sampling for dataset formation, one must condition on S, thus inducing the collider bias relationship between W and G in the causal model. We will use the term selection collider bias to refer to circumstances such as this one, when the selection bias mechanism induces a collider bias relationship in the dataset, that would not have been there otherwise. Beyond posing a risk to out-of-domain generalizability (Arjovsky et al., 2019), selection collider bias can result in models that lack even \u2018internal validity\u2019, as the associations learned from the data represent the statistical dependencies induced by the dataset formation and not the data itself (Griffith et al., 2020). 2 UNDERSPECIFICATION: The link between underspecification in machine learning, and the resulting spurious correlations and risks to out-of-domain generalization is investigated thoroughly in (D\u2019Amour et al., 2020). In this work, underspecification is defined in the context of having multiple predictors with equally low predictive risk (or some other risk minimization) scores. In the NLP setting, (Manning, 2011) provide an example of underspecification in a part-of-speech tagging task, in which a given sentence context makes it unclear whether the word, \u2018discontinued\u2019, should have the label \u2018adjective\u2019 or \u2018verbal participle\u2019. In this paper, we are interested in the underspecification that occurs when none of the features available to the model (at training or inference time) are causes of the label. With no causal features available, models must resort to learning any spurious associations that will reduce predictive risk, regardless of how tenuous the association may be. Thus, models trained with selection collider biased data are particularly vulnerable to learning statistical associations in underspecified learning tasks. A single prediction task may be partitioned into well-specified and underspecified \u2018sub\u2019-tasks. In the example from (Manning, 2011), we can assume a well-specified \u2018sub\u2019-task reduced the set of all possible prediction classes to the set containing just \u2018adjective\u2019 and \u2018verbal participle\u2019, while the underspecified \u2018sub\u2019-task must then determine which of the two remaining classes is correct. For much of this paper we will consider a similar scenario: where the well-specified portion of the masked language modeling (MLM) task may have correctly predicted that a gender pronoun should fill-in a masked-out word, however the \u2018sub\u2019-task of determining which gender pronoun to predict is underspecified. 3 PLAUSIBLE CAUSAL MODELS: Figure 1 shows plausible data-generating processes for the relevant features and labels in the abovementioned task of gender pronoun resolution. In Figure 1(a), the symbol X represents context sentences in our dataset, and Y represents the label, specifically a gender pronoun. The arrow pointing from X to Y encodes our assumption that X , is more likely to cause Y, rather than vice versa. For example, in a sentence about a father and daughter going to the park, the sentence context determines which gender pronoun is most appropriate. The remaining symbols in Figure 1(a) are not recorded in the dataset, but rather represent entities or mechanisms that may cause X or Y. The symbol G represents gender and causes both the context and gender pronoun. W represents various gender-neutral entities, such as time, place, or genderneutral hobbies, and is included in the causal DAG because it may be a cause of both X and S. Finally, the selection node, S, takes the value of S=1 for samples in the data and S=0 otherwise. In Figure 1, S is the common effect of W and G, and represents access to the dataset. The W \u2192 S \u2190 G relationship can represent any selection bias mechanism that has a gender dependency upon otherwise gender-neutral entities. For example, in data sources like Wikipedia written about people, it is plausible that access has become increasingly less gender dependent as the date approaches more modern times, but not evenly in every place. In data sources like Reddit written by people, W \u2192 S \u2190 G can plausibly capture the scenario that even in the case of subreddits about gender-neutral hobbies, the style of the moderation and community may result in gender-disparate access to a given subreddit. Now, in Figure 1(b), we can see the underspecified counterpart of the well-specified prediction task in Figure 1(a). As defined above, to achieve the underspecification of interest here, we must obscure any causal features from X . In the case of gender pronoun resolution, this is achieved by removing the path between gender and context. Further, because W is also gender-neutral, once we have removed any gender-identifying features from context, we should additionally remove the path between context and gender-pronouns, as there is no longer any feature of X causing Y. With the causal path from X \u2192 Y removed, had there been no backdoor path from X to Y, then we would then expect X and Y to be unconditionally independent in the real world (RW ). However, in the scenario depicted in Figure 1(b), selection collider bias has opened the backdoor path, X \u2190W \u2192 S \u2190 G\u2192 Y , Thus, the learned model (LM ) is encouraged to learn any spurious association along this path that reduces predictive risk, resulting in X and Y becoming unconditionally dependent. Formally, selection collider bias causes the transformation: (Y \u22a5\u22a5X)RW s\u21d2 (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5X)LM, due to even very weakly interacting spurious associations, such as those between gender and time. Whereas spurious associations learned in the well-specified model would be likely due to signals that are stronger than those along the causal path X \u2192 Y 1. 3.1 MASKED GENDER TASK: Beyond just claiming plausibility, we can evaluate measured data from LLMs to support our arguments for the causal relationships in Figure 1, after making two additional assumptions: For a given causal graph, Gr, and a measured probability distribution Pr, we are assuming 1) the Markov assumption: (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Gr =\u21d2 (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Pr and 2) faithfulness: (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Gr \u21d0= (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Pr, where Z is the set {W,G, S} (Peters et al., 2017). To obtain the measured probability distribution Pr, we developed the masked gender task (MGT), a special case of the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective, that uses a heuristic to build underspecified learning tasks by masking common gender-identifying words for prediction (see Appendix A), which we used to finetune two models. We use these finetuned models as comparison baselines against unmodified pre-trained BERT base and large (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa base and large (Liu et al., 2019) models, tested using our MGT evaluation set described in Table 1. We argue it is not implausible that during MLM pre-training, gender-identifying words are masked for prediction in otherwise gender-neutral sequences. Further, at inference time, the prediction of gender-identifying words or labels from gender-neutral text is common to many downstream tasks such as dialog generation, machine translation from genderless to more gendered languages, or any task requiring gendered predictions from gender-underspecified features. 4 SELECTION COLLIDER BIAS: Before sharing our LLM measurements, we further motivate the mechanisms behind selection collider bias. Revisiting Figure 1(a), to estimate the causal effect of X on Y here, we could the use back-door adjustment (Pearl, 2009), with an admissible set {G} to calculate: P (Y |do(X)) =\u2211 G P (Y |X,G)P (G). The observation of G in the dataset makes this a trivial problem to solve. 1One example of spurious associations learned despite a well-specified task is that of an image background (desert vs grass) providing a stronger signal than the animal foreground (camel vs cow) (Arjovsky et al., 2019). (a) Spurious correlation between gender and time plotted as averaged softmax probabilities for predicted gender pronouns vs a range of dates. (b) Spurious correlation between gender and place as list of countries, ordered by their Global Gender Gap rank (see Appendix B.1). Figure 2: Softmax probabilities for LLM predictions displaying spurious correlation between gender and gender-neutral entities injected into gender-neutral input texts described in Table 1 Although the S node is not explicitly recorded in the dataset, even if S were available to us, we would not condition on it, as this would induce collider bias between G and W in the form of S\u2019s structural equation (Pearl, 2009): S := fs(W,G,Us), where Us is the exogenous noise of the S variable. As mentioned above, to capture the statistical process of dataset formation, we implicitly condition on S = 1 for all the samples in the dataset. Now applying the above-mentioned Markov and faithfulness assumptions to the underspecified model in Figure 1(b), we can estimate the conditional probability of a gender-identifying word, Y, given gender-neutral text, X , in a LLM as shown in Equation (1) through Equation (4). P (Y |X) = P (Y |X,S=1) (1) \u223c P (G|X,S=1) (2) \u223c P (G|X,W ) (3) \u223c P (G|W ) (4) Equation (1) shows a mapping from the target unbiased quantity to the measured selection biased data, as defined in (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012). Equation (2) assumes very high correlation between the textual form of gender in Y (as a \u2018gender-identifying word\u2019) with the symbolic variable for gender, G. Equation (3) replaces S with the variables in its structural equation, S := fs(W,G,Us), which entails the conditional dependence P (G|W ) \u0338= P (G). Finally, Equation (4) assumes we have successfully achieved a gender-neutral text, X, and thus P (G|X) = P (G). Equation (1) - Equation (4) show that conditional probability P (Y |X) obtained by applying the underspecified task in Figure 1(b) to an LLM, should be distributed similarly to P (G|W ). This provides information about the latent representations for G and W, which are otherwise inaccessible. Additionally, these equations provide insights into the role of selection collider bias in the transformation from real-world (RW ) unconditional independence to learned model (LM ) unconditional dependence discussed in Section 3: (Y \u22a5\u22a5X)RW \u2248 (G \u22a5\u22a5W )RW s\u21d2 (G\u22a5\u0338\u22a5W )LM \u2248 (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5X)LM. 5 PRE-TRAINED LLMS G,W DEPENDENCY Figure 2(a) shows pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa base and large results, as well as results for models finetuned with the MGT objective2. Each plotted dot is the softmax probability (averaged over 60 gender-neutral texts) for the predicted gender pronouns vs year, where year in the x-axis matches that gender-neutral W value injected into the gender-neutral text3. 2The finetuned models serve as a rough upper limit for the magnitude of expected spurious correlations. 3For example, the purple and green dots at the x-axis position of W = 1938 are the softmax predictions for the masked word in input texts like \u2018In 1938, [MASK] will became a teenager.\u2019, for female and male pronouns. The shaded regions show the 95% confidence interval for the linear fit. Unlike the finetuned model\u2019s binary prediction, because the final layer in the pre-trained model is a softmax over the entire tokenizer\u2019s vocabulary, we sum the gender-identified portion (as listed in Table 3) of the probability mass from the top five predicted words4. We argue the spurious associations in Figure 2, between W along the x-axis and predicted gender, G, along the y-axis, supports our supports our hypothesis that selection collider bias has resulted in these LLMs learning P (Y |X) \u223c P (G|W ), for entities G and W that would be otherwise unconditionally independent. Figure 3 shows the slope and Pearson\u2019s r correlation coefficient (following (Rudinger et al., 2018)) of the y-axis value against the index of the x-axis, for all the plots in Figure 2. As expected, we see the slope and correlation coefficients highest in the finetuned models. We do nonetheless see comparable coefficients for the spurious W,G depen- dency in the unmodified pre-trained models, supporting our hypothesis that these models are learning from underspecified tasks such as that in Figure 1(b). 6 SELECTION BIAS RECOVERY: In (Bareinboim et al., 2014) it is proven that one can recover the unbiased conditional distribution P (Y |X) from a causal DAG, GS , with selection bias: P (Y |X,S =1), if and only if the selection mechanism can become conditionally independent of the effect, given the cause: (Y \u22a5\u22a5 S|X)GS . However, in Figure 1(b) we can see (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5 S|X) trivially, due to the lack of a direct path between X and Y. Thus, the conditional distribution learned by the underspecified model will not converge toward the unbiased distribution without additional data or assumptions (Bareinboim et al., 2014). However, in the next section we will exploit the outcomes of selection bias to our benefit. 7 EXPLOITING SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS: As discussed in Section 3, underspecified models are more vulnerable to learning spurious associations when trained with selection collider biased data. In this section we turn the problem on its head and use spurious associations to determine if a prediction task may be underspecified, and therefore if the resulting prediction should be deemed uncertain, in a method we call W-injection. We test this using the Winogender Schema evaluation set (Rudinger et al., 2018), composed of 120 sentence templates, hand-written in the style of the Winograd Schemas (Levesque et al., 2012). Originally the Winogender evaluation set was developed to demonstrate that many NLP pipelines produce spurious associations between gender and occupation, often well exceeding any occupationbased gender inequality in the real world. 7.1 WINOGENDER TEXTS: The \u2018Sentence\u2019 column in Table 2 shows example texts from our extended version of the Winogender evaluation set, where the occupation is \u2018doctor\u2019. Each sentence in the evaluation set contains: 1) a professional, referred to by their profession, such as \u2018doctor\u2019 2) a context appropriate participant, referred by one of: {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, other} where other is replaced by a context specific term like \u2018patient\u2019, and 3) a single pronoun that is either coreferent with (1) the professional or 4We pick the number k = 5 for the \u2018top k\u2019 predicted words, because 5 is the default value for the \u2018top k\u2019 argument in the Hugging Face \u2018fillmask()\u2019 function used for inference. (2) the participant in the sentence (Rudinger et al., 2018). For the masked gender task, this pronoun is replaced with a [MASK] for prediction. Our extensions to the evaluation set are twofold: 1) we add {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019} to the list of words used to describe the participant in order to add well-specified tasks to the existing Winogender set, which are all underspecified, and 2) we perform W-injection by prepending each sentence with the phrase \u2018In DATE\u20195, where \u2018DATE\u2019 is replaced by a range of years from 1901 to 20166, similar what was done in Figure 2(a). In Sentence IDs 1 - 4 of Table 2, the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional, who is always referred to as the \u2018doctor\u2019. Whereas in Sentence IDs 5 - 8, the masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant, who is referred to as {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, and \u2018patient\u2019}, respectively. Of the eight sentences, six remain underspecified for the pronoun prediction task, with only IDs 5 & 6 becoming well-specified. Figure 4 shows the predicted softmax probability for female pronouns for the masked words in the Table 2 sentences, normalized to the gendered predictions of the top five predicted words from pre-trained RoBERTa large. Similar to the findings in (Rudinger et al., 2018), the softmax probabilities for female pronouns are higher for masked pronouns coreferent with the patient as opposed to the doctor (for the underspecified sentences) indicating a specific gender bias for traditionally non-female occupations. What is new here is that in Figure 4 we can see that the spurious associations due to the W-injection of an unrelated association (time vs gender) is additive with the existing spurious association between occupation and gender, but only takes on a non-zero value when the prediction task is underspecified. 5Similar results were obtained by using \u2018In PLACE\u2019 and replacing \u2018PLACE\u2019 with countries in Appendix B.1. 6We picked a slightly narrower and more modern date range as compared to that of Figure 2(a) for contextual consistency with some of the more modern occupations in the Winogender evaluation set. (a) Masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional in the sentence, so all these sentences remain underspecified. Like human uncertainty, we see model uncertainty results above 0 for most occupations, regardless of the word injected into evaluation text for the participant, including co-occurring gender-identifying terms. (b) Masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant, so the sentences containing \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 become well-specified, while the rest remain underspecified. Like human uncertainty, we do see uncertainty results close to 0 for most occupations, when \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019 has been injected into the evaluation text for the participant, and generally above 0 otherwise Figure 5: RoBERTa-large uncertainty results on all Winogender Schema occupations. 7.2 UNCERTAINTY METRIC: For an example single-value uncertainty metric, we can measure the absolute difference between the averaged softmax probabilities for the first and last several dates along the x-axis in Figure 4. For this uncertainty metric, we would expect larger values for underspecified prediction tasks, in which the spurious correlation between gender and date has a larger role in influencing the prediction. For the predictions in Figure 4, this metric is shown in the \u2018Uncertainty\u2019 columns in Table 2 for all four LLMs studied in this paper. Here we see uncertainty values closest to 0 for well-specified sentence IDs 5 & 6, consistent with human reasoning about the uncertainty of predicting gender pronouns for these sentences in Table 27. Our extended version of the Winogender Schema contains 60 occupations for the professional \u00d7 4 words used to describe the participant \u00d7 30 values for DATE \u00d7 2 sentence templates (one in which the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional and the other with the participant). This totals to 14,400 test sentences, which we provide as input text to the 4 pre-trained models thus far investigated in this paper: BERT base and large, and RoBERTa base and large. We calculate the above-described uncertainty metric for all 60 occupations in the Winogender evaluation set and show the results from RoBERTa large 1) in Figure 5(a), with input sentences like IDs 1 - 4 where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional, and 2) in Figure 5(b), with input sentences like IDs 5 - 8 where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant. In these plots the x-axis is ordered from lower to higher female representation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics 2015/16 statistics provided by (Rudinger et al., 2018), and the y-axis is the prediction uncertainty metric defined in the proceeding paragraphs. 7As can be seen further in Appendix C, this uncertainty metric appears to report results more consistent with human reasoning in RoBERTa large and generally as the model becomes increasingly over-parameterized. In Figure 5, we again see the model reliably reporting high uncertainty for all six of the underspecified tasks and low uncertainty for the two well-specified tasks, for almost all Winogender evaluation sentences. In particular, the injection of gender-identifying text: \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 into the sentence, reduces the model\u2019s uncertainty only when these gender-identifying terms are coreferent with the masked pronoun for prediction as in Figure 5(b), and not when gender-identifying terms are merely co-occurring as in Figure 5(a). We show similar results for BERT and RoBERTa base and BERT large in Appendix C, but note that the increased parameter count and hyper-parameter optimization in RoBERTa large appears to improve the uncertainty measurement. 8 EXTENDING TO MORE GENERAL SETTING: We now explore a more general problem space where these symbols in Figure 1 take on the following meanings: G is the causal parents of Y, W is the non-causal parents of Y yet nonetheless included because W is a cause of both X and S, where S has the same meaning as before. We can thus partition any feature space into G, and candidates for W . A candidate can be validated as suitable W feature by checking for the conditional dependencies which we will be plotting below. To make this hypothetical example slightly more concrete, we parameterize the structural causal models associated with Figure 1 in these slightly less generic terms shown on the right. G := \u03b1N (0, 1) (5) W := \u03b1 2 N (0, 1) (6) S := (W \u2212G+N (0, 1)) > 2\u03b1 (7) X := W + \u03b3G+N (0, 1) (8) Y := \u03b3X +G+N (0, 1) (9) Equation (5) and Equation (6) define W and G as independent exogenous 0-mean Gaussian noise, for which we set \u03b1 = 10 so that we can more easily trace the amplified noise through the DAG8. Equation (7) defines S as an unweighted combination of W, G and exogenous noise, with the selection mechanism setting all values above 2\u03b1 to 1, and to 0 otherwise. In Equation (8) and Equation (9) we set \u03b3 to 0 for the underspecified task and to 1 for the wellspecified task, consistent with a 0 path weight for the grayed out arrows G\u2192 X and X \u2192 Y in Figure 1(b), and a full path weight for those same arrows in Figure 1(a). Figure 6 plots the statistical relationships induced by the structural causal model defined by equations Equation (5) to Equation (9) for the well-specified (top row in blue) and underspecified (bottom row in green) causal models. Starting with Figure 6(a), columns (i) and (ii) show plots X vs Y for both the unsampled and the S = 1 sampled distributions, respectively. The plotted correlation between X and Y for the well-specified (top two) plots is not greatly affected by the sampling, with the Pearson\u2019s r coefficient going from 0.946 to 0.987. However, for underspecified plots (bottom two), sampling selection bias causes the Pearson\u2019s r coefficient to go from 0.004 to 8We set different noise weights to G and W by arbitrarily dividing \u03b1 by 2 in Equation (6), to reduce the likelihood of unintentionally constructing an unfaithful graph. 0.685, consistent with the selection collider bias induced transformation discussed in Section 3: (Y \u22a5\u22a5X)RW s\u21d2 (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5X)M. In Figure 6(a), columns (iii) and (iv) also show the unsampled and the S = 1 sampled distributions, but for W vs G. Here we also see that the S node subsampling causes W vs G to go from about 0.0 to about 0.7, but for both the underspecified model and well-specified models, rather than the underspecified model alone. This validates that selection collider bias induced P (Y |X) \u223c P (G|W ) only holds underspecified models. For Figure 6(b), we replace Equation (7) with S := (W + G + N (0, 1)) > 2\u03b1, which differs in that we are combining W and G with an addition, rather than a subtraction. The results here are similar to those in Figure 6(a), with the only exception being that due to the updated structural equation for S, the direction of the correlation coefficient has flipped in both selection biased W vs G plots, and only the underspecified X vs Y plot. These results again validate P (Y |X) \u223c P (G|W ) for only the underspecified model. For the toy demonstration of W-injection in Figure 7, we replace Equation (8) with X := \u03b2W +\u03b3G+N (0, 1), where \u03b2 takes on the values: 1) \u03b2 = 1 (thus identical to Equation (8)) 2) \u03b2 = 0.1 and 3) \u03b2 = 0.01. Similar to the results in Section 7, probing P (Y |X) for a range of W values can serve to classify as tasks as underspecified if P (Y |X) is sensitive to W-injection, or well-specified if P (Y |X) is unaffected. 9 DEMONSTRATION AND OPEN-SOURCE CODE: We have developed demos where users can choose their own input text and select almost any BERTlike model hosted on Hugging Face to test for selection collider bias induced spurious correlations and model uncertainty, shown in Appendix D and Appendix E. We will make all code available on github. 10 DISCUSSION: In this paper we have argued that underspecified prediction tasks leave models vulnerable to selection collider bias induced spurious associations, including weakly associating and previously unreported correlations between gender vs time and gender vs place, which we demonstrate on unmodified pre-trained BERT-like models. We have introduced a technique for injecting spurious signals into inference tasks to determine if the task is well-specified or underspecified, and demonstrated this in the form of an uncertainty metric on an established evaluation set. Finally, we have generalized our approach to address a wider range of prediction tasks and shown that our empirical results measured from LLMs can be demonstrated with toy data as well. A GENDER-IDENTIFYING WORDS: See Table 3 for the list of gender-identifying words that were masked for prediction during both finetuning and at inference time for the Masked Gender Task, with the exclusion of \u2018man\u2019 & \u2018woman\u2019 that remained unmasked in the extended Winogender evaluation set. B W VARIABLE X-AXIS VALUES: For {w} we require a list of values that are gender-neutral in the real world, yet due to selection collider bias are hypothesized to be a spectrum of gender-inequitable values in the dataset. For W as date, we just use time itself, as over time women have become more likely to be recorded into historical documents reflected in Wikipedia, so we pick years ranging from 1801 - 2001. For W as place, we use the bottom and top 10 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap ranked countries (see details in B.1). B.1 PLACE VALUES Ordered list of bottom 10 and top 10 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap ranked countries used for the x-axis in Figure 2(b), that were taken directly without modification from https: //www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2021.pdf: \u201dAfghanistan\u201d, \u201dYemen\u201d, \u201dIraq\u201d, \u201dPakistan\u201d, \u201dSyria\u201d, \u201dDemocratic Republic of Congo\u201d, \u201dIran\u201d, \u201dMali\u201d, \u201dChad\u201d, \u201dSaudi Arabia\u201d, \u201dSwitzerland\u201d, \u201dIreland\u201d, \u201dLithuania\u201d, \u201dRwanda\u201d, \u201dNamibia\u201d, \u201dSweden\u201d, \u201dNew Zealand\u201d, \u201dNorway\u201d, \u201dFinland\u201d, \u201dIceland\u201d C EXTENDED WINOGENDER UNCERTAINTY RESULTS ON MORE LLMS: Figure 8 shows Uncertainty results for all Winogender occupations where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional. Because the injected text (one of: {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, \u2018other\u2019}) is referring to the participant and not the professional, all these sentences remain underspecified. The plots show all tested models tend to report uncertainty results above 0 for all occupations, regardless of the word injected into the evaluation text for the participant, thus the models do not become erroneously certain about gender when the words \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 are injected into the text. Figure 9 shows uncertainty results for all Winogender occupations where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant, unlike Figure 8 where the pronoun is coreferent with the professional. Because the injected text (again one of: {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, \u2018other\u2019}) is referring to the participant, the sentences containing \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 become well-specified, while the rest remain underspecified. We see uncertainty results closer to 0 for most occupations when \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019 has been injected into the evaluation text for the participant, and generally above 0 otherwise, in particular for more highly over-parameterized models like BERT large and RoBERTA base & large in Figure 5(b).

The paper title is: Selection Collider Bias in Large Language Models\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: This paper investigates models trained to estimate the conditional distribution: P (Y |X,S), where S is the cause of sample selection bias in the training dataset. Selection bias is not an uncommon problem, as most datasets are subsampled representations of a larger population, yet few are sampled with randomization (Heckman, 1979). Sample selection bias occurs when some mechanism, observed or not, causes samples to be included or excluded from the dataset. Employing the language of causal inference, selection bias is distinct from both confounder and collider bias. Confounder bias can occur when two variables have a common cause, whereas collider bias can occur when two variables have a common effect. Correcting for confounding bias requires that one condition upon the common cause variable; conversely correcting for collider bias requires that one does not condition upon the common effect (Pearl, 2009). While sample selection bias can take many forms, the type of selection bias that interests us here is that which involves more than one variable (observed or not), whose common effect results in selection bias. Such relationships can be compactly represented as a causal model in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), for example illustrated in Figure 1. The absence of arrows connecting nodes in causal DAGs encode assumptions, for example that W and G in 1(a) are stochastically independent of one another. The direction of the arrowhead encodes our assumptions about the direction of causation. For example, two arrows departing from W and G toward S encode the assumption that S is a common effect of W and G. In Figure 1, the twice-encircled node, S, symbolizes some mechanism that can cause samples to be selected into the dataset. To capture the statistical pro- cess of sampling for dataset formation, one must condition on S, thus inducing the collider bias relationship between W and G in the causal model. We will use the term selection collider bias to refer to circumstances such as this one, when the selection bias mechanism induces a collider bias relationship in the dataset, that would not have been there otherwise. Beyond posing a risk to out-of-domain generalizability (Arjovsky et al., 2019), selection collider bias can result in models that lack even \u2018internal validity\u2019, as the associations learned from the data represent the statistical dependencies induced by the dataset formation and not the data itself (Griffith et al., 2020). 2 UNDERSPECIFICATION: The link between underspecification in machine learning, and the resulting spurious correlations and risks to out-of-domain generalization is investigated thoroughly in (D\u2019Amour et al., 2020). In this work, underspecification is defined in the context of having multiple predictors with equally low predictive risk (or some other risk minimization) scores. In the NLP setting, (Manning, 2011) provide an example of underspecification in a part-of-speech tagging task, in which a given sentence context makes it unclear whether the word, \u2018discontinued\u2019, should have the label \u2018adjective\u2019 or \u2018verbal participle\u2019. In this paper, we are interested in the underspecification that occurs when none of the features available to the model (at training or inference time) are causes of the label. With no causal features available, models must resort to learning any spurious associations that will reduce predictive risk, regardless of how tenuous the association may be. Thus, models trained with selection collider biased data are particularly vulnerable to learning statistical associations in underspecified learning tasks. A single prediction task may be partitioned into well-specified and underspecified \u2018sub\u2019-tasks. In the example from (Manning, 2011), we can assume a well-specified \u2018sub\u2019-task reduced the set of all possible prediction classes to the set containing just \u2018adjective\u2019 and \u2018verbal participle\u2019, while the underspecified \u2018sub\u2019-task must then determine which of the two remaining classes is correct. For much of this paper we will consider a similar scenario: where the well-specified portion of the masked language modeling (MLM) task may have correctly predicted that a gender pronoun should fill-in a masked-out word, however the \u2018sub\u2019-task of determining which gender pronoun to predict is underspecified. 3 PLAUSIBLE CAUSAL MODELS: Figure 1 shows plausible data-generating processes for the relevant features and labels in the abovementioned task of gender pronoun resolution. In Figure 1(a), the symbol X represents context sentences in our dataset, and Y represents the label, specifically a gender pronoun. The arrow pointing from X to Y encodes our assumption that X , is more likely to cause Y, rather than vice versa. For example, in a sentence about a father and daughter going to the park, the sentence context determines which gender pronoun is most appropriate. The remaining symbols in Figure 1(a) are not recorded in the dataset, but rather represent entities or mechanisms that may cause X or Y. The symbol G represents gender and causes both the context and gender pronoun. W represents various gender-neutral entities, such as time, place, or genderneutral hobbies, and is included in the causal DAG because it may be a cause of both X and S. Finally, the selection node, S, takes the value of S=1 for samples in the data and S=0 otherwise. In Figure 1, S is the common effect of W and G, and represents access to the dataset. The W \u2192 S \u2190 G relationship can represent any selection bias mechanism that has a gender dependency upon otherwise gender-neutral entities. For example, in data sources like Wikipedia written about people, it is plausible that access has become increasingly less gender dependent as the date approaches more modern times, but not evenly in every place. In data sources like Reddit written by people, W \u2192 S \u2190 G can plausibly capture the scenario that even in the case of subreddits about gender-neutral hobbies, the style of the moderation and community may result in gender-disparate access to a given subreddit. Now, in Figure 1(b), we can see the underspecified counterpart of the well-specified prediction task in Figure 1(a). As defined above, to achieve the underspecification of interest here, we must obscure any causal features from X . In the case of gender pronoun resolution, this is achieved by removing the path between gender and context. Further, because W is also gender-neutral, once we have removed any gender-identifying features from context, we should additionally remove the path between context and gender-pronouns, as there is no longer any feature of X causing Y. With the causal path from X \u2192 Y removed, had there been no backdoor path from X to Y, then we would then expect X and Y to be unconditionally independent in the real world (RW ). However, in the scenario depicted in Figure 1(b), selection collider bias has opened the backdoor path, X \u2190W \u2192 S \u2190 G\u2192 Y , Thus, the learned model (LM ) is encouraged to learn any spurious association along this path that reduces predictive risk, resulting in X and Y becoming unconditionally dependent. Formally, selection collider bias causes the transformation: (Y \u22a5\u22a5X)RW s\u21d2 (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5X)LM, due to even very weakly interacting spurious associations, such as those between gender and time. Whereas spurious associations learned in the well-specified model would be likely due to signals that are stronger than those along the causal path X \u2192 Y 1. 3.1 MASKED GENDER TASK: Beyond just claiming plausibility, we can evaluate measured data from LLMs to support our arguments for the causal relationships in Figure 1, after making two additional assumptions: For a given causal graph, Gr, and a measured probability distribution Pr, we are assuming 1) the Markov assumption: (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Gr =\u21d2 (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Pr and 2) faithfulness: (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Gr \u21d0= (X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z)Pr, where Z is the set {W,G, S} (Peters et al., 2017). To obtain the measured probability distribution Pr, we developed the masked gender task (MGT), a special case of the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective, that uses a heuristic to build underspecified learning tasks by masking common gender-identifying words for prediction (see Appendix A), which we used to finetune two models. We use these finetuned models as comparison baselines against unmodified pre-trained BERT base and large (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa base and large (Liu et al., 2019) models, tested using our MGT evaluation set described in Table 1. We argue it is not implausible that during MLM pre-training, gender-identifying words are masked for prediction in otherwise gender-neutral sequences. Further, at inference time, the prediction of gender-identifying words or labels from gender-neutral text is common to many downstream tasks such as dialog generation, machine translation from genderless to more gendered languages, or any task requiring gendered predictions from gender-underspecified features. 4 SELECTION COLLIDER BIAS: Before sharing our LLM measurements, we further motivate the mechanisms behind selection collider bias. Revisiting Figure 1(a), to estimate the causal effect of X on Y here, we could the use back-door adjustment (Pearl, 2009), with an admissible set {G} to calculate: P (Y |do(X)) =\u2211 G P (Y |X,G)P (G). The observation of G in the dataset makes this a trivial problem to solve. 1One example of spurious associations learned despite a well-specified task is that of an image background (desert vs grass) providing a stronger signal than the animal foreground (camel vs cow) (Arjovsky et al., 2019). (a) Spurious correlation between gender and time plotted as averaged softmax probabilities for predicted gender pronouns vs a range of dates. (b) Spurious correlation between gender and place as list of countries, ordered by their Global Gender Gap rank (see Appendix B.1). Figure 2: Softmax probabilities for LLM predictions displaying spurious correlation between gender and gender-neutral entities injected into gender-neutral input texts described in Table 1 Although the S node is not explicitly recorded in the dataset, even if S were available to us, we would not condition on it, as this would induce collider bias between G and W in the form of S\u2019s structural equation (Pearl, 2009): S := fs(W,G,Us), where Us is the exogenous noise of the S variable. As mentioned above, to capture the statistical process of dataset formation, we implicitly condition on S = 1 for all the samples in the dataset. Now applying the above-mentioned Markov and faithfulness assumptions to the underspecified model in Figure 1(b), we can estimate the conditional probability of a gender-identifying word, Y, given gender-neutral text, X , in a LLM as shown in Equation (1) through Equation (4). P (Y |X) = P (Y |X,S=1) (1) \u223c P (G|X,S=1) (2) \u223c P (G|X,W ) (3) \u223c P (G|W ) (4) Equation (1) shows a mapping from the target unbiased quantity to the measured selection biased data, as defined in (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012). Equation (2) assumes very high correlation between the textual form of gender in Y (as a \u2018gender-identifying word\u2019) with the symbolic variable for gender, G. Equation (3) replaces S with the variables in its structural equation, S := fs(W,G,Us), which entails the conditional dependence P (G|W ) \u0338= P (G). Finally, Equation (4) assumes we have successfully achieved a gender-neutral text, X, and thus P (G|X) = P (G). Equation (1) - Equation (4) show that conditional probability P (Y |X) obtained by applying the underspecified task in Figure 1(b) to an LLM, should be distributed similarly to P (G|W ). This provides information about the latent representations for G and W, which are otherwise inaccessible. Additionally, these equations provide insights into the role of selection collider bias in the transformation from real-world (RW ) unconditional independence to learned model (LM ) unconditional dependence discussed in Section 3: (Y \u22a5\u22a5X)RW \u2248 (G \u22a5\u22a5W )RW s\u21d2 (G\u22a5\u0338\u22a5W )LM \u2248 (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5X)LM. 5 PRE-TRAINED LLMS G,W DEPENDENCY Figure 2(a) shows pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa base and large results, as well as results for models finetuned with the MGT objective2. Each plotted dot is the softmax probability (averaged over 60 gender-neutral texts) for the predicted gender pronouns vs year, where year in the x-axis matches that gender-neutral W value injected into the gender-neutral text3. 2The finetuned models serve as a rough upper limit for the magnitude of expected spurious correlations. 3For example, the purple and green dots at the x-axis position of W = 1938 are the softmax predictions for the masked word in input texts like \u2018In 1938, [MASK] will became a teenager.\u2019, for female and male pronouns. The shaded regions show the 95% confidence interval for the linear fit. Unlike the finetuned model\u2019s binary prediction, because the final layer in the pre-trained model is a softmax over the entire tokenizer\u2019s vocabulary, we sum the gender-identified portion (as listed in Table 3) of the probability mass from the top five predicted words4. We argue the spurious associations in Figure 2, between W along the x-axis and predicted gender, G, along the y-axis, supports our supports our hypothesis that selection collider bias has resulted in these LLMs learning P (Y |X) \u223c P (G|W ), for entities G and W that would be otherwise unconditionally independent. Figure 3 shows the slope and Pearson\u2019s r correlation coefficient (following (Rudinger et al., 2018)) of the y-axis value against the index of the x-axis, for all the plots in Figure 2. As expected, we see the slope and correlation coefficients highest in the finetuned models. We do nonetheless see comparable coefficients for the spurious W,G depen- dency in the unmodified pre-trained models, supporting our hypothesis that these models are learning from underspecified tasks such as that in Figure 1(b). 6 SELECTION BIAS RECOVERY: In (Bareinboim et al., 2014) it is proven that one can recover the unbiased conditional distribution P (Y |X) from a causal DAG, GS , with selection bias: P (Y |X,S =1), if and only if the selection mechanism can become conditionally independent of the effect, given the cause: (Y \u22a5\u22a5 S|X)GS . However, in Figure 1(b) we can see (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5 S|X) trivially, due to the lack of a direct path between X and Y. Thus, the conditional distribution learned by the underspecified model will not converge toward the unbiased distribution without additional data or assumptions (Bareinboim et al., 2014). However, in the next section we will exploit the outcomes of selection bias to our benefit. 7 EXPLOITING SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS: As discussed in Section 3, underspecified models are more vulnerable to learning spurious associations when trained with selection collider biased data. In this section we turn the problem on its head and use spurious associations to determine if a prediction task may be underspecified, and therefore if the resulting prediction should be deemed uncertain, in a method we call W-injection. We test this using the Winogender Schema evaluation set (Rudinger et al., 2018), composed of 120 sentence templates, hand-written in the style of the Winograd Schemas (Levesque et al., 2012). Originally the Winogender evaluation set was developed to demonstrate that many NLP pipelines produce spurious associations between gender and occupation, often well exceeding any occupationbased gender inequality in the real world. 7.1 WINOGENDER TEXTS: The \u2018Sentence\u2019 column in Table 2 shows example texts from our extended version of the Winogender evaluation set, where the occupation is \u2018doctor\u2019. Each sentence in the evaluation set contains: 1) a professional, referred to by their profession, such as \u2018doctor\u2019 2) a context appropriate participant, referred by one of: {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, other} where other is replaced by a context specific term like \u2018patient\u2019, and 3) a single pronoun that is either coreferent with (1) the professional or 4We pick the number k = 5 for the \u2018top k\u2019 predicted words, because 5 is the default value for the \u2018top k\u2019 argument in the Hugging Face \u2018fillmask()\u2019 function used for inference. (2) the participant in the sentence (Rudinger et al., 2018). For the masked gender task, this pronoun is replaced with a [MASK] for prediction. Our extensions to the evaluation set are twofold: 1) we add {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019} to the list of words used to describe the participant in order to add well-specified tasks to the existing Winogender set, which are all underspecified, and 2) we perform W-injection by prepending each sentence with the phrase \u2018In DATE\u20195, where \u2018DATE\u2019 is replaced by a range of years from 1901 to 20166, similar what was done in Figure 2(a). In Sentence IDs 1 - 4 of Table 2, the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional, who is always referred to as the \u2018doctor\u2019. Whereas in Sentence IDs 5 - 8, the masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant, who is referred to as {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, and \u2018patient\u2019}, respectively. Of the eight sentences, six remain underspecified for the pronoun prediction task, with only IDs 5 & 6 becoming well-specified. Figure 4 shows the predicted softmax probability for female pronouns for the masked words in the Table 2 sentences, normalized to the gendered predictions of the top five predicted words from pre-trained RoBERTa large. Similar to the findings in (Rudinger et al., 2018), the softmax probabilities for female pronouns are higher for masked pronouns coreferent with the patient as opposed to the doctor (for the underspecified sentences) indicating a specific gender bias for traditionally non-female occupations. What is new here is that in Figure 4 we can see that the spurious associations due to the W-injection of an unrelated association (time vs gender) is additive with the existing spurious association between occupation and gender, but only takes on a non-zero value when the prediction task is underspecified. 5Similar results were obtained by using \u2018In PLACE\u2019 and replacing \u2018PLACE\u2019 with countries in Appendix B.1. 6We picked a slightly narrower and more modern date range as compared to that of Figure 2(a) for contextual consistency with some of the more modern occupations in the Winogender evaluation set. (a) Masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional in the sentence, so all these sentences remain underspecified. Like human uncertainty, we see model uncertainty results above 0 for most occupations, regardless of the word injected into evaluation text for the participant, including co-occurring gender-identifying terms. (b) Masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant, so the sentences containing \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 become well-specified, while the rest remain underspecified. Like human uncertainty, we do see uncertainty results close to 0 for most occupations, when \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019 has been injected into the evaluation text for the participant, and generally above 0 otherwise Figure 5: RoBERTa-large uncertainty results on all Winogender Schema occupations. 7.2 UNCERTAINTY METRIC: For an example single-value uncertainty metric, we can measure the absolute difference between the averaged softmax probabilities for the first and last several dates along the x-axis in Figure 4. For this uncertainty metric, we would expect larger values for underspecified prediction tasks, in which the spurious correlation between gender and date has a larger role in influencing the prediction. For the predictions in Figure 4, this metric is shown in the \u2018Uncertainty\u2019 columns in Table 2 for all four LLMs studied in this paper. Here we see uncertainty values closest to 0 for well-specified sentence IDs 5 & 6, consistent with human reasoning about the uncertainty of predicting gender pronouns for these sentences in Table 27. Our extended version of the Winogender Schema contains 60 occupations for the professional \u00d7 4 words used to describe the participant \u00d7 30 values for DATE \u00d7 2 sentence templates (one in which the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional and the other with the participant). This totals to 14,400 test sentences, which we provide as input text to the 4 pre-trained models thus far investigated in this paper: BERT base and large, and RoBERTa base and large. We calculate the above-described uncertainty metric for all 60 occupations in the Winogender evaluation set and show the results from RoBERTa large 1) in Figure 5(a), with input sentences like IDs 1 - 4 where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional, and 2) in Figure 5(b), with input sentences like IDs 5 - 8 where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant. In these plots the x-axis is ordered from lower to higher female representation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics 2015/16 statistics provided by (Rudinger et al., 2018), and the y-axis is the prediction uncertainty metric defined in the proceeding paragraphs. 7As can be seen further in Appendix C, this uncertainty metric appears to report results more consistent with human reasoning in RoBERTa large and generally as the model becomes increasingly over-parameterized. In Figure 5, we again see the model reliably reporting high uncertainty for all six of the underspecified tasks and low uncertainty for the two well-specified tasks, for almost all Winogender evaluation sentences. In particular, the injection of gender-identifying text: \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 into the sentence, reduces the model\u2019s uncertainty only when these gender-identifying terms are coreferent with the masked pronoun for prediction as in Figure 5(b), and not when gender-identifying terms are merely co-occurring as in Figure 5(a). We show similar results for BERT and RoBERTa base and BERT large in Appendix C, but note that the increased parameter count and hyper-parameter optimization in RoBERTa large appears to improve the uncertainty measurement. 8 EXTENDING TO MORE GENERAL SETTING: We now explore a more general problem space where these symbols in Figure 1 take on the following meanings: G is the causal parents of Y, W is the non-causal parents of Y yet nonetheless included because W is a cause of both X and S, where S has the same meaning as before. We can thus partition any feature space into G, and candidates for W . A candidate can be validated as suitable W feature by checking for the conditional dependencies which we will be plotting below. To make this hypothetical example slightly more concrete, we parameterize the structural causal models associated with Figure 1 in these slightly less generic terms shown on the right. G := \u03b1N (0, 1) (5) W := \u03b1 2 N (0, 1) (6) S := (W \u2212G+N (0, 1)) > 2\u03b1 (7) X := W + \u03b3G+N (0, 1) (8) Y := \u03b3X +G+N (0, 1) (9) Equation (5) and Equation (6) define W and G as independent exogenous 0-mean Gaussian noise, for which we set \u03b1 = 10 so that we can more easily trace the amplified noise through the DAG8. Equation (7) defines S as an unweighted combination of W, G and exogenous noise, with the selection mechanism setting all values above 2\u03b1 to 1, and to 0 otherwise. In Equation (8) and Equation (9) we set \u03b3 to 0 for the underspecified task and to 1 for the wellspecified task, consistent with a 0 path weight for the grayed out arrows G\u2192 X and X \u2192 Y in Figure 1(b), and a full path weight for those same arrows in Figure 1(a). Figure 6 plots the statistical relationships induced by the structural causal model defined by equations Equation (5) to Equation (9) for the well-specified (top row in blue) and underspecified (bottom row in green) causal models. Starting with Figure 6(a), columns (i) and (ii) show plots X vs Y for both the unsampled and the S = 1 sampled distributions, respectively. The plotted correlation between X and Y for the well-specified (top two) plots is not greatly affected by the sampling, with the Pearson\u2019s r coefficient going from 0.946 to 0.987. However, for underspecified plots (bottom two), sampling selection bias causes the Pearson\u2019s r coefficient to go from 0.004 to 8We set different noise weights to G and W by arbitrarily dividing \u03b1 by 2 in Equation (6), to reduce the likelihood of unintentionally constructing an unfaithful graph. 0.685, consistent with the selection collider bias induced transformation discussed in Section 3: (Y \u22a5\u22a5X)RW s\u21d2 (Y \u22a5\u0338\u22a5X)M. In Figure 6(a), columns (iii) and (iv) also show the unsampled and the S = 1 sampled distributions, but for W vs G. Here we also see that the S node subsampling causes W vs G to go from about 0.0 to about 0.7, but for both the underspecified model and well-specified models, rather than the underspecified model alone. This validates that selection collider bias induced P (Y |X) \u223c P (G|W ) only holds underspecified models. For Figure 6(b), we replace Equation (7) with S := (W + G + N (0, 1)) > 2\u03b1, which differs in that we are combining W and G with an addition, rather than a subtraction. The results here are similar to those in Figure 6(a), with the only exception being that due to the updated structural equation for S, the direction of the correlation coefficient has flipped in both selection biased W vs G plots, and only the underspecified X vs Y plot. These results again validate P (Y |X) \u223c P (G|W ) for only the underspecified model. For the toy demonstration of W-injection in Figure 7, we replace Equation (8) with X := \u03b2W +\u03b3G+N (0, 1), where \u03b2 takes on the values: 1) \u03b2 = 1 (thus identical to Equation (8)) 2) \u03b2 = 0.1 and 3) \u03b2 = 0.01. Similar to the results in Section 7, probing P (Y |X) for a range of W values can serve to classify as tasks as underspecified if P (Y |X) is sensitive to W-injection, or well-specified if P (Y |X) is unaffected. 9 DEMONSTRATION AND OPEN-SOURCE CODE: We have developed demos where users can choose their own input text and select almost any BERTlike model hosted on Hugging Face to test for selection collider bias induced spurious correlations and model uncertainty, shown in Appendix D and Appendix E. We will make all code available on github. 10 DISCUSSION: In this paper we have argued that underspecified prediction tasks leave models vulnerable to selection collider bias induced spurious associations, including weakly associating and previously unreported correlations between gender vs time and gender vs place, which we demonstrate on unmodified pre-trained BERT-like models. We have introduced a technique for injecting spurious signals into inference tasks to determine if the task is well-specified or underspecified, and demonstrated this in the form of an uncertainty metric on an established evaluation set. Finally, we have generalized our approach to address a wider range of prediction tasks and shown that our empirical results measured from LLMs can be demonstrated with toy data as well. A GENDER-IDENTIFYING WORDS: See Table 3 for the list of gender-identifying words that were masked for prediction during both finetuning and at inference time for the Masked Gender Task, with the exclusion of \u2018man\u2019 & \u2018woman\u2019 that remained unmasked in the extended Winogender evaluation set. B W VARIABLE X-AXIS VALUES: For {w} we require a list of values that are gender-neutral in the real world, yet due to selection collider bias are hypothesized to be a spectrum of gender-inequitable values in the dataset. For W as date, we just use time itself, as over time women have become more likely to be recorded into historical documents reflected in Wikipedia, so we pick years ranging from 1801 - 2001. For W as place, we use the bottom and top 10 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap ranked countries (see details in B.1). B.1 PLACE VALUES Ordered list of bottom 10 and top 10 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap ranked countries used for the x-axis in Figure 2(b), that were taken directly without modification from https: //www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2021.pdf: \u201dAfghanistan\u201d, \u201dYemen\u201d, \u201dIraq\u201d, \u201dPakistan\u201d, \u201dSyria\u201d, \u201dDemocratic Republic of Congo\u201d, \u201dIran\u201d, \u201dMali\u201d, \u201dChad\u201d, \u201dSaudi Arabia\u201d, \u201dSwitzerland\u201d, \u201dIreland\u201d, \u201dLithuania\u201d, \u201dRwanda\u201d, \u201dNamibia\u201d, \u201dSweden\u201d, \u201dNew Zealand\u201d, \u201dNorway\u201d, \u201dFinland\u201d, \u201dIceland\u201d C EXTENDED WINOGENDER UNCERTAINTY RESULTS ON MORE LLMS: Figure 8 shows Uncertainty results for all Winogender occupations where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the professional. Because the injected text (one of: {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, \u2018other\u2019}) is referring to the participant and not the professional, all these sentences remain underspecified. The plots show all tested models tend to report uncertainty results above 0 for all occupations, regardless of the word injected into the evaluation text for the participant, thus the models do not become erroneously certain about gender when the words \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 are injected into the text. Figure 9 shows uncertainty results for all Winogender occupations where the masked pronoun is coreferent with the participant, unlike Figure 8 where the pronoun is coreferent with the professional. Because the injected text (again one of: {\u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018someone\u2019, \u2018other\u2019}) is referring to the participant, the sentences containing \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 become well-specified, while the rest remain underspecified. We see uncertainty results closer to 0 for most occupations when \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019 has been injected into the evaluation text for the participant, and generally above 0 otherwise, in particular for more highly over-parameterized models like BERT large and RoBERTA base & large in Figure 5(b).

The key ingredient is collider bias. In the language of\\ncausal models, a collider is a variable causally influenced by two or more\\nother variables. Conditioning on a collider typically produces non-causal\\ncorrelations between its contributing causes. This phenomenon can produce\\nassociations analogous to Bell correlations, in suitable post-selected\\nensembles. Such collider artefacts may become real connections, resembling\\ncausality, if a collider is 'constrained' (e.g., by a future boundary\\ncondition). We consider the time-reversed analogues of these points in the\\ncontext of retrocausal models of QM. Retrocausality yields a collider at the\\nsource of an EPR-Bell particle pair, and in this case constraint of the\\ncollider is possible by normal methods of experimental preparation. It follows\\nthat connections resembling causality may emerge across such colliders, from\\none branch of the experiment to the other. Our hypothesis is that this\\nconstrained retrocausal collider bias is the origin of entanglement.

Our findings revealed\\nsignificant gender biases across all the languages we examined.', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00277v1'}, {'title': 'IndiVec: An Exploration of Leveraging Large Language Models for Media Bias Detection with Fine-Grained Bias Indicators', 'authors': ['Luyang Lin', 'Lingzhi Wang', 'Xiaoyan Zhao', 'Jing Li', 'Kam-Fai Wong'], 'published': '2024-02-01T05:20:07+00:00', 'summary': \"This study focuses on media bias detection, crucial in today's era of\\ninfluential social media platforms shaping individual attitudes and opinions.\\nIn contrast to prior work that primarily relies on training specific models\\ntailored to particular datasets, resulting in limited adaptability and subpar\\nperformance on out-of-domain data, we introduce a general bias detection\\nframework, IndiVec, built upon large language models. IndiVec begins by\\nconstructing a fine-grained media bias database, leveraging the robust\\ninstruction-following capabilities of large language models and vector database\\ntechniques. When confronted with new input for bias detection, our framework\\nautomatically selects the most relevant indicator from the vector database and\\nemploys majority voting to determine the input's bias label.

The key ingredient is collider bias. In the language of\\ncausal models, a collider is a variable causally influenced by two or more\\nother variables. Conditioning on a collider typically produces non-causal\\ncorrelations between its contributing causes. This phenomenon can produce\\nassociations analogous to Bell correlations, in suitable post-selected\\nensembles. Such collider artefacts may become real connections, resembling\\ncausality, if a collider is 'constrained' (e.g., by a future boundary\\ncondition). We consider the time-reversed analogues of these points in the\\ncontext of retrocausal models of QM. Retrocausality yields a collider at the\\nsource of an EPR-Bell particle pair, and in this case constraint of the\\ncollider is possible by normal methods of experimental preparation. It follows\\nthat connections resembling causality may emerge across such colliders, from\\none branch of the experiment to the other. Our hypothesis is that this\\nconstrained retrocausal collider bias is the origin of entanglement.

Overall Assessment**\\n*   **Initial Impression:** Does the paper clearly state its causal question and articulate *why* a causal inference approach is necessary? Does it attempt to move beyond mere association?\\n*   **Ambition vs. Feasibility:** Is the causal claim ambitious given the data and context, or does it seem achievable within the chosen methodology?\\n\\n**II. Causal Question and DAG Specification**\\n*   **Clarity of Causal Question:**\\n    *   Is the exposure (treatment) clearly defined? Is it a well-defined intervention (e.g., \\\"taking drug X\\\" vs. \\\"experiencing poverty\\\")? Is it binary, categorical, or continuous?\\n    *   Is the outcome clearly defined?\\n    *   Are the counterfactuals explicit or implicit? (e.g., \\\"What would happen to Y if T were set to 1 vs. 0?\\\")\\n*   **Validity of the DAG (The Causal Model):**\\n    *   **Explicit Presentation:** Is the DAG clearly drawn and presented? This is fundamental.\\n    *   **Justification of Edges (Arrows):** For every arrow in the DAG, is there a clear, plausible, and ideally evidence-based justification for that causal relationship? (e.g., \\\"Age causes health status,\\\" \\\"SES causes education\\\"). Are *missing* edges also justified (i.e., assuming no direct effect)?\\n    *   **Completeness of the DAG:** Does the DAG include all known or suspected variables relevant to the causal question (exposure, outcome, confounders, mediators, colliders)?\\n    *   **Acyclicity:** Is the DAG truly acyclic (no feedback loops)? For many real-world phenomena (e.g., socioeconomic systems), this is a strong assumption. If cyclic relationships exist, is this acknowledged, and are appropriate methods (e.g., dynamic causal models) considered?\\n    *   **Unmeasured Confounders:** Are there any unmeasured variables that plausibly confound the exposure-outcome relationship (i.e., cause both exposure and outcome)? If so, how are they addressed? (This is often the Achilles' heel of observational studies).\\n    *   **Mediators vs. Confounders:** Are variables correctly classified? Conditioning on a mediator (a variable on the causal path from T to Y) will bias the total causal effect estimate.\\n    *   **Colliders:** Are there any colliders (variables caused by two other variables, one being T or a cause of T, and the other being Y or a cause of Y) that are *conditioned on* (either by adjustment or sample selection)? Conditioning on a collider opens a spurious path and introduces bias.\\n    *   **Selection Bias:** Is the sample selection process explicitly modeled in the DAG? If not, is there potential for selection bias (e.g., only including individuals who survived, or who completed a program)?\\n    *   **Measurement Error:** Is measurement error acknowledged and its potential impact on causal estimates discussed?\\n\\n**III. Appropriateness of Applying Causal Inference Techniques**\\n*   **Identifiability:** Given the proposed DAG and the available data, is the causal effect *identifiable*?\\n    *   **Backdoor Criterion:** If using backdoor adjustment, have all backdoor paths between exposure and outcome been blocked by the chosen adjustment set, without blocking any causal paths or opening spurious paths through colliders? Is the set of measured confounders sufficient?\\n    *   **Assumptions for Specific Methods:**\\n        *   **No Unmeasured Confounding:** This is the most critical assumption for backdoor adjustment methods. Is it stated and justified? (e.g., \\\"We believe all common causes of T and Y are measured\\\"). This is rarely fully justifiable in complex real-world scenarios.\\n        *   **Positivity (Overlap):** Is there sufficient overlap in the covariate distributions between the treated and untreated groups? If not, estimation can be unstable or impossible for certain covariate combinations. Is this checked (e.g., via propensity score overlap plots)?\\n        *   **Consistency (SUTVA - Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption):**\\n            *   *No Interference:* One individual's treatment status does not affect another's outcome. This can be problematic in social networks or clustered data.\\n            *   *No Multiple Versions of Treatment:* The treatment is consistently defined and delivered.\\n            *   *Well-Defined Treatment:* The intervention is clear.\\n        *   **Correct Model Specification (for parametric methods):** If using regression for adjustment or propensity score estimation, are the functional forms correctly specified (e.g., linearity, interaction terms)? Are alternative specifications explored? (Non-parametric methods like targeted learning or machine learning-based estimation can mitigate this but introduce other challenges).\\n        *   **Instrumental Variables (if used):** Are the three core IV assumptions met and justified? (1) The instrument directly affects only the exposure. (2) The instrument does not directly affect the outcome. (3) The instrument and outcome do not share unmeasured common causes. These are incredibly strong assumptions and rarely perfectly met.\\n        *   **Regression Discontinuity/DiD (if used):** Are the specific assumptions for these designs met (e.g., continuity of covariates at cutoff for RD, parallel trends for DiD)?\\n\\n**IV. Correctness of Causal Reasoning and Interpretation**\\n*   **Distinction Between Association and Causation:** Does the paper consistently differentiate between observed associations and the inferred causal effects?\\n*   **Interpretation of Effects:** Are the estimated effects interpreted correctly (e.g., Average Treatment Effect (ATE), Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE))? Are the units clear?\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Is a sensitivity analysis performed to assess the robustness of the findings to potential violations of key assumptions (especially unmeasured confounding)? This is a major strength if present, and a significant weakness if absent. (e.g., \\\"What if there was an unmeasured confounder X' that accounted for Y% of the variance in T and Z% in Y?\\\").\\n*   **Limitations:** Are the limitations of the causal analysis clearly acknowledged and discussed? Does the discussion section temper conclusions appropriately given these limitations?\\n*   **Generalizability:** Are the findings generalized beyond the study population, and if so, is this generalization justified?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Strengths and Weaknesses (Common Patterns)**\\n\\n**Common Strengths:**\\n*   **Explicit DAGs:** A major strength is the explicit construction and presentation of a DAG, demonstrating clear thought about causal pathways.\\n*   **Clear Causal Question:** A well-defined exposure and outcome, and a precise causal question.\\n*   **Comprehensive Covariate Adjustment:** Identification and measurement of a wide range of plausible confounders.\\n*   **Use of Multiple Methods:** Applying more than one causal inference technique (e.g., IPW and G-computation) and checking for consistency.\\n*   **Robustness Checks/Sensitivity Analysis:** Crucial for demonstrating the reliability of findings in the face of unmeasured confounding or model misspecification.\\n*   **Discussion of Limitations:** Acknowledging the inherent difficulties in causal inference from observational data.\\n\\n**Common Weaknesses:**\\n*   **Unjustified No Unmeasured Confounding Assumption:** This is the most common and often fatal flaw. Without strong justification or sensitivity analysis, causal claims are tenuous.\\n*   **Lack of Positivity Checks:** Failure to assess covariate overlap, leading to potentially unstable or biased estimates in regions of sparse data.\\n*   **Unjustified DAG Structure:** Arrows and missing arrows are assumed rather than justified by domain knowledge or prior evidence.\\n*   **Conditioning on Colliders or Mediators:** Misapplication of the backdoor criterion, leading to biased estimates.\\n*   **Ignoring Selection Bias:** Failure to account for how the study sample was selected, potentially introducing bias.\\n*   **Over-interpretation of Results:** Presenting results as definitive causal effects without sufficiently strong evidence or acknowledging limitations.\\n*   **No Sensitivity Analysis:** A significant limitation in most observational causal studies.\\n*   **SUTVA Violations:** Overlooking potential interference between units or multiple versions of treatment.\\n*   **Failure to Model Time:** For longitudinal data, static DAGs might be insufficient, and dynamic models (e.g., g-methods) might be more appropriate.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy applying this framework to the specific content of the paper, I can provide a detailed and actionable evaluation of its causal analysis.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.8791222\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the causal models presented in the paper, focusing on their validity and the assumptions made.

The model is then prompted to fill in the mask.\\n\\n**Example Scenarios:**\\n1.  **Profession-Pronoun Association:** \\\"The doctor entered the room. [MASK] performed surgery.\\\" (Expected: \\\"he/she/they\\\")\\n2.  **Stereotypical Profession Fill-in:** \\\"The [MASK] was often found in the kitchen.\\\" (Expected: \\\"woman/housewife/cook\\\")\\n3.  **Role Assignment:** \\\"The [MASK] brought the children to school and then went to work.\\\" (Expected: \\\"mother/father/parent\\\")\\n\\nThe model's outputs are then analyzed for their gender distribution, often comparing the frequency of male, female, or gender-neutral assignments for various professions, roles, or actions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Detailed Evaluation**\\n\\n#### **1. Design of the Masked Gender Task**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n1.  **Quantifiability and Reproducibility:** The task is inherently quantitative, allowing for clear counting of gendered outputs. This makes results easily reproducible and comparable across different models or model versions.\\n2.  **Isolation of Variable:** By controlling the sentence structure and only varying the masked element, the task attempts to isolate the model's association between context and gender, making it straightforward to detect stereotypical mappings.\\n3.  **Illustrative of Stereotypical Bias:** It provides a clear, demonstrable measure of representational bias, specifically concerning gender stereotypes associated with roles, professions, or attributes. This makes it easy to communicate the presence of a specific type of bias to a broader audience.\\n4.  **Early Detection:** Such tasks can be useful for identifying strong gender associations in LLMs early in their development or fine-tuning process.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n1.  **Oversimplification of \\\"Bias\\\":** This task primarily measures *representational bias* (specifically, associations with stereotypes). It often fails to capture other critical dimensions of bias, such as:\\n    *   **Allocative Harm:** Does the bias lead to concrete disadvantages for certain groups (e.g., job application screening, loan approvals)?\\n    *   **Quality of Service Harm:** Is the model's performance or utility degraded for certain demographic groups (e.g., worse translation, less accurate medical advice)?\\n    *   **Harmful Generalizations/Degradation:** Does the model generate demeaning, toxic, or discriminatory content based on gender?\\n    *   **Intersectionality:** The task typically focuses on binary gender and often neglects intersectional biases (e.g., gender + race, gender + disability).\\n2.  **Artificiality and Lack of Ecological Validity:** LLMs are rarely used in a \\\"fill-in-the-mask\\\" manner in real-world applications. The task's constrained nature might not reflect how biases manifest in open-ended conversations, creative writing, or complex problem-solving scenarios.\\n3.  **Context Sensitivity Issues:** While attempting to control context, it often oversimplifies it. For example, \\\"The nurse\\\" might elicit a female pronoun, but \\\"The male nurse\\\" should elicit a male pronoun. Does the task sufficiently vary context to test this nuance? What about cultural or regional variations in gender roles?\\n4.  **Binary Gender Assumption:** Most masked gender tasks implicitly or explicitly operate on a binary male/female framework, overlooking non-binary, gender-fluid, or other gender identities, thus reinforcing a limited view of gender.\\n5.  **Entanglement of Data Bias vs. Model Bias:** The task reveals that the *model reflects* gender associations present in its training data. It doesn't necessarily tell us if the model *amplifies* these biases beyond what's statistically present in the data, or if it actively *generates* new biases. It's a reflection, not necessarily an amplification test.\\n6.  **Normative \\\"Correctness\\\" Ambiguity:** What is the \\\"unbiased\\\" expectation for a masked pronoun task? A perfectly balanced 50/50 distribution of \\\"he/she\\\"? A distribution that mirrors real-world demographics (which may themselves be biased)? A gender-neutral option (\\\"they\\\") as the default? The definition of a \\\"fair\\\" outcome is often implicit and can vary.\\n\\n#### **2. Interpretation of Experimental Results**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n1.  **Clear Identification of Stereotypes:** If the model consistently assigns a specific gender to a profession (e.g., \\\"she\\\" for nurse, \\\"he\\\" for engineer), the interpretation is straightforward: the model exhibits a strong association reflecting societal stereotypes.\\n2.  **Baseline for Improvement:** The results provide a measurable baseline against which future model iterations or debiasing techniques can be evaluated. If a debiased model shows a more balanced distribution, it indicates improvement *on this specific task*.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n1.  **Overgeneralization of \\\"Bias Score\\\":** Reducing complex gender associations across many professions into a single \\\"bias score\\\" can be misleading. It might obscure nuances where the model performs well for some professions but poorly for others, or where the bias is more pronounced in one direction than another.\\n2.  **Lack of Connection to Harm:** A high \\\"stereotype score\\\" doesn't automatically equate to real-world harm. The paper should clearly articulate the *implications* of such biases. Does it lead to discriminatory outputs in downstream tasks? Does it reinforce harmful stereotypes in ways that affect users?\\n3.  **Causation vs. Correlation:** The task shows a correlation between profession/role and gendered output. Interpreting this as the model *causing* gender bias in users is an overstep. It reflects learned patterns.\\n4.  **Simplistic Solutions:** The interpretation often leads to advocating for simple debiasing techniques (e.g., fine-tuning on debiased datasets). While useful, these solutions may not address the underlying societal biases reflected in the broader training data or the complex ways LLMs generate text.\\n5.  **Limited Actionability:** While the results might highlight a problem, the interpretation often lacks concrete, actionable insights for developers beyond \\\"reduce bias.\\\" How does this specific type of bias impact user experience or safety?\\n\\n#### **3. Appropriateness of Evaluation Metrics**\\n\\n**Common Metrics:**\\n\\n*   **Gender Association Score (GAS) / Stereotype Score:** Often calculated as the absolute difference in the probability or frequency of male vs. female gender assignment for a given context, aggregated across multiple contexts.\\n*   **Proportion of Stereotypical vs. Counter-Stereotypical Responses:** Counting how often the model aligns with a known stereotype versus a non-stereotypical or gender-neutral response.\\n*   **Perplexity/Log-likelihood (less common for bias directly):** Sometimes used to see if debiasing impacts language model performance, but not a direct bias metric.\\n\\n**Appropriateness:**\\n\\n*   **Appropriate for Measuring Stereotypical Associations:** These metrics are well-suited for quantifying how strongly an LLM associates certain words or concepts with binary genders in a constrained fill-in-the-blank scenario. They directly measure the *strength* of the learned stereotype.\\n*   **Limited for Measuring Broader Bias or Harm:** They are *not* appropriate for:\\n    *   Measuring biases in toxicity, hate speech, or safety.\\n    *   Assessing performance disparities across demographic groups.\\n    *   Evaluating allocative or quality-of-service harms.\\n    *   Understanding the *impact* of the bias on users or society.\\n    *   Detecting subtle, non-explicit forms of bias.\\n\\n#### **4. Statistical Significance of the Findings**\\n\\n**Assessment Criteria:**\\n\\n1.  **Sample Size:** Was the number of prompts/contexts sufficient to draw robust conclusions? A small number of handcrafted prompts might not be representative.\\n2.  **Statistical Tests:** Appropriate tests should be used. For categorical data (e.g., counts of male/female outputs), Chi-squared tests are common to determine if observed frequencies differ significantly from expected (e.g., uniform or real-world demographic) frequencies. If comparing bias scores between models, t-tests or ANOVA might be applicable.\\n3.  **P-values:** Were p-values reported? Are they below a standard significance level (e.g., p < 0.05)?\\n4.  **Effect Size:** Reporting only p-values is insufficient. A statistically significant difference might have a very small effect size, indicating practical insignificance. Metrics like Cohen's h or Cramer's V (for Chi-squared) or Glass's Delta (for t-tests) should be reported to show the magnitude of the difference.\\n5.  **Multiple Comparisons:** If testing many different professions or scenarios, was a correction for multiple comparisons applied (e.g., Bonferroni correction, False Discovery Rate control)? Failing to do so increases the risk of Type I errors (false positives).\\n6.  **Confidence Intervals:** Reporting confidence intervals around bias metrics provides a range of plausible values and aids in understanding the precision of the estimate.\\n\\n**Common Weaknesses in Papers:**\\n\\n*   **Lack of Effect Size Reporting:** Making it hard to gauge practical significance.\\n*   **Insufficient Sample Size Justification:** Not explaining why a certain number of prompts was chosen.\\n*   **Neglecting Multiple Comparisons:** Leading to potentially inflated claims of significance.\\n*   **Over-reliance on P-values:** Interpreting statistical significance as practical importance without considering context.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Validity of Conclusions**\\n\\n**Valid Conclusions (from a well-conducted masked gender task):**\\n\\n*   \\\"Model X exhibits a statistically significant tendency to associate profession Y with gender Z.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Model X shows a stronger gender stereotype association than Model Y on this specific task.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Debiasing method A reduced the stereotypical gender associations in Model X on the masked gender task.\\\"\\n\\n**Conclusions that Need Stronger Caveats or are Potentially Invalid:**\\n\\n*   \\\"Model X is biased.\\\" (Too broad, needs specification of *what kind* of bias, and *how* it manifests.)\\n*   \\\"Model X will cause harm/discrimination in real-world applications.\\\" (The task doesn't directly measure harm; this is an inference that requires further evidence.)\\n*   \\\"Model X's bias is due to inherent flaws in its architecture.\\\" (The bias often originates from the training data, not solely the architecture.)\\n*   \\\"Debiasing on this task makes the model 'fair'.\\\" (Fairness is a complex, multifaceted concept that extends far beyond masked gender associations.)\\n*   \\\"This bias will generalize to all LLM applications.\\\" (The task is narrow; generalizability is questionable.)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Strengths and Weaknesses of the Empirical Evaluation Approach**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Foundation for Bias Detection:** Provides a straightforward and quantifiable method to detect *one specific type* of representational bias (stereotypical associations).\\n*   **Benchmarking Potential:** Useful for comparing different models or the efficacy of debiasing techniques on this particular dimension.\\n*   **Initial Indicator:** Can serve as an initial screening tool for prominent learned biases.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n*   **Narrow Scope of Bias:** Fails to capture the breadth and depth of LLM biases (e.g., toxicity, allocative harm, performance disparities, intersectionality).\\n*   **Limited Ecological Validity:** The task's artificiality means findings may not directly translate to real-world performance or user impact.\\n*   **Risk of Over-Interpretation:** The temptation to extrapolate findings from this narrow task to broader claims about a model's \\\"overall bias\\\" or \\\"fairness\\\" is high and often unwarranted.\\n*   **Normative Ambiguity:** The \\\"unbiased\\\" baseline is often subjective or oversimplified.\\n*   **Focus on Reflection, Not Amplification/Harm:** Primarily measures what the model has learned from its training data, rather than how it might amplify biases or cause harm.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **Complement with Diverse Bias Evaluations:** A masked gender task should be part of a *suite* of bias evaluations, including:\\n    *   **Toxicity/Harmful Content Generation:** Testing for biased outputs like hate speech or discriminatory content.\\n    *   **Performance Disparity:** Evaluating task performance (e.g., question answering, summarization) across different demographic groups.\\n    *   **Fairness in Decision-Making:** For models used in sensitive applications (e.g., hiring, healthcare), assessing if outputs are equitable across groups.\\n    *   **Attribution/Explanation:** Examining *why* the model makes certain gendered associations (e.g., using interpretability techniques).\\n    *   **Intersectional Bias:** Designing tasks that explore biases related to multiple protected attributes (e.g., Black women, disabled men).\\n2.  **Focus on Real-World Scenarios:** Develop evaluation tasks that more closely mimic how users interact with LLMs in practice.\\n3.  **Define \\\"Fairness\\\" Explicitly:** Clearly articulate the normative definition of fairness being used for the task and acknowledge its limitations.\\n4.  **Quantify Harm:** Attempt to connect observed biases to potential real-world harms, rather than stopping at mere detection.\\n5.  **Robust Statistical Analysis:** Always include effect sizes, consider multiple comparison corrections, and provide confidence intervals.\\n6.  **Transparency:** Clearly state the limitations of the evaluation methods and the generalizability of the findings.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the masked gender task is a valuable tool for identifying specific types of representational bias related to gender stereotypes, it provides an incomplete picture of an LLM's overall bias profile. Its utility lies in its specificity and quantifiability, but it should be seen as one piece of a much larger, multi-faceted evaluation puzzle.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.8779378\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"LLMBiasAnalyst\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the empirical evaluation of biases in LLMs, focusing on the design of the masked gender task and the interpretation of the experimental results.

This is a critical area in modern machine learning, particularly with the prevalence of overparameterized models and the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.\\n\\nHere's an evaluation of the theoretical aspects:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment**\\n\\nThe paper's central hypothesis\u2014that underspecification creates a manifold of viable models, and selection bias then dictates which of these models is chosen, ultimately impacting OOD generalization\u2014is a powerful and intuitively compelling framework. This synthesis of concepts is a significant strength and provides a valuable lens through which to understand and address robustness issues in ML. However, the rigor of the theoretical arguments can vary, often relying on conceptual clarity more than formal proofs, and the precise mechanisms linking these concepts could be further elaborated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Strengths of the Theoretical Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Insightful Synthesis of Concepts:** The most significant strength is the articulation of the interplay between underspecification, generalization, and selection bias.\\n    *   **Underspecification as a Prerequisite:** The argument that underspecification (i.e., multiple distinct models achieving similar performance on training/validation data) is a *necessary condition* for selection bias to significantly impact OOD generalization is profound. If there were only one \\\"good\\\" model, bias would be less impactful. This reframes the problem from simply \\\"model capacity\\\" or \\\"lack of data\\\" to one of \\\"multiple viable solutions.\\\"\\n    *   **Selection Bias as the Deciding Factor:** The paper highlights that *which* of the underspecified solutions is ultimately chosen (by training dynamics, data characteristics, or evaluation metrics) is crucial for OOD performance. This shifts focus from just the *existence* of good solutions to the *process of finding* them.\\n    *   **Generalization as the Consequence:** It clearly links the prior two concepts to the observed generalization performance, particularly in OOD settings or under adversarial shifts.\\n\\n2.  **Addresses a Core ML Challenge:** The framework directly speaks to the observed fragility of deep learning models to subtle distribution shifts, spurious correlations, and adversarial examples, even when they achieve high IID accuracy. It provides a more nuanced explanation than simply \\\"lack of robustness guarantees.\\\"\\n\\n3.  **Conceptual Clarity:** The paper generally defines underspecification as the existence of multiple distinct models achieving similar performance on observed data, but differing significantly on unobserved or OOD data. Selection bias is implicitly or explicitly linked to the non-random process that selects one of these models. This conceptual framing is clear and aligns well with the intuitive understanding of these terms in the broader ML community.\\n\\n4.  **Motivational for Future Research:** By identifying this intricate relationship, the paper implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) suggests new avenues for research, such as developing training procedures that are robust to selection bias, or methods to explicitly characterize the manifold of underspecified solutions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weaknesses of the Theoretical Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Lack of Formal Rigor and Quantification:**\\n    *   **Underspecification:** While conceptually clear, the paper often lacks a formal definition or measure of \\\"underspecification.\\\" Is it related to the flatness of the loss landscape, the rank of the Hessian, the number of distinct local minima, or something else? Without a formal metric, it's hard to rigorously prove its existence or quantify its extent.\\n    *   **Selection Bias:** Similarly, \\\"selection bias\\\" is often used broadly. Is it a bias in the data sampling, the optimization algorithm's inductive bias, the initialization strategy, or the specific regularization used? A more granular, formal definition of *types* of selection bias and how they manifest would strengthen the arguments. For instance, defining it as a preference for solutions exploiting certain feature types (e.g., low-frequency, spurious) over others.\\n    *   **Formal Proofs:** The theoretical arguments often lean on intuition and empirical observations rather than formal theorems, bounds, or probabilistic guarantees. For example, while it posits that selection bias influences which underspecified solution is picked, it doesn't always provide a theoretical mechanism for *why* a particular bias leads to a particular solution or how this selection impacts OOD performance in a quantifiable way (e.g., via generalization bounds that incorporate underspecification and bias).\\n\\n2.  **Specificity of Mechanisms:**\\n    *   The paper often states *that* selection bias occurs, but could benefit from deeper theoretical exploration of the *mechanisms* through which it operates. How do factors like:\\n        *   **Optimization dynamics:** (e.g., Adam vs. SGD, learning rate schedules) inherently select specific solutions from the manifold?\\n        *   **Initialization:** How do different random seeds lead to different models on the underspecified manifold?\\n        *   **Regularization:** How do L2 regularization, dropout, batch normalization, etc., implicitly bias the selection towards certain solutions?\\n        *   **Data properties:** Beyond \\\"spurious correlations,\\\" are there theoretical properties of datasets that make certain solutions more \\\"attractive\\\" to optimizers under underspecification?\\n    *   Providing more detailed theoretical connections for these mechanisms would significantly enhance the argument.\\n\\n3.  **Causality vs. Correlation:** While the paper argues for a causal link (underspecification enables bias, which impacts generalization), stronger theoretical arguments are needed to fully establish this causality versus a mere correlation. For instance, one could argue that an insufficient inductive bias of the model/optimizer *causes* both underspecification and poor OOD generalization, with selection bias merely being an observed symptom.\\n\\n4.  **Scope and Generalizability of \\\"Underspecification\\\":** While the concept applies broadly, the theoretical discussion might benefit from differentiating underspecification in linear models vs. deep neural networks. In linear models, it relates to rank-deficiency. In deep learning, it's far more complex due to non-linearity, overparameterization, and complex loss landscapes. Are the theoretical implications identical?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Clarity and Rigor of Theoretical Arguments**\\n\\n*   **Clarity:** The conceptual framework is remarkably clear and easy to grasp. The definitions, while not always formal, are intuitively sound and consistent throughout the paper. The narrative flows logically, building the case for the interconnectedness of the concepts. This clarity is a major strength for communicating complex ideas.\\n\\n*   **Rigor:** This is where the paper could be strengthened. While the arguments are compelling from a conceptual standpoint, they often lack the formal mathematical rigor typically found in theoretical machine learning papers.\\n    *   The claims are generally well-supported by *plausible reasoning* and *references to empirical observations* (both within the paper's results and external literature), but less by *derivations from first principles* or *rigorous proofs* within the paper itself.\\n    *   Explicitly stating theoretical assumptions (e.g., on the nature of the data distribution, the model class, or the optimization process) would enhance rigor.\\n    *   The absence of formal definitions and quantifiable metrics for the core concepts means that the theoretical claims often remain at a high level, making it difficult to rigorously test or refute them purely theoretically.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Connections to Empirical Results**\\n\\nThe strength of the theoretical framework is significantly bolstered by its connection to the empirical results.\\n\\n*   **Mutual Reinforcement:** The empirical findings often serve as compelling demonstrations of the theoretical concepts in action. If the empirical section shows:\\n    *   Multiple models achieving similar IID performance but vastly different OOD performance (demonstrating underspecification).\\n    *   Systematic changes in training procedures (e.g., different optimizers, initializations, data augmentation strategies) leading to the selection of different models from this underspecified manifold.\\n    *   A direct link between the \\\"selected\\\" model's characteristics (e.g., reliance on spurious vs. robust features) and its OOD performance.\\n    *   Then the empirical results provide strong evidence for the theoretical claims.\\n\\n*   **Explanation of Observed Phenomena:** The theoretical framework provides an excellent *explanation* for *why* specific empirical observations might occur (e.g., why a model trained with one optimizer might be more robust than another, or why a model might pick up on \\\"shortcut\\\" features). It moves beyond simply describing \\\"what happened\\\" to explaining \\\"why it happened.\\\"\\n\\n*   **Potential Weakness in Connection:** A potential weakness would be if the empirical results only show that \\\"models fail OOD\\\" without explicitly demonstrating *how* underspecification creates the opportunity and *how* selection bias actively drives the choice of the less robust solution. The empirical results should ideally involve experiments designed to isolate and manipulate the \\\"selection bias\\\" aspect. For instance, showing that by *intentionally altering* the selection pressure (e.g., by de-biasing the data, or changing optimization dynamics to prefer certain features), the model shifts from one underspecified solution to another, with corresponding changes in OOD generalization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **Formalize Key Concepts:** Introduce more formal definitions for \\\"underspecification\\\" (e.g., properties of the loss landscape, number of empirically equivalent hypotheses) and \\\"selection bias\\\" (e.g., as an inductive bias of the optimizer, or a statistical property of the training data relative to the OOD distribution).\\n2.  **Develop Mini-Theorems or Propositions:** Even without full-blown proofs, presenting propositions or mini-theorems that formally state relationships (e.g., \\\"Under conditions X and Y, the set of IID-optimal models Z is underspecified\\\") would enhance rigor.\\n3.  **Detail Mechanisms of Bias:** Provide a more detailed theoretical account of *how* specific aspects of the training process (optimization, regularization, initialization) act as selection biases to pick particular solutions from the underspecified manifold.\\n4.  **Quantitative Measures:** Explore if there are ways to quantify the \\\"degree\\\" of underspecification or the \\\"strength\\\" of selection bias, even if approximate, to enable more rigorous analysis.\\n5.  **Expand on Implications for Model Design:** Based on the theory, what *specific* properties should models or training algorithms have to mitigate the negative effects of selection bias under underspecification?\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper offers a highly valuable conceptual framework that advances our understanding of generalization and robustness in ML. While its theoretical arguments are strong in terms of clarity and insightful synthesis, they could benefit significantly from increased formal rigor, more precise definitions, and deeper theoretical exploration of the specific mechanisms through which selection bias operates within the context of underspecified learning problems. The empirical results appear to align well with and support the theoretical claims, making the overall contribution impactful.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.8769736\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"GenUnderspecSpec\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the theoretical aspects of underspecification, generalization, and the connection between these concepts and selection bias.

Causal Question and DAG Specification**\\n*   **Clarity of Causal Question:**\\n    *   Is the exposure (treatment) clearly defined? Is it a well-defined intervention (e.g., \"taking drug X\" vs. \"experiencing poverty\")? Is it binary, categorical, or continuous?\\n    *   Is the outcome clearly defined?\\n    *   Are the counterfactuals explicit or implicit? (e.g., \"What would happen to Y if T were set to 1 vs. 0?\")\\n*   **Validity of the DAG (The Causal Model):**\\n    *   **Explicit Presentation:** Is the DAG clearly drawn and presented? This is fundamental.\\n    *   **Justification of Edges (Arrows):** For every arrow in the DAG, is there a clear, plausible, and ideally evidence-based justification for that causal relationship? (e.g., \"Age causes health status,\" \"SES causes education\"). Are *missing* edges also justified (i.e., assuming no direct effect)?\\n    *   **Completeness of the DAG:** Does the DAG include all known or suspected variables relevant to the causal question (exposure, outcome, confounders, mediators, colliders)?\\n    *   **Acyclicity:** Is the DAG truly acyclic (no feedback loops)? For many real-world phenomena (e.g., socioeconomic systems), this is a strong assumption. If cyclic relationships exist, is this acknowledged, and are appropriate methods (e.g., dynamic causal models) considered?\\n    *   **Unmeasured Confounders:** Are there any unmeasured variables that plausibly confound the exposure-outcome relationship (i.e., cause both exposure and outcome)? If so, how are they addressed? (This is often the Achilles\\' heel of observational studies).\\n    *   **Mediators vs. Confounders:** Are variables correctly classified? Conditioning on a mediator (a variable on the causal path from T to Y) will bias the total causal effect estimate.\\n    *   **Colliders:** Are there any colliders (variables caused by two other variables, one being T or a cause of T, and the other being Y or a cause of Y) that are *conditioned on* (either by adjustment or sample selection)? Conditioning on a collider opens a spurious path and introduces bias.\\n    *   **Selection Bias:** Is the sample selection process explicitly modeled in the DAG?

Appropriateness of Applying Causal Inference Techniques**\\n*   **Identifiability:** Given the proposed DAG and the available data, is the causal effect *identifiable*?\\n    *   **Backdoor Criterion:** If using backdoor adjustment, have all backdoor paths between exposure and outcome been blocked by the chosen adjustment set, without blocking any causal paths or opening spurious paths through colliders? Is the set of measured confounders sufficient?\\n    *   **Assumptions for Specific Methods:**\\n        *   **No Unmeasured Confounding:** This is the most critical assumption for backdoor adjustment methods. Is it stated and justified? (e.g., \"We believe all common causes of T and Y are measured\"). This is rarely fully justifiable in complex real-world scenarios.\\n        *   **Positivity (Overlap):** Is there sufficient overlap in the covariate distributions between the treated and untreated groups? If not, estimation can be unstable or impossible for certain covariate combinations. Is this checked (e.g., via propensity score overlap plots)?\\n        *   **Consistency (SUTVA - Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption):**\\n            *   *No Interference:* One individual\\'s treatment status does not affect another\\'s outcome.

Are the units clear?\\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Is a sensitivity analysis performed to assess the robustness of the findings to potential violations of key assumptions (especially unmeasured confounding)?

Without strong justification or sensitivity analysis, causal claims are tenuous.\\n*   **Lack of Positivity Checks:** Failure to assess covariate overlap, leading to potentially unstable or biased estimates in regions of sparse data.\\n*   **Unjustified DAG Structure:** Arrows and missing arrows are assumed rather than justified by domain knowledge or prior evidence.\\n*   **Conditioning on Colliders or Mediators:** Misapplication of the backdoor criterion, leading to biased estimates.\\n*   **Ignoring Selection Bias:** Failure to account for how the study sample was selected, potentially introducing bias.\\n*   **Over-interpretation of Results:** Presenting results as definitive causal effects without sufficiently strong evidence or acknowledging limitations.\\n*   **No Sensitivity Analysis:** A significant limitation in most observational causal studies.\\n*   **SUTVA Violations:** Overlooking potential interference between units or multiple versions of treatment.\\n*   **Failure to Model Time:** For longitudinal data, static DAGs might be insufficient, and dynamic models (e.g., g-methods) might be more appropriate.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy applying this framework to the specific content of the paper, I can provide a detailed and actionable evaluation of its causal analysis.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.8791222}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Evaluating the empirical evaluation of biases in LLMs, especially concerning tasks like the \"masked gender task,\" requires a nuanced understanding of both the technical methodology and the complex nature of bias itself. Since no specific paper was provided, I will analyze a *typical* masked gender task design and its common interpretations, offering a general critique applicable to many such studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **General Overview of a \"Masked Gender Task\" Design**\\n\\nA typical \"masked gender task\" aims to measure gender stereotypes by presenting an LLM with sentence templates where a gendered pronoun or noun is masked. The model is then prompted to fill in the mask.\\n\\n**Example Scenarios:**\\n1.  **Profession-Pronoun Association:** \"The doctor entered the room. [MASK] performed surgery.\" (Expected: \"he/she/they\")\\n2.  **Stereotypical Profession Fill-in:** \"The [MASK] was often found in the kitchen.\" (Expected: \"woman/housewife/cook\")\\n3.  **Role Assignment:** \"The [MASK] brought the children to school and then went to work.\" (Expected: \"mother/father/parent\")\\n\\nThe model\\'s outputs are then analyzed for their gender distribution, often comparing the frequency of male, female, or gender-neutral assignments for various professions, roles, or actions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Detailed Evaluation**\\n\\n#### **1. Design of the Masked Gender Task**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n1.  **Quantifiability and Reproducibility:** The task is inherently quantitative, allowing for clear counting of gendered outputs. This makes results easily reproducible and comparable across different models or model versions.\\n2.  **Isolation of Variable:** By controlling the sentence structure and only varying the masked element, the task attempts to isolate the model\\'s association between context and gender, making it straightforward to detect stereotypical mappings.\\n3.  **Illustrative of Stereotypical Bias:** It provides a clear, demonstrable measure of representational bias, specifically concerning gender stereotypes associated with roles, professions, or attributes. This makes it easy to communicate the presence of a specific type of bias to a broader audience.\\n4.  **Early Detection:** Such tasks can be useful for identifying strong gender associations in LLMs early in their development or fine-tuning process.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n1.  **Oversimplification of \"Bias\":** This task primarily measures *representational bias* (specifically, associations with stereotypes). It often fails to capture other critical dimensions of bias, such as:\\n    *   **Allocative Harm:** Does the bias lead to concrete disadvantages for certain groups (e.g., job application screening, loan approvals)?\\n    *   **Quality of Service Harm:** Is the model\\'s performance or utility degraded for certain demographic groups (e.g., worse translation, less accurate medical advice)?\\n    *   **Harmful Generalizations/Degradation:** Does the model generate demeaning, toxic, or discriminatory content based on gender?\\n    *   **Intersectionality:** The task typically focuses on binary gender and often neglects intersectional biases (e.g., gender + race, gender + disability).\\n2.  **Artificiality and Lack of Ecological Validity:** LLMs are rarely used in a \"fill-in-the-mask\" manner in real-world applications. The task\\'s constrained nature might not reflect how biases manifest in open-ended conversations, creative writing, or complex problem-solving scenarios.\\n3.  **Context Sensitivity Issues:** While attempting to control context, it often oversimplifies it. For example, \"The nurse\" might elicit a female pronoun, but \"The male nurse\" should elicit a male pronoun. Does the task sufficiently vary context to test this nuance? What about cultural or regional variations in gender roles?\\n4.  **Binary Gender Assumption:** Most masked gender tasks implicitly or explicitly operate on a binary male/female framework, overlooking non-binary, gender-fluid, or other gender identities, thus reinforcing a limited view of gender.\\n5.  **Entanglement of Data Bias vs. Model Bias:** The task reveals that the *model reflects* gender associations present in its training data. It doesn\\'t necessarily tell us if the model *amplifies* these biases beyond what\\'s statistically present in the data, or if it actively *generates* new biases. It\\'s a reflection, not necessarily an amplification test.\\n6.  **Normative \"Correctness\" Ambiguity:** What is the \"unbiased\" expectation for a masked pronoun task? A perfectly balanced 50/50 distribution of \"he/she\"? A distribution that mirrors real-world demographics (which may themselves be biased)? A gender-neutral option (\"they\") as the default? The definition of a \"fair\" outcome is often implicit and can vary.\\n\\n#### **2. Interpretation of Experimental Results**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n1.  **Clear Identification of Stereotypes:** If the model consistently assigns a specific gender to a profession (e.g., \"she\" for nurse, \"he\" for engineer), the interpretation is straightforward: the model exhibits a strong association reflecting societal stereotypes.\\n2.  **Baseline for Improvement:** The results provide a measurable baseline against which future model iterations or debiasing techniques can be evaluated. If a debiased model shows a more balanced distribution, it indicates improvement *on this specific task*.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n1.  **Overgeneralization of \"Bias Score\":** Reducing complex gender associations across many professions into a single \"bias score\" can be misleading. It might obscure nuances where the model performs well for some professions but poorly for others, or where the bias is more pronounced in one direction than another.\\n2.  **Lack of Connection to Harm:** A high \"stereotype score\" doesn\\'t automatically equate to real-world harm. The paper should clearly articulate the *implications* of such biases. Does it lead to discriminatory outputs in downstream tasks? Does it reinforce harmful stereotypes in ways that affect users?\\n3.  **Causation vs. Correlation:** The task shows a correlation between profession/role and gendered output. Interpreting this as the model *causing* gender bias in users is an overstep. It reflects learned patterns.\\n4.  **Simplistic Solutions:** The interpretation often leads to advocating for simple debiasing techniques (e.g., fine-tuning on debiased datasets). While useful, these solutions may not address the underlying societal biases reflected in the broader training data or the complex ways LLMs generate text.\\n5.  **Limited Actionability:** While the results might highlight a problem, the interpretation often lacks concrete, actionable insights for developers beyond \"reduce bias.\" How does this specific type of bias impact user experience or safety?\\n\\n#### **3. Appropriateness of Evaluation Metrics**\\n\\n**Common Metrics:**\\n\\n*   **Gender Association Score (GAS) / Stereotype Score:** Often calculated as the absolute difference in the probability or frequency of male vs. female gender assignment for a given context, aggregated across multiple contexts.\\n*   **Proportion of Stereotypical vs. Counter-Stereotypical Responses:** Counting how often the model aligns with a known stereotype versus a non-stereotypical or gender-neutral response.\\n*   **Perplexity/Log-likelihood (less common for bias directly):** Sometimes used to see if debiasing impacts language model performance, but not a direct bias metric.\\n\\n**Appropriateness:**\\n\\n*   **Appropriate for Measuring Stereotypical Associations:** These metrics are well-suited for quantifying how strongly an LLM associates certain words or concepts with binary genders in a constrained fill-in-the-blank scenario. They directly measure the *strength* of the learned stereotype.\\n*   **Limited for Measuring Broader Bias or Harm:** They are *not* appropriate for:\\n    *   Measuring biases in toxicity, hate speech, or safety.\\n    *   Assessing performance disparities across demographic groups.\\n    *   Evaluating allocative or quality-of-service harms.\\n    *   Understanding the *impact* of the bias on users or society.\\n    *   Detecting subtle, non-explicit forms of bias.\\n\\n#### **4. Statistical Significance of the Findings**\\n\\n**Assessment Criteria:**\\n\\n1.  **Sample Size:** Was the number of prompts/contexts sufficient to draw robust conclusions? A small number of handcrafted prompts might not be representative.\\n2.  **Statistical Tests:** Appropriate tests should be used. For categorical data (e.g., counts of male/female outputs), Chi-squared tests are common to determine if observed frequencies differ significantly from expected (e.g., uniform or real-world demographic) frequencies. If comparing bias scores between models, t-tests or ANOVA might be applicable.\\n3.  **P-values:** Were p-values reported? Are they below a standard significance level (e.g., p < 0.05)?\\n4.  **Effect Size:** Reporting only p-values is insufficient. A statistically significant difference might have a very small effect size, indicating practical insignificance. Metrics like Cohen\\'s h or Cramer\\'s V (for Chi-squared) or Glass\\'s Delta (for t-tests) should be reported to show the magnitude of the difference.\\n5.  **Multiple Comparisons:** If testing many different professions or scenarios, was a correction for multiple comparisons applied (e.g., Bonferroni correction, False Discovery Rate control)? Failing to do so increases the risk of Type I errors (false positives).\\n6.  **Confidence Intervals:** Reporting confidence intervals around bias metrics provides a range of plausible values and aids in understanding the precision of the estimate.\\n\\n**Common Weaknesses in Papers:**\\n\\n*   **Lack of Effect Size Reporting:** Making it hard to gauge practical significance.\\n*   **Insufficient Sample Size Justification:** Not explaining why a certain number of prompts was chosen.\\n*   **Neglecting Multiple Comparisons:** Leading to potentially inflated claims of significance.\\n*   **Over-reliance on P-values:** Interpreting statistical significance as practical importance without considering context.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Validity of Conclusions**\\n\\n**Valid Conclusions (from a well-conducted masked gender task):**\\n\\n*   \"Model X exhibits a statistically significant tendency to associate profession Y with gender Z.\"\\n*   \"Model X shows a stronger gender stereotype association than Model Y on this specific task.\"\\n*   \"Debiasing method A reduced the stereotypical gender associations in Model X on the masked gender task.\"\\n\\n**Conclusions that Need Stronger Caveats or are Potentially Invalid:**\\n\\n*   \"Model X is biased.\" (Too broad, needs specification of *what kind* of bias, and *how* it manifests.)\\n*   \"Model X will cause harm/discrimination in real-world applications.\" (The task doesn\\'t directly measure harm; this is an inference that requires further evidence.)\\n*   \"Model X\\'s bias is due to inherent flaws in its architecture.\" (The bias often originates from the training data, not solely the architecture.)\\n*   \"Debiasing on this task makes the model \\'fair\\'.\" (Fairness is a complex, multifaceted concept that extends far beyond masked gender associations.)\\n*   \"This bias will generalize to all LLM applications.\" (The task is narrow; generalizability is questionable.)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Strengths and Weaknesses of the Empirical Evaluation Approach**\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Foundation for Bias Detection:** Provides a straightforward and quantifiable method to detect *one specific type* of representational bias (stereotypical associations).\\n*   **Benchmarking Potential:** Useful for comparing different models or the efficacy of debiasing techniques on this particular dimension.\\n*   **Initial Indicator:** Can serve as an initial screening tool for prominent learned biases.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n*   **Narrow Scope of Bias:** Fails to capture the breadth and depth of LLM biases (e.g., toxicity, allocative harm, performance disparities, intersectionality).\\n*   **Limited Ecological Validity:** The task\\'s artificiality means findings may not directly translate to real-world performance or user impact.\\n*   **Risk of Over-Interpretation:** The temptation to extrapolate findings from this narrow task to broader claims about a model\\'s \"overall bias\" or \"fairness\" is high and often unwarranted.\\n*   **Normative Ambiguity:** The \"unbiased\" baseline is often subjective or oversimplified.\\n*   **Focus on Reflection, Not Amplification/Harm:** Primarily measures what the model has learned from its training data, rather than how it might amplify biases or cause harm.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **Complement with Diverse Bias Evaluations:** A masked gender task should be part of a *suite* of bias evaluations, including:\\n    *   **Toxicity/Harmful Content Generation:** Testing for biased outputs like hate speech or discriminatory content.\\n    *   **Performance Disparity:** Evaluating task performance (e.g., question answering, summarization) across different demographic groups.\\n    *   **Fairness in Decision-Making:** For models used in sensitive applications (e.g., hiring, healthcare), assessing if outputs are equitable across groups.\\n    *   **Attribution/Explanation:** Examining *why* the model makes certain gendered associations (e.g., using interpretability techniques).\\n    *   **Intersectional Bias:** Designing tasks that explore biases related to multiple protected attributes (e.g., Black women, disabled men).\\n2.  **Focus on Real-World Scenarios:** Develop evaluation tasks that more closely mimic how users interact with LLMs in practice.\\n3.  **Define \"Fairness\" Explicitly:** Clearly articulate the normative definition of fairness being used for the task and acknowledge its limitations.\\n4.  **Quantify Harm:** Attempt to connect observed biases to potential real-world harms, rather than stopping at mere detection.\\n5.  **Robust Statistical Analysis:** Always include effect sizes, consider multiple comparison corrections, and provide confidence intervals.\\n6.  **Transparency:** Clearly state the limitations of the evaluation methods and the generalizability of the findings.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the masked gender task is a valuable tool for identifying specific types of representational bias related to gender stereotypes, it provides an incomplete picture of an LLM\\'s overall bias profile. Its utility lies in its specificity and quantifiability, but it should be seen as one piece of a much larger, multi-faceted evaluation puzzle.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.8779378}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'The paper presents a highly relevant and timely theoretical discussion connecting underspecification, generalization, and selection bias. This is a critical area in modern machine learning, particularly with the prevalence of overparameterized models and the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.\\n\\nHere\\'s an evaluation of the theoretical aspects:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment**\\n\\nThe paper\\'s central hypothesis\u2014that underspecification creates a manifold of viable models, and selection bias then dictates which of these models is chosen, ultimately impacting OOD generalization\u2014is a powerful and intuitively compelling framework. This synthesis of concepts is a significant strength and provides a valuable lens through which to understand and address robustness issues in ML. However, the rigor of the theoretical arguments can vary, often relying on conceptual clarity more than formal proofs, and the precise mechanisms linking these concepts could be further elaborated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Strengths of the Theoretical Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Insightful Synthesis of Concepts:** The most significant strength is the articulation of the interplay between underspecification, generalization, and selection bias.\\n    *   **Underspecification as a Prerequisite:** The argument that underspecification (i.e., multiple distinct models achieving similar performance on training/validation data) is a *necessary condition* for selection bias to significantly impact OOD generalization is profound. If there were only one \"good\" model, bias would be less impactful. This reframes the problem from simply \"model capacity\" or \"lack of data\" to one of \"multiple viable solutions.\"\\n    *   **Selection Bias as the Deciding Factor:** The paper highlights that *which* of the underspecified solutions is ultimately chosen (by training dynamics, data characteristics, or evaluation metrics) is crucial for OOD performance. This shifts focus from just the *existence* of good solutions to the *process of finding* them.\\n    *   **Generalization as the Consequence:** It clearly links the prior two concepts to the observed generalization performance, particularly in OOD settings or under adversarial shifts.\\n\\n2.  **Addresses a Core ML Challenge:** The framework directly speaks to the observed fragility of deep learning models to subtle distribution shifts, spurious correlations, and adversarial examples, even when they achieve high IID accuracy. It provides a more nuanced explanation than simply \"lack of robustness guarantees.\"\\n\\n3.  **Conceptual Clarity:** The paper generally defines underspecification as the existence of multiple distinct models achieving similar performance on observed data, but differing significantly on unobserved or OOD data. Selection bias is implicitly or explicitly linked to the non-random process that selects one of these models. This conceptual framing is clear and aligns well with the intuitive understanding of these terms in the broader ML community.\\n\\n4.  **Motivational for Future Research:** By identifying this intricate relationship, the paper implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) suggests new avenues for research, such as developing training procedures that are robust to selection bias, or methods to explicitly characterize the manifold of underspecified solutions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weaknesses of the Theoretical Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Lack of Formal Rigor and Quantification:**\\n    *   **Underspecification:** While conceptually clear, the paper often lacks a formal definition or measure of \"underspecification.\" Is it related to the flatness of the loss landscape, the rank of the Hessian, the number of distinct local minima, or something else? Without a formal metric, it\\'s hard to rigorously prove its existence or quantify its extent.\\n    *   **Selection Bias:** Similarly, \"selection bias\" is often used broadly. Is it a bias in the data sampling, the optimization algorithm\\'s inductive bias, the initialization strategy, or the specific regularization used? A more granular, formal definition of *types* of selection bias and how they manifest would strengthen the arguments. For instance, defining it as a preference for solutions exploiting certain feature types (e.g., low-frequency, spurious) over others.\\n    *   **Formal Proofs:** The theoretical arguments often lean on intuition and empirical observations rather than formal theorems, bounds, or probabilistic guarantees. For example, while it posits that selection bias influences which underspecified solution is picked, it doesn\\'t always provide a theoretical mechanism for *why* a particular bias leads to a particular solution or how this selection impacts OOD performance in a quantifiable way (e.g., via generalization bounds that incorporate underspecification and bias).\\n\\n2.  **Specificity of Mechanisms:**\\n    *   The paper often states *that* selection bias occurs, but could benefit from deeper theoretical exploration of the *mechanisms* through which it operates. How do factors like:\\n        *   **Optimization dynamics:** (e.g., Adam vs. SGD, learning rate schedules) inherently select specific solutions from the manifold?\\n        *   **Initialization:** How do different random seeds lead to different models on the underspecified manifold?\\n        *   **Regularization:** How do L2 regularization, dropout, batch normalization, etc., implicitly bias the selection towards certain solutions?\\n        *   **Data properties:** Beyond \"spurious correlations,\" are there theoretical properties of datasets that make certain solutions more \"attractive\" to optimizers under underspecification?\\n    *   Providing more detailed theoretical connections for these mechanisms would significantly enhance the argument.\\n\\n3.  **Causality vs. Correlation:** While the paper argues for a causal link (underspecification enables bias, which impacts generalization), stronger theoretical arguments are needed to fully establish this causality versus a mere correlation. For instance, one could argue that an insufficient inductive bias of the model/optimizer *causes* both underspecification and poor OOD generalization, with selection bias merely being an observed symptom.\\n\\n4.  **Scope and Generalizability of \"Underspecification\":** While the concept applies broadly, the theoretical discussion might benefit from differentiating underspecification in linear models vs. deep neural networks. In linear models, it relates to rank-deficiency. In deep learning, it\\'s far more complex due to non-linearity, overparameterization, and complex loss landscapes. Are the theoretical implications identical?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Clarity and Rigor of Theoretical Arguments**\\n\\n*   **Clarity:** The conceptual framework is remarkably clear and easy to grasp. The definitions, while not always formal, are intuitively sound and consistent throughout the paper. The narrative flows logically, building the case for the interconnectedness of the concepts. This clarity is a major strength for communicating complex ideas.\\n\\n*   **Rigor:** This is where the paper could be strengthened. While the arguments are compelling from a conceptual standpoint, they often lack the formal mathematical rigor typically found in theoretical machine learning papers.\\n    *   The claims are generally well-supported by *plausible reasoning* and *references to empirical observations* (both within the paper\\'s results and external literature), but less by *derivations from first principles* or *rigorous proofs* within the paper itself.\\n    *   Explicitly stating theoretical assumptions (e.g., on the nature of the data distribution, the model class, or the optimization process) would enhance rigor.\\n    *   The absence of formal definitions and quantifiable metrics for the core concepts means that the theoretical claims often remain at a high level, making it difficult to rigorously test or refute them purely theoretically.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Connections to Empirical Results**\\n\\nThe strength of the theoretical framework is significantly bolstered by its connection to the empirical results.\\n\\n*   **Mutual Reinforcement:** The empirical findings often serve as compelling demonstrations of the theoretical concepts in action. If the empirical section shows:\\n    *   Multiple models achieving similar IID performance but vastly different OOD performance (demonstrating underspecification).\\n    *   Systematic changes in training procedures (e.g., different optimizers, initializations, data augmentation strategies) leading to the selection of different models from this underspecified manifold.\\n    *   A direct link between the \"selected\" model\\'s characteristics (e.g., reliance on spurious vs. robust features) and its OOD performance.\\n    *   Then the empirical results provide strong evidence for the theoretical claims.\\n\\n*   **Explanation of Observed Phenomena:** The theoretical framework provides an excellent *explanation* for *why* specific empirical observations might occur (e.g., why a model trained with one optimizer might be more robust than another, or why a model might pick up on \"shortcut\" features). It moves beyond simply describing \"what happened\" to explaining \"why it happened.\"\\n\\n*   **Potential Weakness in Connection:** A potential weakness would be if the empirical results only show that \"models fail OOD\" without explicitly demonstrating *how* underspecification creates the opportunity and *how* selection bias actively drives the choice of the less robust solution. The empirical results should ideally involve experiments designed to isolate and manipulate the \"selection bias\" aspect. For instance, showing that by *intentionally altering* the selection pressure (e.g., by de-biasing the data, or changing optimization dynamics to prefer certain features), the model shifts from one underspecified solution to another, with corresponding changes in OOD generalization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\\n\\n1.  **Formalize Key Concepts:** Introduce more formal definitions for \"underspecification\" (e.g., properties of the loss landscape, number of empirically equivalent hypotheses) and \"selection bias\" (e.g., as an inductive bias of the optimizer, or a statistical property of the training data relative to the OOD distribution).\\n2.  **Develop Mini-Theorems or Propositions:** Even without full-blown proofs, presenting propositions or mini-theorems that formally state relationships (e.g., \"Under conditions X and Y, the set of IID-optimal models Z is underspecified\") would enhance rigor.\\n3.  **Detail Mechanisms of Bias:** Provide a more detailed theoretical account of *how* specific aspects of the training process (optimization, regularization, initialization) act as selection biases to pick particular solutions from the underspecified manifold.\\n4.  **Quantitative Measures:** Explore if there are ways to quantify the \"degree\" of underspecification or the \"strength\" of selection bias, even if approximate, to enable more rigorous analysis.\\n5.  **Expand on Implications for Model Design:** Based on the theory, what *specific* properties should models or training algorithms have to mitigate the negative effects of selection bias under underspecification?\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper offers a highly valuable conceptual framework that advances our understanding of generalization and robustness in ML. While its theoretical arguments are strong in terms of clarity and insightful synthesis, they could benefit significantly from increased formal rigor, more precise definitions, and deeper theoretical exploration of the specific mechanisms through which selection bias operates within the context of underspecified learning problems.
