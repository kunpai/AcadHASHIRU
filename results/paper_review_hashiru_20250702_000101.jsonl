The paper title is: Estimating individual treatment effects under unobserved confounding using binary instruments\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Individual treatment effects (ITEs) are relevant across many disciplines such as marketing (Varian, 2016) and personalized medicine (Yazdani & Boerwinkle, 2015). Knowledge about ITEs provides insights into the heterogeneity of treatment effects, and thus help in potentially better treatment decisions. Many recent works that use machine learning to estimate ITEs are based on the assumption of unconfoundedness (Alaa & van der Schaar, 2017; Lim et al., 2018; Shalit et al., 2017; Wager & Athey, 2018), In practice, however, this assumption is often violated because it is common that some confounders are not reported in the data. Typical examples are race, income, gender, or the socioeconomic status of patients, which are not stored in medical files. If the confounding is sufficiently strong, standard methods for estimating ITEs suffer from confounding bias (Pearl, 2009), which may lead to inferior treatment decisions. To handle unobserved confounders, instrumental variables (IVs) can be leveraged to relax the assumption of unconfoundedness and still compute reliable ITE estimates. IV methods were originally developed in economics (Wright, 1928), but, only recently, there is a growing interest in combining IV methods with machine learning (see Sec. 3). Importantly, IV methods outperform classical ITE estimators if a sufficient amount of confounding is not observed (Hartford et al., 2017). We thus aim at estimating ITEs from observational data under unobserved confounding using IVs. In this paper, we consider the setting where a single binary instrument is available. This setting is widespread in personalized medicine (and other applications such as marketing or public policy) (Bloom et al., 1997). In fact, the setting is encountered in essentially all observational or randomized studies with observed non-compliance (Imbens & Angrist, 1994). As an example, consider a randomized controlled trial (RCT), where treatments are randomly assigned to patients and their outcomes are observed. Due to some potentially unobserved confounders (e.g., income, education), some patients refuse to take the treatment initially assigned to them. Here, the treatment assignment serves as a binary IV. Moreover, such RCTs have been widely used by public decision-makers, e.g., to analyze the effect of health insurance on health outcome (see the so-called Oregon health insurance experiment) (Finkelstein et al., 2012) or the effect of military service on lifetime earnings (Angrist, 1990). We propose a novel machine learning framework (called MRIV) for estimating ITEs using binary IVs. Our framework takes an initial ITE estimator and nuisance parameter estimators as input to perform a pseudo-outcome regression. Importantly, our framework uses a multiply robust parametrization of the efficient influence function as pseudo outcome. We provide a theoretical analysis, where we use tools from Kennedy (2022) to show that our framework achieves a multiply robust convergence rate, i.e., our MRIV converges with a fast rate even if several nuisance parameters converge slowly. We further show that, compared to existing plug-in IV methods, the performance of our framework is asymptotically superior. Finally, we leverage our framework and, on top of it, build a tailored deep neural network called MRIV-Net. Differences to existing literature: Our framework is multiply robust1, i.e., we show that it is consistent in the union of three different model specifications. This is different from existing methods for ITE estimation using IVs such as Okui et al. (2012), Syrgkanis et al. (2019), or plug-in estimators (Bargagli-Stoffi et al., 2021; Imbens & Angrist, 1994). Contributions: (1) We propose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework (called MRIV) to learn the ITE using the binary IV setting. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first that is shown to be multiply robust, i.e., consistent in the union of three model specifications. For comparison, existing works for ITE estimation only show double robustness (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018; Syrgkanis et al., 2019). (2) We prove that MRIV achieves a multiply robust convergence rate. This is different to methods for IV settings which do not provide robust convergence rates (Syrgkanis et al., 2019). We further show that our MRIV is asymptotically superior to existing plug-in estimators. (3) We propose a tailored deep neural network, called MRIV-Net, which builds upon our framework to estimate ITEs. We demonstrate that MRIV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. 2 PROBLEM SETUP: Data generating process: We observe data D = (xi, zi, ai, yi)ni=1 consisting of n \u2208 N observations of the tuple (X,Z,A, Y ). Here, X \u2208 X are observed confounders, Z \u2208 {0, 1} is a binary instrument, A \u2208 {0, 1} is a binary treatment, and Y \u2208 R is an outcome of interest. Furthermore, we assume the existence of unobserved confounders U \u2208 U , which affect both the treatment A and the outcome Y . The causal graph is shown in Fig. 1. Applicability: Our proposed framework is widely applicable in practice, namely to all settings with the above data generating process. This includes both (1) observational data and (2) RCTs with non-compliance. For (1), observational data is commonly encountered in, e.g., personalized medicine. Here, modeling treatments as binary variables is consistent with previous literature on causal effect estimation and standard in medical practice (Robins et al., 2000). For (2), our setting is further encountered in RCTs when the instrument Z is a randomized treatment assignment but individuals do not comply with their treatment assignment. Such RCTs have been extensively used by public decision-makers, e.g., to analyze the effect of health insurance on health outcome (Finkelstein et al., 2012) or the effect of military service on lifetime earnings (Angrist, 1990). We build upon the potential outcomes framework (Rubin, 1974) for modeling causal effects. Let Y (a, z) denote the potential outcome that would have been observed under A = a and Z = z. Following previous 1For a detailed introduction to multiple robustness and its importance in treatment effect estimation, we refer to (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018), Section 4.5. literature on IV estimation (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018), we impose the following standard IV assumptions on the data generating process. Assumption 1 (Standard IV assumptions (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018; Wooldridge, 2013)). We assume: (1) Exclusion: Y (a, z) = Y (a) for all a, z \u2208 {0, 1}, i.e., the instrument has no direct effect on the patient outcome; (2) Independence: Z \u22a5\u22a5 U | X; (3) Relevance: Z \u22a5\u0338\u22a5 A | X , (iv) The model includes all A\u2013Y confounder: Y (a) \u22a5\u22a5 (A,Z) | (X,U) for all a \u2208 {0, 1}. Assumption 1 is standard for IV methods and fulfilled in practical settings where IV methods are applied (Angrist, 1990; Angrist & Krueger, 1991; Imbens & Angrist, 1994). Note that Assumption 1 does not prohibit the existence of unobserved Z\u2013A confounders. On the contrary, it merely prohibits the existence of unobserved counfounders that affect all Z, A, and Y simultaneously, as it is standard in IV settings (Wooldridge, 2013). A practical and widespread example where Assumption 1 is satisfied are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with non-compliance (Imbens & Angrist, 1994). Here, the treatment assignment Z is randomized, but the actual relationship between treatment A and outcome Y may still be confounded. For instance, in the Oregon health insurance experiment (Finkelstein et al., 2012), people were given access to health insurance (Z) by a lottery with aim to study the effect of health insurance (A) on health outcome (Y ) (Finkelstein et al., 2012). Here, non-compliance information is observed because the lottery winners needed to sign up for health insurance. Objective: In this paper, we are interested in estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE) \u03c4(x) = E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X = x]. (1) If there is no unobserved confounding (U = \u2205), the ITE is identifiable from observational data (Shalit et al., 2017). However, in practice, it is often unlikely that all confounders are observable. To account for this, we leverage the instrument Z to identify the ITE. We state the following assumption for identifiability. Assumption 2 (Identifiability of the ITE (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018)). At least one of the following two statements holds true: (1) E[A | Z = 1, X, U ]\u2212 E[A | Z = 0, X, U ] = E[A | Z = 1, X]\u2212 E[A | Z = 0, X]; or (2) E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X,U ] = E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X]. Example: Assumption 1 holds is when the function f(a,X,U) = E[Y (a) | X,U ] is additive with respect to a and U , e.g., f(a,X,U) = g(a,X) + h(U) for measurable functions h and g. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the ITE is identifiable (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). It can be written as \u03c4(x) = \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) \u00b5A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) = \u03b4Y (x) \u03b4A(x) , (2) where \u00b5Yi (x) = E[Y | Z = i,X = x] and \u00b5Ai (x) = E[A | Z = i,X = x]. Even if Assumption 2 does not hold, the quantity on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) still allows for interpretation. If no unobserved Z\u2013A confounders exist, it can be interpreted as conditional version of the local average treatment effect (LATE) (Imbens & Angrist, 1994) under a monotonicity assumption. Furthermore, under a no-current-treatment-value-interaction assumption, it can be interpreted as conditional treatment effect on the treated (ETT) (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018).2 This has an important implication for our results: If Assumption 2 does not hold in practice, our estimates still provide conditional LATE or ETT estimates under the respective assumptions because they are based on Eq. (2). If Assumption 2 does hold, all three \u2013 i.e., ITE, conditional LATE, and ETT \u2013 coincide (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). 3 RELATED WORK: Machine learning methods for IV: Only recently, machine learning has been integrated into IV methods. These are: Singh et al. (2019) and Xu et al. (2021a) generalize 2SLS by learning complex feature maps using kernel methods and deep learning, respectively. Hartford et al. (2017) adopts a two-stage neural network architecture that performs the first stage via conditional density estimation. 2The conditional LATE measures the ITE for individuals which are part of the complier subpopulation, i.e., for whom A(Z = 1) > A(Z = 0). The conditional ETT measures the ITE for treated individuals. Bennett et al. (2019) leverages moment conditions for IV estimation. However, the aforementioned methods are not specifically designed for the binary IV setting but, rather, for multiple IVs or treatment scenarios. In particular, they impose stronger assumptions such as additive confounding in order to identify the ITE. Note that additive confounding is a special case of when our Assumption 2 holds. Moreover, they do not have robustness properties. In the binary IV setting, current methods proceed by estimating \u00b5Yi (x) and \u00b5 A i (x) separately, before plugging them in Eq. 2 (Imbens & Angrist, 1994; Angrist et al., 1996; Bargagli-Stoffi et al., 2021). As result, these suffer from plug-in bias and do not offer robustness properties. Doubly robust IV methods: Doubly robust estimators are commonly used in causal inference as they allow for consistent estimation under model misspecification and fast convergence rates (Kennedy, 2022). Recently, they also have been adopted for IV settings: Kennedy et al. (2019) propose a pseudo regression estimator for the local average treatment effect using continuous instruments, which has been extended to individual effects by Semenova & Chernozhukov (2021). Furthermore, Singh & Sun (2019) use a doubly robust approach to estimate average compiler parameters. Finally, Ogburn et al. (2015) and Syrgkanis et al. (2019) propose doubly robust ITE estimators in the IV setting which both rely on doubly robust parametrizations of the uncentered efficient influence function (Okui et al., 2012). However, none of these estimators has been shown to be multiply robust in the sense that they are consistent in the union of more than two model specifications (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). Multiply robust IV methods: Multiply robust estimators for IV settings have been proposed only for average treatment effects (ATEs) (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018) and optimal treatment regimes (Cui & Tchetgen, 2021) but not for ITEs. In particular, Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018) derive a multiply robust parametrization of the efficient influence function for the ATE. However, there exists no method that leverages this result for ITE estimation. We provide a detailed, technical comparison of existing methods and our framework in Appendix F. Research gap: To the best of our knowledge, there exists no method for ITE estimation under unobserved confounding that has been shown to be multiply robust. To fill this gap, we propose MRIV: a multiply robust machine learning framework tailored to the binary IV setting. For this, we build upon the approach by Kennedy (2022) to derive robust convergence rates, yet this approach has not been adapted to IV settings, which is our contribution. 4 MRIV FOR ESTIMATING ITES USING BINARY INSTRUMENTS: In the following, we present our MRIV framework for estimating ITEs under unobserved confounding (Sec. 4.1). We then derive an asymptotic convergence rate for MRIV (Sec. 4.2) and finally use our framework to develop a tailored deep neural network called MRIV-Net (Sec. 4.4). 4.1 FRAMEWORK: Motivation: A na\u0131\u0308ve approach to estimate the ITE is to leverage the identification result in Eq. (2). Assuming that we have estimated the nuisance components \u00b5\u0302Yi and \u00b5\u0302 A i for i \u2208 {0, 1}, we can simply plug them into Eq. (2) to obtain the so-called (plug-in) Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W(x) (Wald, 1940). However, in practice, the true ITE curve \u03c4(x) is often simpler (e.g., smoother, more sparse) than its complements \u00b5Yi (x) or \u00b5 A i (x) (Ku\u0308nzel et al., 2019). In this case, \u03c4\u0302W(x) is inefficient because it models all components separately, and, to address this, our proposed framework estimates \u03c4 directly using a pseudo outcome regression. Overview: We now propose MRIV. MRIV is a two-stage meta learner that takes any base method for ITE estimation as input. For instance, the base method could be the Wald estimator from Eq. (2), any other IV method such as 2SLS, or a deep neural network (as we propose in our MRIV-Net later in Sec. 4.4). In Stage 1, MRIV produces nuisance estimators \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), and \u03c0\u0302(x), where \u03c0\u0302(x) is an estimator of the propensity score \u03c0(x) = P(Z = 1 | X = x). In Stage 2, MRIV estimates \u03c4(x) directly using a pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR as a regression target. Given an arbitrary initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) and nuisance estimates \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), and \u03c0\u0302(x), we define the pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR = ( Z\u2212(1\u2212Z) \u03b4\u0302A(X) )( Y\u2212(\u00b5\u0302Y0 (X)+\u03c4\u0302init(X) (A\u2212\u00b5\u0302 A 0 (X))) Z \u03c0\u0302(X)+(1\u2212Z)(1\u2212\u03c0\u0302(X)) ) + \u03c4\u0302init(X). (3) Algorithm 1: MRIV Input : data (X,Z,A, Y ), initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) // Stage 1: Estimate nuisance components \u03c0\u0302(x)\u2190 E\u0302[Z | X = x], \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2190 E\u0302[Y | X = x, Z = 0], \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2190 E\u0302[A | X = x, Z = 0] \u03b4\u0302A(x)\u2190 E\u0302[A | X = x, Z = 1]\u2212 E\u0302[A | X = x, Z = 0] // Stage 2: Pseudo outcome regression Y\u0302MR \u2190( Z\u2212(1\u2212Z) \u03b4\u0302A(X) )( Y \u2212A \u03c4\u0302init(X)\u2212\u00b5\u0302 Y 0 (X)+\u00b5\u0302 A 0 (X) \u03c4\u0302init(X) Z \u03c0\u0302(X)+(1\u2212Z)(1\u2212\u03c0\u0302(X)) ) + \u03c4\u0302init(X) \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2190 E\u0302[Y\u0302MR | X = x] The pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR in Eq. (3) is a multiply robust parameterization of the (uncentered) efficient influence function for the average treatment effect EX [\u03c4(X)] (see the derivation in (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018)). Once we have obtained the pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR, we regress it on X to obtain the Stage 2 MRIV estimator \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) for \u03c4(x). The pseudocode for MRIV is given in Algorithm 1. MRIV can be interpreted as a way to remove plug-in bias from \u03c4\u0302init(x) (Curth et al., 2020). Using the fact that Y\u0302MR is a multiply robust parametrization of the efficient influence function, we derive a multiple robustness property of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x). Theorem 1 (multiple robustness property). Let \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302A0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), \u03c0\u0302(x), and \u03c4\u0302init(x) denote estimators of \u00b5Y0 (x), \u00b5 A 0 (x), \u03b4A(x), \u03c0(x), and \u03c4(x), respectively. Then, for all x \u2208 X , it holds that E[Y\u0302MR | X = x] = \u03c4(x),if least one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) \u00b5\u0302Y0 = \u00b5Y0 , \u00b5\u0302A0 = \u00b5A0 , and \u03c4\u0302init = \u03c4 ; or (2) \u03c0\u0302 = \u03c0 and \u03b4\u0302A = \u03b4A; or (3) \u03c0\u0302 = \u03c0 and \u03c4\u0302init = \u03c4 . Theorem 1 implies that \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) is consistent for \u03c4(x) if either condition (1), (2), or (3) holds. As a result, our MRIV framework is multiply robust in the sense that our estimator, \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x), is consistent in the union of three different model specifications. Importantly, this is different from doubly robust estimators which are only consistent in the union of two model specifications (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). Our MRIV is directly applicable to RCTs with non-compliance: Here, the treatment assignment is randomized and the propensity score \u03c0(x) is known. Our MRIV framework can be thus adopted by plugging in the known \u03c0(x) into the pseudo outcome in Eq. (3). Moreover, \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) is already consistent if either \u03c4\u0302init(x) or \u03b4\u0302A(x) are. 4.2 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS: In the following, we derive the asymptotic convergence rate of MRIV under smoothness assumptions. For this, we define s-smooth functions as functions contained in the Ho\u0308lder class H(s), associated with Stone\u2019s minimax rate (Stone, 1980) of n\u22122s/(2s+p), where p is the dimension of X . Assumption 3 (Smoothness). We assume that (1) the nuisance component \u00b5Y0 (\u00b7) is \u03b1-smooth, \u00b5A0 (\u00b7) is \u03b2-smooth, \u03c0(\u00b7) is \u03b3-smooth, and \u03b4A(\u00b7) is \u03b4-smooth; (2) all nuisance components are estimated with their respective minimax rate of n \u22122k 2k+p , where k \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4}; and (3) the oracle ITE \u03c4(\u00b7) is \u03b7-smooth and the initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init converges with rate r\u03c4 (n). Assumption 3 for smoothness provides us with a way to quantify the difficulty of the underlying nonparametric regression problems. Similar assumptions have been imposed for asymptotic analysis of previous ITE estimators in (Kennedy, 2022; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). They can be replaced with other assumptions such as assumptions on the level of sparsity of the ITE components. We also provide an asymptotic analysis under sparsity assumptions (see Appendix C). We additionally impose the following boundedness assumptions on the the underlying data generating process and estimators. Assumption 4 (Boundedness). We assume that there exist constants C, \u03c1, \u03c1\u0303, \u03f5,K > 0 such that for all x \u2208 X it holds that: (1) |\u00b5Yi (x)| \u2264 C; (2) |\u03b4A(x)| = |\u00b5A1 (x) \u2212 \u00b5A0 (x)| \u2265 \u03c1 and |\u03b4\u0302A(x)| \u2265 \u03c1\u0303; (3) \u03f5 \u2264 \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03f5; and (4) |\u03c4\u0302init(x)| \u2264 K. Assumptions 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4 are standard and in line with previous works on theoretical analyses of ITE estimators (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Kennedy, 2022). Assumption 4.2 ensures that both the oracle ITE and the estimator are bounded. Violations of Assumption 4.2 may occur when working with so-called \u201cweak\u201d instruments, which are IVs that are only weakly correlated with the treatment. Using IV methods with weak instruments should generally be avoided (Li et al., 2022). However, in many applications such as RCTs with non-compliance, weak instruments are unlikely to occur as patients\u2019 decisions to follow the treatment are generally correlated with the initial treatment assignments. We state now our main theoretical result: an upper bound on the oracle risk of the MRIV estimator. To derive our bound, we leverage the sample splitting approach from (Kennedy, 2022). The approach in (Kennedy, 2022) has been initially used to analyze the DR-learner for ITE estimation under unconfoundedness and allows for the derivation of robust convergence rates. It has later been adapted to several other meta learners (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021), yet not for IV methods. Theorem 2 (Oracle upper bound under smoothness). Let D\u2113 for \u2113 \u2208 {1, 2, 3} be independent samples of size n. Let \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x) be trained on D1, and let \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x) be trained on D2. We denote Y\u0302MR as the pseudo outcome from Eq. (3) and \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) = E\u0302n[Y\u0302MR | X = x] as the pseudo outcome regression on D3 for some generic estimator E\u0302n[\u00b7 | X = x] of E[\u00b7 | X = x]. We assume that the second-stage estimator E\u0302n yields the minimax rate n\u2212 2\u03b7 2\u03b7+p and satisfies the stability assumption from Kennedy (2022), Proposition 1 (see Appendix B). Then, the oracle risk is upper bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p+r\u03c4 (n) ( n \u22122\u03b3 2\u03b3+p + n \u22122\u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) +n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p )+n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ). Proof. See Appendix B. Recall that the first summand of the lower bound in Eq. (2) is the minimax rate for the oracle ITE \u03c4(x) which cannot be improved upon. Hence, for a fast convergence rate of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x), it is sufficient if either: (1) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b1, \u03b2 are large; (2) \u03b3 and \u03b4 are large; or (3) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b3 is large. This is in line with the multiply robustness property of MRIV (Theorem 1) and means that MRIV achieves a fast rate of convergence even if the initial estimator or several nuisance estimators converge slowly. Improvement over \u03c4\u0302init(x): From the bound in Eq. (2), it follows that \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) improves on the convergence rate of the initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) if its rate r\u03c4 (n) is lower bounded by r\u03c4 (n) \u2273 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p + n\u22122 ( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ) + n\u22122 ( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ). (4) Hence, our MRIV estimator is more likely to improve on the initial estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) if either (1) \u03b3 is large or (2) \u03b1 and \u03b2 are large. Note that the margin of improvement depends also on the size of \u03b3 and \u03b4, i.e., on the smoothness of \u03c0(x) and \u03b4A(x). In fact, this is widely fulfilled in practice. For example, the former is fulfilled for RCTs with non-compliance, where \u03c0(x) is often some known, fixed number p \u2208 (0, 1). Hence, for RCTs with non-compliance, MRIV should (at least asymptotically) improve the performance of most estimators. 4.3 MRIV VS. WALD ESTIMATOR: In the following, we compare \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) to the Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W(x). First, we derive corresponding upper bound under smoothness. Theorem 3 (Wald oracle upper bound). Assume that \u00b5Y1 (x), \u00b5Y0 (x) are \u03b1-smooth, \u00b5A1 (x), \u00b5A0 (x) are \u03b2-smooth, and are estimated with their respective minimax rate. Let \u03b4\u0302A(x) = \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) satisfy Assumption 4. Then, the oracle risk of the Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W (x) is bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n\u2212 2\u03b1 2\u03b1+p + n\u2212 2\u03b2 2\u03b2+p . (5) Proof. See Appendix B. We now consider the MRIV estimator \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) with \u03c4\u0302init = \u03c4\u0302W(x), i.e., initialized with the Wald estimator (under sample splitting). Plugging the Wald rate from Eq. (5) into the Eq. (2) yields E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p + n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ). For\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03b4, the rates of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) and \u03c4\u0302W(x) reduce to E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p+ n \u22124\u03b1 2\u03b1+p and E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p . Hence, \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) outperforms \u03c4\u0302W(x) asymptotically for \u03b7 > \u03b1, i.e., when the ITE \u03c4(x) is smoother than its components, which is usually the case in practice (Ku\u0308nzel et al., 2019). For \u03b7 = \u03b1, the rates of both estimators coincide. Hence, we should expect MRIV to improve on the Wald estimator in real-world settings with large sample size. 4.4 MRIV-NET: Based on our MRIV framwork, we develop a tailored deep neural network called MRIV-Net for ITE estimation using IVs. Our MRIV-Net produces both an initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) and nuisance estimators \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), and \u03c0\u0302(x). For MRIV-Net, we choose deep neural networks for the nuisance components due to their predictive power and their ability to learn complex shared representations for several nuisance components. Sharing representations between nuisance components has been exploited previously for ITE estimation, yet only under unconfoundedness (Shalit et al., 2017; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). Building shared representations is more efficient in finite sample regimes than estimating all nuisance components separately as they usually share some common structure. In MRIV-Net, not all nuisance components should share a representation. Recall that, in Theorem 2, we assumed that (1) \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302A0 (x); and (2) \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x) are trained on two independent samples in order to derive the upper bound on the oracle risk. Hence, we propose to build two separate representations \u03a61 and \u03a62, so that (i) \u03a61 is used to learn \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), and (ii) \u03a62 is used to learn \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x). This ensures that the nuisance estimators (1) share minimal information with nuisance estimators (2) even though they are estimated on the same data. Intuitively, this should lead to a faster decay of the oracle upper bound (cf. (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021)). The architecture of MRIV-Net is shown in Fig. 2. MRIV-Net takes the observed covariatesX as input to build the two representations \u03a61 and \u03a62. The first representation \u03a61 is used to output estimates \u00b5\u0302Y1 (x), \u00b5\u0302 Y 0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 1 (x), and \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x) of the ITE components. The second representation \u03a62 is used to output estimates \u00b5\u0303A1 (x), \u00b5\u0303 A 0 (x), and \u03c0\u0302(x). MRIV-Net is trained by minimizing an overall loss L(\u03b8) = \u2211n i=1 [( \u00b5\u0302Yzi(xi)\u2212 yi )2 +BCE ( \u00b5\u0302Azi(xi), ai ) +BCE ( \u00b5\u0303Azi(xi), ai ) +BCE (\u03c0\u0302(xi), zi) ] , (6) where \u03b8 denotes the neural network parameters and BCE is the binary cross entropy loss. After training MRIV-Net, we obtain the \u03c4\u0302init(x) = \u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212\u00b5\u0302 Y 0 (x) \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212\u00b5\u0302A0 (x) and obtain the nuisance estimators \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302A0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x) = \u00b5\u0303 A 1 (x) \u2212 \u00b5\u0303A0 (x) and \u03c0\u0302(x). Then, we perform, we perform the pseudo regression (Stage 2) of MRIV to obtain \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x). Implementation: We use PyTorch Lightning for our implementation and train MRIV-Net with the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015). Details on the network architecture and hyperparameter tuning are in Appendix H. We perform both the training of MRIV-Net and the pseudo outcome regression on the full training data. Needless to say, MRIV-Net can be easily adopted for sample splitting or cross-fitting procedures as in Chernozhukov et al. (2018), namely, by learning separate networks for each representation \u03a61 and \u03a62. In our experiments, we do not use sample splitting or cross-fitting, as this can affect the performance in finite sample regimes. Of note, our choice is consistent with previous work (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). In Appendix J we report results using cross-fitting. 5 COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 SIMULATED DATA: In causal inference literature, it is common practice to use simulated data for performance evaluations (Bica et al., 2020a; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Hartford et al., 2017). Simulated data offers the crucial benefit that it provides ground-truth information on the counterfactual outcomes and thus allows for direct benchmarking against the oracle ITE. Data generation: We generate simulated data by sampling the oracle ITE \u03c4(x) and the nuisance components \u00b5Yi (x), \u00b5 A i (x), and \u03c0(x) from Gaussian process priors. Using Gaussian processes has the following advantages: (1) It allows for a fair method comparison, as there is no need to explicitly specify the nuisance components, which could lead to unwanted inductive biases favoring a specific method; (2) the sampled nuisance components are non-linear and thus resemble real-world scenarios where machine learning methods would be applied; and, (3) by sampling from the prior induced by the Mate\u0301rn kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2008), we can control the smoothness of the nuisance components, which allows us to confirm our theoretical results from Sec. 4.2. For a detailed description of our data generating process, we refer to Appendix D. Baselines: We compare our MRIV-Net with state-of-the-art IV baselines. Details regarding baselines and nuisance parameter estimation are in Appendix F. Note that many of the baselines do not directly aim at ITE estimation but rather at counterfactual outcome prediction. We nevertheless use these methods as baselines and, for this, obtain the ITE by taking the difference between the predictions of the factual and counterfactual outcomes.

Lower = better (best in bold) Performance evaluation: For all experiments, we use a 80/20 split as training/test set. We calcalute the root mean squared errors (RMSE) between the ITE estimates and the oracle ITE on the test set. We report the mean RMSE and the standard deviation over five data sets generated from random seeds. Results: Table 2 shows the results for all baselines. Here, the DR-learner does not improve the performance of TARNet, which is reasonable as both the DRlearner and TARNet assume unconfoundedness and are thus biased in our setting. Our MRIV-Net outperforms all baselines. Our MRIV-Net also achieves a smaller standard deviation. For additional results, we refer to Appendix I. We further compare the performance of two different meta-learner frameworks \u2013 DRIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) and our MRIV\u2013 across different base methods. The results are in Table 3. The nuisance parameters are estimated using feed forward neural networks (DRIV) or TAR- Table 3: Base model with different meta-learners (i.e., none, DRIV, and our MRIV). n = 3000 n = 5000 n = 8000 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhBase methods Meta-learners None DRIV MRIV (ours) None DRIV MRIV (ours) None DRIV MRIV (ours) (1) STANDARD ITE TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) 0.76\u00b1 0.14 0.31 \u00b1 0.05 0.34\u00b1 0.13 0.70\u00b1 0.12 0.17 \u00b1 0.06 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 0.69\u00b1 0.17 0.21\u00b1 0.04 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 (2) GENERAL IV 2SLS (Wooldridge, 2013) 1.22\u00b1 0.23 0.40\u00b1 0.11 0.31 \u00b1 0.08 0.79\u00b1 0.37 0.17 \u00b1 0.09 0.19\u00b1 0.05 1.12\u00b1 0.29 0.21\u00b1 0.05 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 KIV (Singh et al., 2019) 1.54\u00b1 0.53 0.40\u00b1 0.10 0.39 \u00b1 0.11 1.18\u00b1 1.14 0.20\u00b1 0.08 0.17 \u00b1 0.06 3.80\u00b1 4.71 0.31\u00b1 0.18 0.28 \u00b1 0.19 DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a) 0.43\u00b1 0.11 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 0.27\u00b1 0.07 0.40\u00b1 0.21 0.18\u00b1 0.09 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 0.46\u00b1 0.54 0.21\u00b1 0.06 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017) 0.96\u00b1 0.30 0.27\u00b1 0.03 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 0.28\u00b1 0.09 0.18 \u00b1 0.08 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 0.23\u00b1 0.04 0.21\u00b1 0.03 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019) 0.95\u00b1 0.38 0.40\u00b1 0.15 0.36 \u00b1 0.13 0.37\u00b1 0.09 0.24\u00b1 0.12 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 0.42\u00b1 0.14 0.21\u00b1 0.03 0.17 \u00b1 0.03 DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) 1.92\u00b1 0.71 0.41\u00b1 0.12 0.37 \u00b1 0.11 0.92\u00b1 0.41 0.22\u00b1 0.05 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 1.14\u00b1 0.24 0.21\u00b1 0.06 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 (3) WALD ESTIMATOR (WALD, 1940) Linear 1.06\u00b1 0.63 0.42\u00b1 0.15 0.38 \u00b1 0.14 0.62\u00b1 0.22 0.19 \u00b1 0.09 0.25\u00b1 0.09 0.81\u00b1 0.34 0.19\u00b1 0.09 0.18 \u00b1 0.04 BART 0.95\u00b1 0.30 0.48\u00b1 0.14 0.46 \u00b1 0.12 0.63\u00b1 0.33 0.26\u00b1 0.13 0.20 \u00b1 0.07 0.88\u00b1 0.28 0.31\u00b1 0.08 0.29 \u00b1 0.04 MRIV-Net\\w network only (ours) 0.39\u00b1 0.13 0.35\u00b1 0.12 0.26 \u00b1 0.11 0.31\u00b1 0.04 0.19\u00b1 0.13 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 0.26\u00b1 0.06 0.18\u00b1 0.08 0.13 \u00b1 0.03 Reported: RMSE (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Lower = better (best improvement over none meta-learner in bold) Nets with either binary or continuous outputs (MRIV). Our MRIV improves over the variant without any meta-learner framework across all base methods (both in terms of RMSE and standard deviation). Furthermore, MRIV is clearly superior over DRIV. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our MRIV across different base methods (note: MRIV with an arbitrary base model is typically superior to DRIV with our custom network from above). MRIV-Net is overall best. We also performed additional experiments where we used semi-synthetic data and crossfitting approaches for both meta-learners (see Appendix I and J). Ablation study: Table 4 compares different variants of our MRIV-Net. These are: (1) MRIV but network only; (2) MRIV-Net with a single representation for all nuisance estimators; and (3) our MRIV-Net from above. We observe that MRIV-Net is best. This justifies our proposed network architecture for MRIV-Net. Hence, combing the result from above, our performance gain must be attributed to both our framework and the architecture of our deep neural network. Robustness checks for unobserved confounding and smoothness: Here, we demonstrate the importance of handling unobserved confounding (as we do in our MRIV framework). For this, Fig. 3 plots the results for our MRIV-Net vs. standard ITE without customization for confounding (i.e., TARNet with and without the DR-learner) over over different levels of unobserved confounding. The RMSE of both TARNet variants increase almost linearly with increasing confounding. In contrast, the RMSE of our MRIV-Net only marginally. Even for low confounding regimes, our MRIV-Net performs competitively. Fig. 4 varies the smoothness level. This is given by \u03b1 of \u00b5Yi (\u00b7) (controlled by the Mate\u0301rn kernel prior). Here, the performance decreases for the baselines, i.e., DeepIV and our network without MRIV framework. In contrast, the peformance of our MRIV-Net remains robust and outperforms the baselines. This confirms our theoretical results from above. It thus indicates that our MRIV framework works best when the oracle ITE \u03c4(x) is smoother than the nuisance parameters \u00b5Yi (x). 5.2 CASE STUDY WITH REAL-WORLD DATA: Setting: We demonstrate effectiveness of our framework using a case study with real-world, medical data. Here, we use medical data from the so-called Oregon health insurance experiment (OHIE) (Finkelstein et al., 2012). It provides data for an RCT with non-compliance: In 2008, \u223c30,000 low-income, uninsured adults in Oregon were offered participation in a health insurance program by a lottery. Individuals whose names were drawn could decide to sign up for health insurance. After a period of 12 months, in-person interviews took place to evaluate the health condition of the respective participant. 20 40 60 Age 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 Es tim at ed IT E gender = male 20 40 60 Age gender = female Method TARNet MRIV-Net\\w netowrk only MRIV-Net (ours) DMLIV + DRIV Figure 5: Results on real-world medical data. In our analysis, the lottery assignment is the instrument Z, the decision to sign up for health insurance is treatment A, and an overall health score is the outcome Y . We also include five covariates X , including age and gender. For details, we refer to Appendix E. We first estimate the ITE function and then report the treatment effect heterogeneity w.r.t. age and gender, while fixing the other covariates. The results for MRIV-Net, our neural network architecture without the MRIV framework, and TARNet are in Fig. 5. Results: Our MRIV-Net estimates larger causal effects for an older age. In contrast, TARNet does not estimate positive ITEs even for an older age. Even though we cannot evaluate the estimation quality on real-world data, our estimates seem reasonable in light of the medical literature: the benefit of health insurance should increase with older age. This showcases that TARNet may suffer from bias induced by unobserved confounders. We also report the results for DRIV with DMLIV as base method, and observe that in contrast to MRIV-Net, the corresponding ITE does not vary much between ages. Interestingly, both our MRIV-Net estimate a somewhat smaller ITE for middle ages (around 30\u201350 yrs). One explanation might be that individual in this age group are more likely to have stable jobs and, thus, are also more likely to be able to afford medical care, decreasing the direct effect of health insurance on individuals health. In sum, the findings from our case study are of direct relevance for decision-makers in public health (Imbens & Angrist, 1994), and highlight the practical value of our framework. Reproducibility: Details for reproducing the experiment results can be found in the supplementary materials (Readme.md). A EXTENDED RELATED WORK: ITE methods without unconfoundedness: Various machine learning methods for estimating ITEs without unobserved confounding have been proposed in recent literature (Alaa & van der Schaar, 2017; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Ku\u0308nzel et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2018; Shalit et al., 2017; Wager & Athey, 2018; Yoon et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). To remove plug-in bias, the DR-learner performs a second stage regression on the uncentered influence function of the average treatment effect (Kennedy, 2022). However, under unobserved confounding, all of these methods are biased (see Appendix F). As a result, this hampers their performance in our setting. Non-IV methods for unobserved confounding: There is a rich literature for causal effect estimation under unobserved confounding, which does not assume the existence of instrumental variables. Methods include deconfounding methods (Wang & Blei, 2019; Bica et al., 2020b), proxy learning methods (Cui et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021b), and causal sensitivity analysis (Kallus et al., 2019; Jesson et al., 2021).. Classical IV methods: IV methods address the problem of unobserved confounding by exploiting the variance in treatment and outcome induced by the instruments. Traditionally, two-stage least squares (2SLS) has been used for estimating causal effects (Wright, 1928; Angrist & Krueger, 1991). 2SLS was originally developed in economics, and follows a two-stage procedure: it performs a first stage regression of treatment A on the instrument Z, and then uses the fitted values for a second stage regression to predict the outcome Y . Several nonparametric methods have been developed in econometric to generalize 2SLS in order to account for non-linearities within the data (Newey & Powell, 2003; Wang et al., 2021), yet these are limited to low-dimensional settings. B PROOFS: We start by deriving an auxiliary Lemma. That is, we derive an explicit expression for the Stage 2 oracle pseudo outcome regression E[Y\u0302MR | X = x] of MRIV. Lemma 1.

We refer to Kennedy (2022) (Proposition 1) for a detailed discussion on this assumption. Assumption 5 (From Proposition 1 of Kennedy (2022)). Let YMR be the corresponding oracle to the estimated pseudo-outcome Y\u0302MR. We assume that the pseudo-regression estimator E\u0302n satisfies E\u0302n[Y\u0302MR | X = x]\u2212 E\u0302n[YMR | X = x]\u2212 E\u0302n[Y\u0302MR \u2212 YMR | X = x]\u221a E [( E\u0302n[YMR | X = x]\u2212 E[YMR | X = x] )2] p\u2192 0 (18) and E [ E\u0302n[r\u0302(X) | X = x]2 ] \u224d E [ r\u0302(x)2 ] , (19) where r(x) = E[Y\u0302MR | X = x]\u2212 \u03c4(x) Proof of Theorem 2. Let YMR be the corresponding oracle to Y\u0302MR and define \u03c4\u0303MRIV(x) = E\u0302n[YMR | X = x]. Using Assumption 5, we can apply Proposition 1 of Kennedy (2022) and obtain E [ (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 R(x) + E [ r\u0302(x)2 ] , (20) where R(x) = E [ (\u03c4\u0303MR(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] is the oracle risk of the second stage regression. We can apply Lemma 1 to obtain r\u0302(x) = \u03c0(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) ( \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ) + (1\u2212 \u03c0(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) ( \u00b5A0 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) ) + \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ( \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03c0(x) 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x) ) + \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x) (21) = ( \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ) \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ( \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03c0(x) 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x) ) + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x)) + ( (\u00b5A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x)) \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ) \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + (\u00b5\u0302D0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5D0 (x)) \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ( \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03c0(x) 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x) ) (22) = \u03b4Y (x)\u03c0(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + ( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) ) (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x)) \u2212 \u03b4A(x)\u03c0(x) \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) ) \u03c4\u0302init(x) (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) (23) = (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) ) + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) ) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ] + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x)) + \u03c0(x)\u03b4A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x)\u03b4\u0302A(x) (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x)) (24) = (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) ) + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) ) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ] + (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x)) ( \u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x) ) \u03c0(x) + (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x)) (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x). (25) Applying the inequality (a+ b)2 \u2264 2(a2+ b2) together with Assumption 4 and the fact that \u03c0(x) \u2264 1 yields r\u0302(x)2 \u2264 4 \u03f54\u03c12 (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x))2 [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) )2 + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) )2 K2 ] + 4 (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x))2 ( \u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x) )2 + 4 (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x))2 (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x))2 . (26) By setting K\u0303 = max{K, 1}, we obtain r\u0302(x)2 \u2264 4K\u0303 2 \u03f54\u03c12 ( (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x))2 [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) )2 + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) )2 + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] + (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x))2 ( \u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x) )2) . (27) Applying expectations on both sides yields E [ (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] (28) \u2272R(x) + E [ (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ]( E [( \u03b4\u0302A(x)\u2212 \u03b4A(x) )2] + E [ (\u03c0\u0302(x)\u2212 \u03c0(x))2 ]) + E [ (\u03c0\u0302(x)\u2212 \u03c0(x))2 ] ( E [( \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) )2] + E [( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) )2]) , (29) because (\u03c0\u0302(x), \u03b4\u0302A(x)) \u22a5\u22a5 (\u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302A0 (x), \u03c4\u0302init(x)) due to sample splitting. The claim follows now by applying Assumption 3. B.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 3 (CONVERGENCE RATE OF THE WALD ESTIMATOR) Proof. We define C\u0303 = max{C, 1} and obtain the upper bound (\u03c4\u0302W (x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 (30) = ( (\u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y1 (x)) \u03b4A(x) + (\u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)) \u03b4A(x) + (\u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x)) \u03b4Y (x) \u03b4A(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) )2 (31) \u2264 4C\u0303 2 \u03c12\u03c1\u03032 [ (\u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y1 (x))2 + (\u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x))2 + (\u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x))2 ] (32) \u2264 8C\u0303 2 \u03c12\u03c1\u03032 [ (\u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y1 (x))2 + (\u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x))2 + (\u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x))2 +(\u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x))2 ] , (33) where we used the inequality (a+ b)2 \u2264 2(a2 + b2) several times. Taking expectations and applying the smoothness assumptions yields the result. C THEORETICAL ANALYSIS UNDER SPARSITY ASSUMPTIONS: In Sec. 4.2, we analyzed MRIV theoretically by imposing smoothness assumptions on the underlying data generating process. In particular, we derived a multiple robust convergence rate and showed that MRIV outperforms the Wald estimator if the oracle ITE is smoother than its components. In this section, we derive similar results by relying on a different set of assumptions. Instead of using smoothness, we make assumptions on the level of sparsity of the ITE components. This assumption is often imposed in high-dimensional settings (n < p) and is in line with previous literature on analyzing ITE estimators (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Kennedy, 2022). In the following, we say a function f(x) is k-sparse, if it is linear in x \u2208 Rp and it only depends on k < min{n, p} predictors. (Yang & Tokdar, 2015) showed, that in this case the minimax rate of f(x) is given by k log(p)n . The linearity assumption can be relaxed to an additive structural assumption, which we omit here for simplicity. In the following, we replace the smoothness conditions in Assumption 3 with sparsity conditions. Assumption 6 (Sparsity). We assume that (1) the nuisance components \u00b5Yi (\u00b7) are \u03b1-sparse, \u00b5Ai (\u00b7) and \u03b4A(\u00b7) are \u03b2-sparse, and \u03c0(\u00b7) is \u03b4-sparse; (2) all nuisance components are estimated with their respective minimax rate of k log(p)n , where k \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4}; and (3) the oracle ITE \u03c4(\u00b7) is \u03b3-sparse and the initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init converges with rate r\u03c4 (n). We restate now our result from Theorem 3 for MRIV using the sparsity assumption. Theorem 4 (MRIV upper bound under sparsity). We consider the same setting as in Theorem 2 under the sparsity assumption 6. If the second-stage estimator E\u0302n yields the minimax rate \u03b3 log(p)n and satisfies Assumption 5, the oracle risk is upper bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 \u03b3 log(p) n + r\u03c4 (n) (\u03b2 + \u03b4) log(p) n + (\u03b1+ \u03b2)\u03b4 log2(p) n2 . Proof. Follows immediately from the proof of Theorem 2, i.e., from Eq.(28) by applying Ass- 6. Again, we obtain a multiple robust convergence rate for MRIV in the sense that MRIV achieves a fast rate even if the initial estimator or several nuisance estimators converge slowly. More precisely, for a fast convergence rate of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x), it is sufficient if either: (1) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b4 is small; (2) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small; or (3) all \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4 are small. We derive now the corresponding rate for the Wald estimator. Theorem 5 (Wald oracle upper bound). Given estimators \u00b5\u0302Yi (x) and \u00b5\u0302Ai (x). Let \u03b4\u0302A(x) = \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) satisfy Assumption 4. Then, under Assumption 6 the oracle risk of the Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W (x) is bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 (\u03b1+ \u03b2) log(p) n (34) Proof. Follows immediately from the proof of Theorem 3, i.e., from Eq.(30) by applying Ass- 6. If \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b4, we obtain the rates E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 \u03b3 log(p) n + \u03b12 log2(p) n2 and E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 \u03b1 log(p) n , (35) which means that \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) outperforms \u03c4\u0302W(x) for \u03b3 < \u03b1, i.e., if the oracle ITE is more sparse than its components. D SIMULATED DATA: In the following, we describe how we simulate synthetic data for the experiments in Sec. 5.1 from the main paper. As mentioned therein, we simulate the ITE components from Gaussian processes using the prior induced by the Matern kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2008) K\u2113,\u03bd(xi, xj) = 1 \u0393(\u03bd)2\u03bd\u22121 (\u221a 2\u03bd \u2113 \u2225xi \u2212 xj\u22252 )\u03bd K\u03bd (\u221a 2\u03bd \u2113 \u2225xi \u2212 xj\u22252 ) , (36) where \u0393(\u00b7) is the Gamma function and K\u03bd(\u00b7) is the modified Bessel function of second kind. Here, \u2113 is the length scale of the kernel and \u03bd controls the smoothness of the sampled functions. We set \u2113 = 1 and sample functions \u03b4Y \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b3), \u00b5Y0 \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b1), f1 \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b2), f0 \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b2) and g \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b2). Then, we define \u00b5Y1 = \u03b4Y + \u00b5Y0 , \u00b5A1 = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3 \u25e6 f1 + 0.7, \u00b5A0 = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3 \u25e6 f0, \u03b4A = \u00b5A1 \u2212 \u00b5A0 , \u00b5Y0 = c0\u03b4A, and \u03c0 = \u03c3 \u25e6 g. Finally, we set the oracle ITE to \u03c4 = \u00b5Y1 \u2212 \u00b5Y0 \u00b5A1 \u2212 \u00b5A0 = \u03b4Y \u03b4A . (37) Note that we can create a setup where the ITE \u03c4 is smoother than its components by using a small \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio. An example is shown in Fig. 6. In the following, we describe how we generate data the (X,Z,A, Y ) using the ITE components \u00b5Yi (x), \u00b5 A i (x), and \u03c0(x). We begin by sampling n observed confounder X \u223c N (0, 1), unobserved confounders U \u223c N ( 0, 0.22 ) , and instruments Z \u223c Bernoulli(\u03c0(X)). Then, we obtain treatments via A = Z 1{U + \u03f5A > \u03b11(X)}+ (1\u2212 Z)1{U + \u03f5A > \u03b10(X)} (38) with indicator function 1, noise \u03f5A \u223c N ( 0, 0.12 ) , and \u03b1i(X) = \u03a6\u22121 ( 1\u2212 \u00b5Ai (X) )\u221a 0.12 + 0.22, where \u03a6\u22121 denotes the quantile function of the standard normal distribution. Finally, we generate the outcomes via Y = A ( (\u00b5A1 (X)\u2212 1)\u00b5Y0 (X)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (X)\u00b5Y1 (X) + \u00b5Y1 (X) \u03b4A(X) ) (39) + (1\u2212A) ( \u00b5A1 (X)\u00b5 Y 0 (X)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (X)\u00b5Y1 (X) \u03b4A(X) ) + \u03b1UU + \u03f5Y , (40) where \u03f5Y \u223c N ( 0, 0.32 ) is noise and \u03b1U > 0 is a parameter indicating the level of unobserved confounding. This choice of A and Y in Eq. (38) and Eq. (39), respectively, implies that \u03c4(x) is indeed the ITE, i. e., it holds that \u03c4(x) = E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X = x]. Lemma 2. Let (X,Z,A, Y ) be sampled from the the previously described procedure. Then, it holds that \u00b5Ai (x) = E[A | Z = i,X = x] and \u00b5Yi (x) = E[Y | Z = i,X = x]. (41) Proof. The first claim follows from E[A | Z = i,X = x] = P (U + \u03f5A > \u03b1i(x)) = 1\u2212 \u03a6(\u03a6\u22121(1\u2212 \u00b5Ai (x))) = \u00b5Ai (x), (42) because U + \u03f5A \u223c N (0, \u221a 0.12 + 0.22). The second claim follows from E[Y | Z = i,X = x] = \u00b5Ai (x) ( (\u00b5A1 (x)\u2212 1)\u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x)\u00b5Y1 (x) + \u00b5Y1 (x) \u03b4A(x) ) (43) + (1\u2212 \u00b5Ai (x)) ( \u00b5A1 (x)\u00b5 Y 0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x)\u00b5Y1 (x) \u03b4A(x) ) (44) = \u00b5Yi (x)\u03b4A(x) \u03b4A(x) = \u00b5Yi (x). (45) E OREGON HEALTH INSURANCE EXPERIMENT: The so-called Oregon health insurance experiment3 (OHIE) (Finkelstein et al., 2012) was an important RCT with non-compliance. It was intentionally conducted as large-scale effort among public health to assess the effect of health insurance on several outcomes such as health or economic status. In 2008, a lottery draw offered low-income, uninsured adults in Oregon participation in a Medicaid program, providing health insurance. Individuals whose names were drawn could decide to sign up for the program. In our analysis, the lottery assignment is the instrument Z, the decision to sign up for the Medicaid program is the treatment A, and an overall health score is the outcome Y . The outcome was obtained after a period of 12 months during in-person interviews. We use the following covariates X: age, gender, language, the number of emergency visits before the experiment, and the number of people the individual signed up with. The latter is used to control for peer effects, and it is important to include this variable in our analysis as it is the only variable influencing the propensity score (see below). We extract \u223c 10,000 observations from the OHIE data and plot the histograms of all variables in Fig. 7. We can clearly observe the presence of non-compliance within the data, because the ratio of treated / untreated individuals is much lower than the corresponding ratio for the treatment assignment. The data collection in the OHIE was done follows: After excluding individuals below the age of 19, above the age of 64, and individuals with residence outside of Oregon, 74,922 individuals were considered for the lottery. Among those, 29,834 were selected randomly and were offered participation in the program. However, the probability of selection depended on the number of household members on the waiting list: for instance, an individual who signed up with another person was twice as likely to be selected. From the 74,922 individuals, 57,528 signed up alone, 17,236 signed up with another person, and 158 signed up with two more people on the waiting list. Thus, the probability of being selected conditional on the number of household members on the waiting list follows the multivariate version of Wallenius\u2019 noncentral hypergeometric distribution (Chesson, 1976). Propensity score: We computed the propensity score as follows. To account for the Wallenius\u2019 noncentral hypergeometric distribution, we use the R package BiasedUrn to calculate the propensity score \u03c0(x) = P(Z = 1 | X = x). We obtained \u03c0(x) =  0.345, if individual x signed up alone, 0.571, if individual x signed up with one more person, 0.719, if individual x signed up with two more people. (46) 3Data available here: https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/oregon-health-insuranceexperiment During the training of both MRIV and DRIV, we use the calculated values from Eq. (46) for the propensity score. F DETAILS FOR BASELINE METHODS: In this section, we give a brief overview on the baselines which we used in our experiments. We implemented: (1) ITE methods for unconfoundedness: TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) and TARNet combined with the DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022); (2) general IV methods, i.e., IV methods developed for IV settings with multiple or continuous instruments and treatments: 2SLS (Wright, 1928), kernel IV (KIV) (Singh et al., 2019), DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a), DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017), DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019), DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019), and DMLIV combined with DRIV (as described in (Syrgkanis et al., 2019)); (3) the (plug-in) Wald estimator using linear models and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) (Chipman et al., 2010). Of note, the DR-learner assumes unconfoundedness, which is why we only combine it TARNet in our experiments. In the following, we provide details regarding methods and implementation. F.1 ITE METHODS FOR UNCONFOUNDEDNESS Many ITE methods assume unconfoundedness, i.e., that all confounders are observed in the data. Formally, the unconfoundedness assumption can be expressed in the potential outcomes framework as Y (1), Y (0) \u22a5\u22a5 A | X. (47) Under unconfoundedness, the ITE is identified as \u03c4(x) = \u00b51(x)\u2212 \u00b50(x) with \u00b5i(x) = E[Y | A = i,X = x]. (48) Methods that assume unconfoundedness proceed by estimating \u00b5i(x) = E[Y | A = i,X = x] from Eq. (48). However, if unobserved confounders U exist, it follows that \u03c4(x) = E[Y | A = 1, X = x, U ]\u2212 E[Y | A = 0, X = x, U ] \u0338= \u00b51(x)\u2212 \u00b50(x), (49) which means that estimators that assume unconfoundedness are generally biased. Nevertheless, we include two baselines that assume unconfoundedness into our experiments: TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) and the DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022). TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017): TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) is a neural network that estimates the ITE components \u00b5i(x) from Eq. 48 by learning a shared representation \u03a6(x) and two potential outcome heads hi(\u03a6(x)). We train TARNet by minimizing the loss L(\u03b8) = n\u2211 i=1 L (hai(\u03a6(xi, \u03b8\u03a6), \u03b8hi), yi) , (50) where \u03b8 = (\u03b8h1 , \u03b8h0 , \u03b8\u03a6) denotes the model parameters and L denotes squared loss if Y is continuous or binary cross entropy loss if Y is binary. Note regarding balanced representations: In (Shalit et al., 2017), the authors propose to add an additional regularization term inspired from domain adaptation literature, which forces TARNet to learn a balanced representation \u03a6(x), i.e., that minimizes the distance the treatment and control group in the feature space. They showed that this approach leads to minimization of a generalization bound on the ITE estimation error if the representation is invertible. In our experiments, we refrained from learning balanced representations because minimizing the regularized loss from (Shalit et al., 2017) does not necessarily result in an invertible representation and thus may even harm the estimation performance. For a detailed discussion, we refer to (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). Furthermore, by leaving out the regularization, we ensure comparability between the different baselines. If balanced representations are desired, the balanced representation approach could also be extended to MRIV-Net, as we also build MRIV-Net on learning shared representations. DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022): The DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022) is a meta learner that takes arbitrary estimators of the ITE componenets \u00b5i and the propensity score \u03c0(x) = P(A = 1 | X = x) as input and performs a pseudo outcome regression by using the pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR = ( A \u03c0\u0302(X) \u2212 1\u2212A 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(X) ) Y + ( 1\u2212 A \u03c0\u0302(X) ) \u00b5\u03021(X)\u2212 ( 1\u2212 1\u2212A 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(X) ) \u00b5\u03020(X). (51) In our experiments, we use TARNet as base method to provide initial estimators \u00b5\u0302i(X). We further learn propensity score estimates \u03c0\u0302(X) by adding a seperate representation to TARNet as done in (Shalit et al., 2017). F.2 GENERAL IV METHODS 2SLS (Wright, 1928): 2SLS (Wright, 1928) is a linear two-stage approach. First, the treatments A are regressed on the instruments Z and fitted values A\u0302 are obtained. In the second stage, the outcome Y is regressed on A\u0302. We implement 2SLS using the scikit-learn package. KIV (Singh et al., 2019): Kernel IV (Singh et al., 2019) generalizes 2SLS to nonlinear settings. KIV assumes that the data is generated by Y = f(A) + U, (52) where U is an additive unobserved confounder and f is some unknown (potentially nonlinear) structural function. KIV then models the structural function via f(a) = \u00b5t\u03c8(a) and E[\u03c8(A) | Z = z] = V \u03d5(z), (53) where \u03c8 and\u03d5 are feature maps. Here, kernel ridge regressions instead of linear regressions are used in both stages to estimate \u00b5 and V . Following (Singh et al., 2019) we use the exponential kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2008) and set the length scale to the median inter-point distance. KIV does not provide a direct way to incorporate the observed confounders X . Hence, we augment both the instrument and the treatment with X , which is consistent with previous work (Bennett et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021a). We also use two different samples for each stage as recommended in (Singh et al., 2019). DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a): DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a) is a similar approach KIV in generalizing 2SLS to nonlinear setting by assuming Eq. (52) and Eq. (53). However, instead of using kernel methods, DFIV models the features maps \u03c8\u03b8A and \u03d5\u03b8Z as neural networks with parameters \u03b8A and \u03b8Z , respectively. DFIV is trained by iteratively updating the parameters \u03b8A and \u03b8Z . The authors also provide a training algorithm that incorporates observed confounders X , which we implemented for our experiments. During training, we used two different datasets for each of the two stages as described in in the paper. DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017): DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017) also assumes additive unobserved confounding as in Eq. (52), but leverages the identification result (Newey & Powell, 2003) E[Y | X = x, Z = z] = \u222b h(a, x) dF (a | x, z), (54) where h(a, x) = f(a, x) + E[U | X = x] is the target counterfactual prediction function. DeepIV estimates F (a | x, z), i.e., the conditional distribution function of the treatment A given observed covariates X and instruments Z, by using neural networks. Because we consider only binary treatments, we simply implement a (tunable) feed-forward neural network with sigmoid activation function. Then, DeepIV proceeds by learning a second stage neural network to solve the inverse problem defined by Eq. (54). DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019): DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019) adopts neural networks for IV estimation inspired by the (optimally weighted) Generalized Method of Moments. The DeepGMM estimator is defined as the solution of the following minimax game: \u03b8\u0302 \u2208 argmin \u03b8\u2208\u0398 sup \u03c4\u2208T 1 n n\u2211 i=1 f(zi, \u03c4)(yi \u2212 g(ai, \u03b8))\u2212 1 4n n\u2211 i=1 f2(zi, \u03c4)(yi \u2212 g(ai, \u03b8\u0303))2, (55) where f(zi, \u00b7) and g(ai, \u00b7) are parameterized by neural networks. As recommended in (Bennett et al., 2019), we solve this optimization via adversarial training with the Optimistic Adam optimizer (Daskalakis et al., 2018), where we set the parameter \u03b8\u0303 to the previous value of \u03b8. DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019): DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) assumes that the data is generated via Y = \u03c4(X)A+ f(X) + U, (56) where \u03c4 is the ITE f some function of the observed covariates. First, DMLIV estimates the functions q(X) = E[Y | X], h(Z,X) = E[A | Z,X], and p(X) = E[A | X]. Then, the ITE is learned by minimizing the loss L(\u03b8) = \u2211 i=1 (yi \u2212 q\u0302(xi)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302(xi, \u03b8)(h\u0302(zi, xi)\u2212 p\u0302(xi))2, (57) where \u03c4\u0302(X, \u00b7) is some model for \u03c4(X). In our experiments, we use (tunable) feed-forward neural networks for all estimators. DRIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019): DRIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) is a meta learner, originally proposed in combination with DMLIV. It requires initial estimators for q(X), p(X), \u03c0(X) = E[Z | X = x], and f(X) = E[A \u00b7Z | X = x] as well as an initial ITE estimatior \u03c4\u0302init(X) (e.g., from DMLIV). The ITE is then estimated by a pseudo regression on the following doubly robust pseudo outcome: Y\u0302DR = \u03c4\u0302init(X) + (Y \u2212 q\u0302(X)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(X)(A\u2212 p\u0302(X))Z \u2212 \u03c0\u0302(X)) f\u0302(X)\u2212 p\u0302(X)r\u0302(X) . (58) We implement all regressions using (tunable) feed-forward neural networks. Comparison between DRIV vs. MRIV: There are two key differences between our paper and (Syrgkanis et al., 2019): (i) In contrast to DRIV, we showed that our MRIV is multiply robust. (ii) We derive a multiple robust convergence rate, while the rate in (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) is not robust with respect to the nuisance rates. Ad (i): Both MRIV and DRIV perform a pseudo-outcome regression on the efficient influence function (EIF) of the ATE. The key difference: DRIV uses the doubly robust parametrization of the EIF from (Okui et al., 2012), whereas we use the multiply robust parametrization of the EIF from (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018)4. Hence, our MRIV frameworks extends DRIV in a non-trivial way to achieve multiple robustness. Thus, our estimator is consistent in the union of three different model specifications.5 Ad (ii): Here, we compare the convergence rates from DRIV and our MRIV and, thereby, show the strengths of our MRIV. To this end, let us assume that the pseudo regression function is \u03b3-smooth and that we use the same second-stage estimator E\u0302n with minimax rate n\u2212 2\u03b3 2\u03b3+p for both DRIV and MRIV. If the nuisance parameters q(X), p(X), f(X), and \u03c0(X) are \u03b1-smooth and further are estimated with minimax rate n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p , Corollary 4 from (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) states that DRIV converges with rate E [ (\u03c4\u0302DRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b3 2\u03b3+p + n \u22124\u03b1 2\u03b1+p . In contrast, MRIV assumes estimation of the nuisance parameters \u00b5Y0 (x) with rate n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p , \u00b5A0 (x) and \u03b4A(x) with rate n \u22122\u03b2 2\u03b2+p , and \u03c0(x) with rate n \u22122\u03b4 2\u03b4+p . If the initial estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) converges with rate r\u03c4 (n), our Theorem 2 yields the rate E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b3 2\u03b3+p + r\u03c4 (n) ( n \u22122\u03b2 2\u03b2+p + n \u22122\u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ). If all nuisance parameters converge with the same minimax rate of n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p , the rates of DRIV and our MRIV coincide. However, different to DRIV, our rate is additionally multiple robust in spirit of Theorem 1. This presents a crucial strength of our MRIV over DRIV: For example, if \u03b4 is small (slow convergence of \u03c0\u0302(x)), our MRIV still with fast rate as long as \u03b1 and \u03b2 are large (i.e., if the other nuisance parameters are sufficiently smooth). F.3 WALD ESTIMATOR Finally, we consider the Wald estimator (Wald, 1940) for the binary IV setting. More precisely, we estimate the ITE components \u00b5Yi (x) and \u00b5 A i (x) seperately and plug them into \u03c4(x) = \u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) . (59) We consider two versions of the Wald estimator: 4For a detailed discussion on multiple robustness and the importance of the EIF parametrization, we refer to (Wang & Blei, 2019), Section 4.5. 5On a related note, a similar, important contribution of developing multiply robust method was recently made for the average treatment effect. Here, the estimator of (Okui et al., 2012) was extended by the estimator of (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018) to allow for multi robustness. Yet, this different from our work in that it focuses on the average treatment effect, while we study the individual treatment effect in our paper. Linear: We use linear regressions to estimate the \u00b5Yi (x) and logistic regressions to estimate the \u00b5Ai (x). BART: We use Bayesian additive regression trees (Chipman et al., 2010) trees to estimate the \u00b5Yi (x) and random forest classifier to estimate the \u00b5Ai (x). G VISUALIZATION OF PREDICTED ITES We plot the predicted ITEs for the different baselines and MRIV-Net in Fig. 8 (for n = 3000). As expected, the linear methods (2SLS and linear Wald) are not flexible enough to provide accurate ITE estimates. We also observe that the curve of MRIV-Net without MRIV is quite wiggly, i.e., the estimator has a relatively large variance. This variance is reduced when the full MRIV-Net is applied. As a result, curve is much smoother. This is reasonable because MRIV does not estimate the ITE components individually, but estimates the ITE directly via the Stage 2 pseudo outcome regression. Overall, this confirms the superiority of our proposed framework. H IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND HYPERPARAMETER TUNING Implementation details for deep learning models: To make the performance of the deep learning models comparable, we implemented all feed-forward neural networks (including MRIV-Net) as follows: We use two hidden layers with RELU activation functions. We also incorporated a dropout layer for each hidden layer. We trained all models with the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) using 100 epochs. Exceptions are only DFIV and DeepGMM, where we used 200 epochs for training, accounting for slower convergence of the respective (adversarial) training algorithms. For DeepGMM, we further used Optimistic Adam (Daskalakis et al., 2018) as in the original paper. Training times: We report the approximate times needed to train the deep learning models on our simulated data with n = 5000 in Table 5. For training, we used an AMD Ryzen Pro 7 CPU. Compared to DMLIV and DRIV, the training of MRIV-Net is faster because only a single neural network is trained. Hyperparameter tuning: We performed hyperparameter tuning for all deep learning models (including MRIV-Net), KIV, and the BART Wald estimator on all datasets. For all methods except KIV and DFIV, we split the data into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). We then performed 40 random grid search iterations and chose the set of parameters that minimized the respective training loss on the validation set. In particular, the tuning procedure was the same for all baselines, which ensures that the performance gain of MRIV-Net is due to the method itself and not due to larger flexibility. Exceptions are only KIV and DFIV, for which we implemented the customized hyperparameter tuning algorithms proposed in (Singh et al., 2019) and (Xu et al., 2021a) to ensure consistency with prior literature. For the meta learners (DR-learner, DRIV, and MRIV), we first performed hyperparameter tuning for the base methods and nuisance models, before tuning the pseudo outcome regression neural network by using the input from the tuned models. The tuning ranges for the hyperparameter are shown in Table 6. These include both the hyperparameter rangers shared across all neural networks and the model-specific hyperparameters. For reproducibility purposes, we publish the selected hyperparameters in our GitHub project as .yaml files.6 Hyperparameter robustness checks: We also investigate the robustness of MRIV-Net with respect to hyperparameter choice. To to this, we fix the optimal hyperparameter constellation for our simulated data for n = 3000 and perturb the hidden layer sizes, learning rate, dropout probability, and batch size. The results are shown in Fig. 9. We observe that the RMSE only changes marginally when perturbing 6Codes are in the supplementary materials. the different hyperparameters, indicating that our method is to a certain degree robust against hyperparameter misspecification. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance improvement of MRIV-Net over the baselines observed in our experiments is not due to hyperparameter tuning, but to our method itself. I RESULTS FOR SEMI-SYNTHETIC DATA: In the main paper, we evaluated MRIV-Net both on synthetic and real-world data. Here, we provide additional results by constructing a semi-synthetic dataset on the basis of OHIE. It is common practice in causal inference literature to use semi-synthetic data for evaluation, because it combines advantages of both synthetic and real-world data. On the one hand, the real-world data part ensures that the data distribution is realistic and matches those in practice. On the other hand, the counterfactual ground-truth is still available, which makes it possible to measure the performance of ITE methods. We construct our semi-synthetic data as follows: First, we extract the covariates X \u2208 R5 and instruments Z \u2208 {0, 1} of our OHIE dataset from Sec. E. Then, we construct the treatment components \u00b5Ai (x) via \u00b5A1 (X) = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3(X1) + 0.7 and \u00b5A0 (X) = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3(X1), (60) where X1 is the (standardized) age and \u03c3(\u00b7) is the sigmoid function. The outcome components are constructed via \u00b5Y1 (X) = 0.5X 2 1 + 5\u2211 i=2 X2i and \u00b5 Y 0 (X) = \u22120.5X21 + 5\u2211 i=2 X2i . (61) We then sample treatments A and outcomes Y as in Eq. (38) and Eq. (39). Lemma 2 ensures that \u00b5Yi (X) = E[Y | Z = i,X] and \u00b5Ai (X) = E[A | Z = i,X]. Given the above, the oracle ITE becomes \u03c4(X) = X21 0.7 . (62) Note that \u03c4(X) is sparse in the sense that it only depends on age, while the outcome components depend on all five covariates. Following our theoretical analysis in Sec. C, MRIV-Net should thus outperform methods that aim at estimating the components directly. This is confirmed in Table 7, where we show the results for all baselines and MRIV-Net on the semi-synthetic data. Indeed, we observe that MRIV-Net outperforms all other baselines, confirming both the superiority of our method as well as our theoretical results under sparsity assumptions from Sec. C. J RESULTS FOR CROSS-FITTING: Here, we repeat our experiments from the main paper but now make use of cross-fitting. Recall that, in Theorem 2, we assume that the nuisance parameter estimation and the pseudo-outcome regression are performed on three independent samples. We now address this through cross-fitting. To this end, our aim is to show that our proposed MRIV framework is again superior. For MRIV, we proceeded as follows: We split the sample D into three equally sized samples D1, D2, and D3. We then trained \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) on D1, \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x) on D2, and performed the pseudo-outcome regression on D3. Then, we repeated the same training procedure two times, but performed the pseudo-outcome regression on D2 and D1. Finally, we averaged the resulting three ITE estimators. For DRIV, we implemented the cross-fitting procedure described in (Syrgkanis et al., 2019). For the DR-learner, we followed (Kennedy, 2022). The results are in Table 8. Importantly, the results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed MRIV. Overall, we find that our proposed MRIV outperforms DRIV for the vast majority of base methods when performing cross-fitting. Furthermore, MRIV-Net is highly competitive even when comparing it with the cross-fitted estimators. This shows that our heuristic to learn separate representations instead of performing sample splits works in practice. In sum, the results confirm empirically that our MRIV is superior.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: Estimating individual treatment effects under unobserved confounding using binary instruments\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Individual treatment effects (ITEs) are relevant across many disciplines such as marketing (Varian, 2016) and personalized medicine (Yazdani & Boerwinkle, 2015). Knowledge about ITEs provides insights into the heterogeneity of treatment effects, and thus help in potentially better treatment decisions. Many recent works that use machine learning to estimate ITEs are based on the assumption of unconfoundedness (Alaa & van der Schaar, 2017; Lim et al., 2018; Shalit et al., 2017; Wager & Athey, 2018), In practice, however, this assumption is often violated because it is common that some confounders are not reported in the data. Typical examples are race, income, gender, or the socioeconomic status of patients, which are not stored in medical files. If the confounding is sufficiently strong, standard methods for estimating ITEs suffer from confounding bias (Pearl, 2009), which may lead to inferior treatment decisions. To handle unobserved confounders, instrumental variables (IVs) can be leveraged to relax the assumption of unconfoundedness and still compute reliable ITE estimates. IV methods were originally developed in economics (Wright, 1928), but, only recently, there is a growing interest in combining IV methods with machine learning (see Sec. 3). Importantly, IV methods outperform classical ITE estimators if a sufficient amount of confounding is not observed (Hartford et al., 2017). We thus aim at estimating ITEs from observational data under unobserved confounding using IVs. In this paper, we consider the setting where a single binary instrument is available. This setting is widespread in personalized medicine (and other applications such as marketing or public policy) (Bloom et al., 1997). In fact, the setting is encountered in essentially all observational or randomized studies with observed non-compliance (Imbens & Angrist, 1994). As an example, consider a randomized controlled trial (RCT), where treatments are randomly assigned to patients and their outcomes are observed. Due to some potentially unobserved confounders (e.g., income, education), some patients refuse to take the treatment initially assigned to them. Here, the treatment assignment serves as a binary IV. Moreover, such RCTs have been widely used by public decision-makers, e.g., to analyze the effect of health insurance on health outcome (see the so-called Oregon health insurance experiment) (Finkelstein et al., 2012) or the effect of military service on lifetime earnings (Angrist, 1990). We propose a novel machine learning framework (called MRIV) for estimating ITEs using binary IVs. Our framework takes an initial ITE estimator and nuisance parameter estimators as input to perform a pseudo-outcome regression. Importantly, our framework uses a multiply robust parametrization of the efficient influence function as pseudo outcome. We provide a theoretical analysis, where we use tools from Kennedy (2022) to show that our framework achieves a multiply robust convergence rate, i.e., our MRIV converges with a fast rate even if several nuisance parameters converge slowly. We further show that, compared to existing plug-in IV methods, the performance of our framework is asymptotically superior. Finally, we leverage our framework and, on top of it, build a tailored deep neural network called MRIV-Net. Differences to existing literature: Our framework is multiply robust1, i.e., we show that it is consistent in the union of three different model specifications. This is different from existing methods for ITE estimation using IVs such as Okui et al. (2012), Syrgkanis et al. (2019), or plug-in estimators (Bargagli-Stoffi et al., 2021; Imbens & Angrist, 1994). Contributions: (1) We propose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework (called MRIV) to learn the ITE using the binary IV setting. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first that is shown to be multiply robust, i.e., consistent in the union of three model specifications. For comparison, existing works for ITE estimation only show double robustness (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018; Syrgkanis et al., 2019). (2) We prove that MRIV achieves a multiply robust convergence rate. This is different to methods for IV settings which do not provide robust convergence rates (Syrgkanis et al., 2019). We further show that our MRIV is asymptotically superior to existing plug-in estimators. (3) We propose a tailored deep neural network, called MRIV-Net, which builds upon our framework to estimate ITEs. We demonstrate that MRIV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. 2 PROBLEM SETUP: Data generating process: We observe data D = (xi, zi, ai, yi)ni=1 consisting of n \u2208 N observations of the tuple (X,Z,A, Y ). Here, X \u2208 X are observed confounders, Z \u2208 {0, 1} is a binary instrument, A \u2208 {0, 1} is a binary treatment, and Y \u2208 R is an outcome of interest. Furthermore, we assume the existence of unobserved confounders U \u2208 U , which affect both the treatment A and the outcome Y . The causal graph is shown in Fig. 1. Applicability: Our proposed framework is widely applicable in practice, namely to all settings with the above data generating process. This includes both (1) observational data and (2) RCTs with non-compliance. For (1), observational data is commonly encountered in, e.g., personalized medicine. Here, modeling treatments as binary variables is consistent with previous literature on causal effect estimation and standard in medical practice (Robins et al., 2000). For (2), our setting is further encountered in RCTs when the instrument Z is a randomized treatment assignment but individuals do not comply with their treatment assignment. Such RCTs have been extensively used by public decision-makers, e.g., to analyze the effect of health insurance on health outcome (Finkelstein et al., 2012) or the effect of military service on lifetime earnings (Angrist, 1990). We build upon the potential outcomes framework (Rubin, 1974) for modeling causal effects. Let Y (a, z) denote the potential outcome that would have been observed under A = a and Z = z. Following previous 1For a detailed introduction to multiple robustness and its importance in treatment effect estimation, we refer to (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018), Section 4.5. literature on IV estimation (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018), we impose the following standard IV assumptions on the data generating process. Assumption 1 (Standard IV assumptions (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018; Wooldridge, 2013)). We assume: (1) Exclusion: Y (a, z) = Y (a) for all a, z \u2208 {0, 1}, i.e., the instrument has no direct effect on the patient outcome; (2) Independence: Z \u22a5\u22a5 U | X; (3) Relevance: Z \u22a5\u0338\u22a5 A | X , (iv) The model includes all A\u2013Y confounder: Y (a) \u22a5\u22a5 (A,Z) | (X,U) for all a \u2208 {0, 1}. Assumption 1 is standard for IV methods and fulfilled in practical settings where IV methods are applied (Angrist, 1990; Angrist & Krueger, 1991; Imbens & Angrist, 1994). Note that Assumption 1 does not prohibit the existence of unobserved Z\u2013A confounders. On the contrary, it merely prohibits the existence of unobserved counfounders that affect all Z, A, and Y simultaneously, as it is standard in IV settings (Wooldridge, 2013). A practical and widespread example where Assumption 1 is satisfied are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with non-compliance (Imbens & Angrist, 1994). Here, the treatment assignment Z is randomized, but the actual relationship between treatment A and outcome Y may still be confounded. For instance, in the Oregon health insurance experiment (Finkelstein et al., 2012), people were given access to health insurance (Z) by a lottery with aim to study the effect of health insurance (A) on health outcome (Y ) (Finkelstein et al., 2012). Here, non-compliance information is observed because the lottery winners needed to sign up for health insurance. Objective: In this paper, we are interested in estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE) \u03c4(x) = E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X = x]. (1) If there is no unobserved confounding (U = \u2205), the ITE is identifiable from observational data (Shalit et al., 2017). However, in practice, it is often unlikely that all confounders are observable. To account for this, we leverage the instrument Z to identify the ITE. We state the following assumption for identifiability. Assumption 2 (Identifiability of the ITE (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018)). At least one of the following two statements holds true: (1) E[A | Z = 1, X, U ]\u2212 E[A | Z = 0, X, U ] = E[A | Z = 1, X]\u2212 E[A | Z = 0, X]; or (2) E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X,U ] = E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X]. Example: Assumption 1 holds is when the function f(a,X,U) = E[Y (a) | X,U ] is additive with respect to a and U , e.g., f(a,X,U) = g(a,X) + h(U) for measurable functions h and g. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the ITE is identifiable (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). It can be written as \u03c4(x) = \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) \u00b5A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) = \u03b4Y (x) \u03b4A(x) , (2) where \u00b5Yi (x) = E[Y | Z = i,X = x] and \u00b5Ai (x) = E[A | Z = i,X = x]. Even if Assumption 2 does not hold, the quantity on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) still allows for interpretation. If no unobserved Z\u2013A confounders exist, it can be interpreted as conditional version of the local average treatment effect (LATE) (Imbens & Angrist, 1994) under a monotonicity assumption. Furthermore, under a no-current-treatment-value-interaction assumption, it can be interpreted as conditional treatment effect on the treated (ETT) (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018).2 This has an important implication for our results: If Assumption 2 does not hold in practice, our estimates still provide conditional LATE or ETT estimates under the respective assumptions because they are based on Eq. (2). If Assumption 2 does hold, all three \u2013 i.e., ITE, conditional LATE, and ETT \u2013 coincide (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). 3 RELATED WORK: Machine learning methods for IV: Only recently, machine learning has been integrated into IV methods. These are: Singh et al. (2019) and Xu et al. (2021a) generalize 2SLS by learning complex feature maps using kernel methods and deep learning, respectively. Hartford et al. (2017) adopts a two-stage neural network architecture that performs the first stage via conditional density estimation. 2The conditional LATE measures the ITE for individuals which are part of the complier subpopulation, i.e., for whom A(Z = 1) > A(Z = 0). The conditional ETT measures the ITE for treated individuals. Bennett et al. (2019) leverages moment conditions for IV estimation. However, the aforementioned methods are not specifically designed for the binary IV setting but, rather, for multiple IVs or treatment scenarios. In particular, they impose stronger assumptions such as additive confounding in order to identify the ITE. Note that additive confounding is a special case of when our Assumption 2 holds. Moreover, they do not have robustness properties. In the binary IV setting, current methods proceed by estimating \u00b5Yi (x) and \u00b5 A i (x) separately, before plugging them in Eq. 2 (Imbens & Angrist, 1994; Angrist et al., 1996; Bargagli-Stoffi et al., 2021). As result, these suffer from plug-in bias and do not offer robustness properties. Doubly robust IV methods: Doubly robust estimators are commonly used in causal inference as they allow for consistent estimation under model misspecification and fast convergence rates (Kennedy, 2022). Recently, they also have been adopted for IV settings: Kennedy et al. (2019) propose a pseudo regression estimator for the local average treatment effect using continuous instruments, which has been extended to individual effects by Semenova & Chernozhukov (2021). Furthermore, Singh & Sun (2019) use a doubly robust approach to estimate average compiler parameters. Finally, Ogburn et al. (2015) and Syrgkanis et al. (2019) propose doubly robust ITE estimators in the IV setting which both rely on doubly robust parametrizations of the uncentered efficient influence function (Okui et al., 2012). However, none of these estimators has been shown to be multiply robust in the sense that they are consistent in the union of more than two model specifications (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). Multiply robust IV methods: Multiply robust estimators for IV settings have been proposed only for average treatment effects (ATEs) (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018) and optimal treatment regimes (Cui & Tchetgen, 2021) but not for ITEs. In particular, Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018) derive a multiply robust parametrization of the efficient influence function for the ATE. However, there exists no method that leverages this result for ITE estimation. We provide a detailed, technical comparison of existing methods and our framework in Appendix F. Research gap: To the best of our knowledge, there exists no method for ITE estimation under unobserved confounding that has been shown to be multiply robust. To fill this gap, we propose MRIV: a multiply robust machine learning framework tailored to the binary IV setting. For this, we build upon the approach by Kennedy (2022) to derive robust convergence rates, yet this approach has not been adapted to IV settings, which is our contribution. 4 MRIV FOR ESTIMATING ITES USING BINARY INSTRUMENTS: In the following, we present our MRIV framework for estimating ITEs under unobserved confounding (Sec. 4.1). We then derive an asymptotic convergence rate for MRIV (Sec. 4.2) and finally use our framework to develop a tailored deep neural network called MRIV-Net (Sec. 4.4). 4.1 FRAMEWORK: Motivation: A na\u0131\u0308ve approach to estimate the ITE is to leverage the identification result in Eq. (2). Assuming that we have estimated the nuisance components \u00b5\u0302Yi and \u00b5\u0302 A i for i \u2208 {0, 1}, we can simply plug them into Eq. (2) to obtain the so-called (plug-in) Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W(x) (Wald, 1940). However, in practice, the true ITE curve \u03c4(x) is often simpler (e.g., smoother, more sparse) than its complements \u00b5Yi (x) or \u00b5 A i (x) (Ku\u0308nzel et al., 2019). In this case, \u03c4\u0302W(x) is inefficient because it models all components separately, and, to address this, our proposed framework estimates \u03c4 directly using a pseudo outcome regression. Overview: We now propose MRIV. MRIV is a two-stage meta learner that takes any base method for ITE estimation as input. For instance, the base method could be the Wald estimator from Eq. (2), any other IV method such as 2SLS, or a deep neural network (as we propose in our MRIV-Net later in Sec. 4.4). In Stage 1, MRIV produces nuisance estimators \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), and \u03c0\u0302(x), where \u03c0\u0302(x) is an estimator of the propensity score \u03c0(x) = P(Z = 1 | X = x). In Stage 2, MRIV estimates \u03c4(x) directly using a pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR as a regression target. Given an arbitrary initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) and nuisance estimates \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), and \u03c0\u0302(x), we define the pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR = ( Z\u2212(1\u2212Z) \u03b4\u0302A(X) )( Y\u2212(\u00b5\u0302Y0 (X)+\u03c4\u0302init(X) (A\u2212\u00b5\u0302 A 0 (X))) Z \u03c0\u0302(X)+(1\u2212Z)(1\u2212\u03c0\u0302(X)) ) + \u03c4\u0302init(X). (3) Algorithm 1: MRIV Input : data (X,Z,A, Y ), initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) // Stage 1: Estimate nuisance components \u03c0\u0302(x)\u2190 E\u0302[Z | X = x], \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2190 E\u0302[Y | X = x, Z = 0], \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2190 E\u0302[A | X = x, Z = 0] \u03b4\u0302A(x)\u2190 E\u0302[A | X = x, Z = 1]\u2212 E\u0302[A | X = x, Z = 0] // Stage 2: Pseudo outcome regression Y\u0302MR \u2190( Z\u2212(1\u2212Z) \u03b4\u0302A(X) )( Y \u2212A \u03c4\u0302init(X)\u2212\u00b5\u0302 Y 0 (X)+\u00b5\u0302 A 0 (X) \u03c4\u0302init(X) Z \u03c0\u0302(X)+(1\u2212Z)(1\u2212\u03c0\u0302(X)) ) + \u03c4\u0302init(X) \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2190 E\u0302[Y\u0302MR | X = x] The pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR in Eq. (3) is a multiply robust parameterization of the (uncentered) efficient influence function for the average treatment effect EX [\u03c4(X)] (see the derivation in (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018)). Once we have obtained the pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR, we regress it on X to obtain the Stage 2 MRIV estimator \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) for \u03c4(x). The pseudocode for MRIV is given in Algorithm 1. MRIV can be interpreted as a way to remove plug-in bias from \u03c4\u0302init(x) (Curth et al., 2020). Using the fact that Y\u0302MR is a multiply robust parametrization of the efficient influence function, we derive a multiple robustness property of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x). Theorem 1 (multiple robustness property). Let \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302A0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), \u03c0\u0302(x), and \u03c4\u0302init(x) denote estimators of \u00b5Y0 (x), \u00b5 A 0 (x), \u03b4A(x), \u03c0(x), and \u03c4(x), respectively. Then, for all x \u2208 X , it holds that E[Y\u0302MR | X = x] = \u03c4(x),if least one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) \u00b5\u0302Y0 = \u00b5Y0 , \u00b5\u0302A0 = \u00b5A0 , and \u03c4\u0302init = \u03c4 ; or (2) \u03c0\u0302 = \u03c0 and \u03b4\u0302A = \u03b4A; or (3) \u03c0\u0302 = \u03c0 and \u03c4\u0302init = \u03c4 . Theorem 1 implies that \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) is consistent for \u03c4(x) if either condition (1), (2), or (3) holds. As a result, our MRIV framework is multiply robust in the sense that our estimator, \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x), is consistent in the union of three different model specifications. Importantly, this is different from doubly robust estimators which are only consistent in the union of two model specifications (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018). Our MRIV is directly applicable to RCTs with non-compliance: Here, the treatment assignment is randomized and the propensity score \u03c0(x) is known. Our MRIV framework can be thus adopted by plugging in the known \u03c0(x) into the pseudo outcome in Eq. (3). Moreover, \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) is already consistent if either \u03c4\u0302init(x) or \u03b4\u0302A(x) are. 4.2 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS: In the following, we derive the asymptotic convergence rate of MRIV under smoothness assumptions. For this, we define s-smooth functions as functions contained in the Ho\u0308lder class H(s), associated with Stone\u2019s minimax rate (Stone, 1980) of n\u22122s/(2s+p), where p is the dimension of X . Assumption 3 (Smoothness). We assume that (1) the nuisance component \u00b5Y0 (\u00b7) is \u03b1-smooth, \u00b5A0 (\u00b7) is \u03b2-smooth, \u03c0(\u00b7) is \u03b3-smooth, and \u03b4A(\u00b7) is \u03b4-smooth; (2) all nuisance components are estimated with their respective minimax rate of n \u22122k 2k+p , where k \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4}; and (3) the oracle ITE \u03c4(\u00b7) is \u03b7-smooth and the initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init converges with rate r\u03c4 (n). Assumption 3 for smoothness provides us with a way to quantify the difficulty of the underlying nonparametric regression problems. Similar assumptions have been imposed for asymptotic analysis of previous ITE estimators in (Kennedy, 2022; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). They can be replaced with other assumptions such as assumptions on the level of sparsity of the ITE components. We also provide an asymptotic analysis under sparsity assumptions (see Appendix C). We additionally impose the following boundedness assumptions on the the underlying data generating process and estimators. Assumption 4 (Boundedness). We assume that there exist constants C, \u03c1, \u03c1\u0303, \u03f5,K > 0 such that for all x \u2208 X it holds that: (1) |\u00b5Yi (x)| \u2264 C; (2) |\u03b4A(x)| = |\u00b5A1 (x) \u2212 \u00b5A0 (x)| \u2265 \u03c1 and |\u03b4\u0302A(x)| \u2265 \u03c1\u0303; (3) \u03f5 \u2264 \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03f5; and (4) |\u03c4\u0302init(x)| \u2264 K. Assumptions 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4 are standard and in line with previous works on theoretical analyses of ITE estimators (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Kennedy, 2022). Assumption 4.2 ensures that both the oracle ITE and the estimator are bounded. Violations of Assumption 4.2 may occur when working with so-called \u201cweak\u201d instruments, which are IVs that are only weakly correlated with the treatment. Using IV methods with weak instruments should generally be avoided (Li et al., 2022). However, in many applications such as RCTs with non-compliance, weak instruments are unlikely to occur as patients\u2019 decisions to follow the treatment are generally correlated with the initial treatment assignments. We state now our main theoretical result: an upper bound on the oracle risk of the MRIV estimator. To derive our bound, we leverage the sample splitting approach from (Kennedy, 2022). The approach in (Kennedy, 2022) has been initially used to analyze the DR-learner for ITE estimation under unconfoundedness and allows for the derivation of robust convergence rates. It has later been adapted to several other meta learners (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021), yet not for IV methods. Theorem 2 (Oracle upper bound under smoothness). Let D\u2113 for \u2113 \u2208 {1, 2, 3} be independent samples of size n. Let \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x) be trained on D1, and let \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x) be trained on D2. We denote Y\u0302MR as the pseudo outcome from Eq. (3) and \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) = E\u0302n[Y\u0302MR | X = x] as the pseudo outcome regression on D3 for some generic estimator E\u0302n[\u00b7 | X = x] of E[\u00b7 | X = x]. We assume that the second-stage estimator E\u0302n yields the minimax rate n\u2212 2\u03b7 2\u03b7+p and satisfies the stability assumption from Kennedy (2022), Proposition 1 (see Appendix B). Then, the oracle risk is upper bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p+r\u03c4 (n) ( n \u22122\u03b3 2\u03b3+p + n \u22122\u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) +n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p )+n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ). Proof. See Appendix B. Recall that the first summand of the lower bound in Eq. (2) is the minimax rate for the oracle ITE \u03c4(x) which cannot be improved upon. Hence, for a fast convergence rate of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x), it is sufficient if either: (1) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b1, \u03b2 are large; (2) \u03b3 and \u03b4 are large; or (3) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b3 is large. This is in line with the multiply robustness property of MRIV (Theorem 1) and means that MRIV achieves a fast rate of convergence even if the initial estimator or several nuisance estimators converge slowly. Improvement over \u03c4\u0302init(x): From the bound in Eq. (2), it follows that \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) improves on the convergence rate of the initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) if its rate r\u03c4 (n) is lower bounded by r\u03c4 (n) \u2273 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p + n\u22122 ( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ) + n\u22122 ( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ). (4) Hence, our MRIV estimator is more likely to improve on the initial estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) if either (1) \u03b3 is large or (2) \u03b1 and \u03b2 are large. Note that the margin of improvement depends also on the size of \u03b3 and \u03b4, i.e., on the smoothness of \u03c0(x) and \u03b4A(x). In fact, this is widely fulfilled in practice. For example, the former is fulfilled for RCTs with non-compliance, where \u03c0(x) is often some known, fixed number p \u2208 (0, 1). Hence, for RCTs with non-compliance, MRIV should (at least asymptotically) improve the performance of most estimators. 4.3 MRIV VS. WALD ESTIMATOR: In the following, we compare \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) to the Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W(x). First, we derive corresponding upper bound under smoothness. Theorem 3 (Wald oracle upper bound). Assume that \u00b5Y1 (x), \u00b5Y0 (x) are \u03b1-smooth, \u00b5A1 (x), \u00b5A0 (x) are \u03b2-smooth, and are estimated with their respective minimax rate. Let \u03b4\u0302A(x) = \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) satisfy Assumption 4. Then, the oracle risk of the Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W (x) is bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n\u2212 2\u03b1 2\u03b1+p + n\u2212 2\u03b2 2\u03b2+p . (5) Proof. See Appendix B. We now consider the MRIV estimator \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) with \u03c4\u0302init = \u03c4\u0302W(x), i.e., initialized with the Wald estimator (under sample splitting). Plugging the Wald rate from Eq. (5) into the Eq. (2) yields E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p + n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b3 2\u03b3+p ). For\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03b4, the rates of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) and \u03c4\u0302W(x) reduce to E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b7 2\u03b7+p+ n \u22124\u03b1 2\u03b1+p and E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p . Hence, \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) outperforms \u03c4\u0302W(x) asymptotically for \u03b7 > \u03b1, i.e., when the ITE \u03c4(x) is smoother than its components, which is usually the case in practice (Ku\u0308nzel et al., 2019). For \u03b7 = \u03b1, the rates of both estimators coincide. Hence, we should expect MRIV to improve on the Wald estimator in real-world settings with large sample size. 4.4 MRIV-NET: Based on our MRIV framwork, we develop a tailored deep neural network called MRIV-Net for ITE estimation using IVs. Our MRIV-Net produces both an initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) and nuisance estimators \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x), and \u03c0\u0302(x). For MRIV-Net, we choose deep neural networks for the nuisance components due to their predictive power and their ability to learn complex shared representations for several nuisance components. Sharing representations between nuisance components has been exploited previously for ITE estimation, yet only under unconfoundedness (Shalit et al., 2017; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). Building shared representations is more efficient in finite sample regimes than estimating all nuisance components separately as they usually share some common structure. In MRIV-Net, not all nuisance components should share a representation. Recall that, in Theorem 2, we assumed that (1) \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302A0 (x); and (2) \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x) are trained on two independent samples in order to derive the upper bound on the oracle risk. Hence, we propose to build two separate representations \u03a61 and \u03a62, so that (i) \u03a61 is used to learn \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x), and (ii) \u03a62 is used to learn \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x). This ensures that the nuisance estimators (1) share minimal information with nuisance estimators (2) even though they are estimated on the same data. Intuitively, this should lead to a faster decay of the oracle upper bound (cf. (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021)). The architecture of MRIV-Net is shown in Fig. 2. MRIV-Net takes the observed covariatesX as input to build the two representations \u03a61 and \u03a62. The first representation \u03a61 is used to output estimates \u00b5\u0302Y1 (x), \u00b5\u0302 Y 0 (x), \u00b5\u0302 A 1 (x), and \u00b5\u0302 A 0 (x) of the ITE components. The second representation \u03a62 is used to output estimates \u00b5\u0303A1 (x), \u00b5\u0303 A 0 (x), and \u03c0\u0302(x). MRIV-Net is trained by minimizing an overall loss L(\u03b8) = \u2211n i=1 [( \u00b5\u0302Yzi(xi)\u2212 yi )2 +BCE ( \u00b5\u0302Azi(xi), ai ) +BCE ( \u00b5\u0303Azi(xi), ai ) +BCE (\u03c0\u0302(xi), zi) ] , (6) where \u03b8 denotes the neural network parameters and BCE is the binary cross entropy loss. After training MRIV-Net, we obtain the \u03c4\u0302init(x) = \u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212\u00b5\u0302 Y 0 (x) \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212\u00b5\u0302A0 (x) and obtain the nuisance estimators \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302A0 (x), \u03b4\u0302A(x) = \u00b5\u0303 A 1 (x) \u2212 \u00b5\u0303A0 (x) and \u03c0\u0302(x). Then, we perform, we perform the pseudo regression (Stage 2) of MRIV to obtain \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x). Implementation: We use PyTorch Lightning for our implementation and train MRIV-Net with the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015). Details on the network architecture and hyperparameter tuning are in Appendix H. We perform both the training of MRIV-Net and the pseudo outcome regression on the full training data. Needless to say, MRIV-Net can be easily adopted for sample splitting or cross-fitting procedures as in Chernozhukov et al. (2018), namely, by learning separate networks for each representation \u03a61 and \u03a62. In our experiments, we do not use sample splitting or cross-fitting, as this can affect the performance in finite sample regimes. Of note, our choice is consistent with previous work (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). In Appendix J we report results using cross-fitting. 5 COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS:  5.1 SIMULATED DATA: In causal inference literature, it is common practice to use simulated data for performance evaluations (Bica et al., 2020a; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Hartford et al., 2017). Simulated data offers the crucial benefit that it provides ground-truth information on the counterfactual outcomes and thus allows for direct benchmarking against the oracle ITE. Data generation: We generate simulated data by sampling the oracle ITE \u03c4(x) and the nuisance components \u00b5Yi (x), \u00b5 A i (x), and \u03c0(x) from Gaussian process priors. Using Gaussian processes has the following advantages: (1) It allows for a fair method comparison, as there is no need to explicitly specify the nuisance components, which could lead to unwanted inductive biases favoring a specific method; (2) the sampled nuisance components are non-linear and thus resemble real-world scenarios where machine learning methods would be applied; and, (3) by sampling from the prior induced by the Mate\u0301rn kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2008), we can control the smoothness of the nuisance components, which allows us to confirm our theoretical results from Sec. 4.2. For a detailed description of our data generating process, we refer to Appendix D. Baselines: We compare our MRIV-Net with state-of-the-art IV baselines. Details regarding baselines and nuisance parameter estimation are in Appendix F. Note that many of the baselines do not directly aim at ITE estimation but rather at counterfactual outcome prediction. We nevertheless use these methods as baselines and, for this, obtain the ITE by taking the difference between the predictions of the factual and counterfactual outcomes.

Lower = better (best in bold) Performance evaluation: For all experiments, we use a 80/20 split as training/test set. We calcalute the root mean squared errors (RMSE) between the ITE estimates and the oracle ITE on the test set. We report the mean RMSE and the standard deviation over five data sets generated from random seeds. Results: Table 2 shows the results for all baselines. Here, the DR-learner does not improve the performance of TARNet, which is reasonable as both the DRlearner and TARNet assume unconfoundedness and are thus biased in our setting. Our MRIV-Net outperforms all baselines. Our MRIV-Net also achieves a smaller standard deviation. For additional results, we refer to Appendix I. We further compare the performance of two different meta-learner frameworks \u2013 DRIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) and our MRIV\u2013 across different base methods. The results are in Table 3. The nuisance parameters are estimated using feed forward neural networks (DRIV) or TAR- Table 3: Base model with different meta-learners (i.e., none, DRIV, and our MRIV). n = 3000 n = 5000 n = 8000 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhBase methods Meta-learners None DRIV MRIV (ours) None DRIV MRIV (ours) None DRIV MRIV (ours) (1) STANDARD ITE TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) 0.76\u00b1 0.14 0.31 \u00b1 0.05 0.34\u00b1 0.13 0.70\u00b1 0.12 0.17 \u00b1 0.06 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 0.69\u00b1 0.17 0.21\u00b1 0.04 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 (2) GENERAL IV 2SLS (Wooldridge, 2013) 1.22\u00b1 0.23 0.40\u00b1 0.11 0.31 \u00b1 0.08 0.79\u00b1 0.37 0.17 \u00b1 0.09 0.19\u00b1 0.05 1.12\u00b1 0.29 0.21\u00b1 0.05 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 KIV (Singh et al., 2019) 1.54\u00b1 0.53 0.40\u00b1 0.10 0.39 \u00b1 0.11 1.18\u00b1 1.14 0.20\u00b1 0.08 0.17 \u00b1 0.06 3.80\u00b1 4.71 0.31\u00b1 0.18 0.28 \u00b1 0.19 DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a) 0.43\u00b1 0.11 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 0.27\u00b1 0.07 0.40\u00b1 0.21 0.18\u00b1 0.09 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 0.46\u00b1 0.54 0.21\u00b1 0.06 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017) 0.96\u00b1 0.30 0.27\u00b1 0.03 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 0.28\u00b1 0.09 0.18 \u00b1 0.08 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 0.23\u00b1 0.04 0.21\u00b1 0.03 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019) 0.95\u00b1 0.38 0.40\u00b1 0.15 0.36 \u00b1 0.13 0.37\u00b1 0.09 0.24\u00b1 0.12 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 0.42\u00b1 0.14 0.21\u00b1 0.03 0.17 \u00b1 0.03 DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) 1.92\u00b1 0.71 0.41\u00b1 0.12 0.37 \u00b1 0.11 0.92\u00b1 0.41 0.22\u00b1 0.05 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 1.14\u00b1 0.24 0.21\u00b1 0.06 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 (3) WALD ESTIMATOR (WALD, 1940) Linear 1.06\u00b1 0.63 0.42\u00b1 0.15 0.38 \u00b1 0.14 0.62\u00b1 0.22 0.19 \u00b1 0.09 0.25\u00b1 0.09 0.81\u00b1 0.34 0.19\u00b1 0.09 0.18 \u00b1 0.04 BART 0.95\u00b1 0.30 0.48\u00b1 0.14 0.46 \u00b1 0.12 0.63\u00b1 0.33 0.26\u00b1 0.13 0.20 \u00b1 0.07 0.88\u00b1 0.28 0.31\u00b1 0.08 0.29 \u00b1 0.04 MRIV-Net\\w network only (ours) 0.39\u00b1 0.13 0.35\u00b1 0.12 0.26 \u00b1 0.11 0.31\u00b1 0.04 0.19\u00b1 0.13 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 0.26\u00b1 0.06 0.18\u00b1 0.08 0.13 \u00b1 0.03 Reported: RMSE (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Lower = better (best improvement over none meta-learner in bold) Nets with either binary or continuous outputs (MRIV). Our MRIV improves over the variant without any meta-learner framework across all base methods (both in terms of RMSE and standard deviation). Furthermore, MRIV is clearly superior over DRIV. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our MRIV across different base methods (note: MRIV with an arbitrary base model is typically superior to DRIV with our custom network from above). MRIV-Net is overall best. We also performed additional experiments where we used semi-synthetic data and crossfitting approaches for both meta-learners (see Appendix I and J). Ablation study: Table 4 compares different variants of our MRIV-Net. These are: (1) MRIV but network only; (2) MRIV-Net with a single representation for all nuisance estimators; and (3) our MRIV-Net from above. We observe that MRIV-Net is best. This justifies our proposed network architecture for MRIV-Net. Hence, combing the result from above, our performance gain must be attributed to both our framework and the architecture of our deep neural network. Robustness checks for unobserved confounding and smoothness: Here, we demonstrate the importance of handling unobserved confounding (as we do in our MRIV framework). For this, Fig. 3 plots the results for our MRIV-Net vs. standard ITE without customization for confounding (i.e., TARNet with and without the DR-learner) over over different levels of unobserved confounding. The RMSE of both TARNet variants increase almost linearly with increasing confounding. In contrast, the RMSE of our MRIV-Net only marginally. Even for low confounding regimes, our MRIV-Net performs competitively. Fig. 4 varies the smoothness level. This is given by \u03b1 of \u00b5Yi (\u00b7) (controlled by the Mate\u0301rn kernel prior). Here, the performance decreases for the baselines, i.e., DeepIV and our network without MRIV framework. In contrast, the peformance of our MRIV-Net remains robust and outperforms the baselines. This confirms our theoretical results from above. It thus indicates that our MRIV framework works best when the oracle ITE \u03c4(x) is smoother than the nuisance parameters \u00b5Yi (x). 5.2 CASE STUDY WITH REAL-WORLD DATA: Setting: We demonstrate effectiveness of our framework using a case study with real-world, medical data. Here, we use medical data from the so-called Oregon health insurance experiment (OHIE) (Finkelstein et al., 2012). It provides data for an RCT with non-compliance: In 2008, \u223c30,000 low-income, uninsured adults in Oregon were offered participation in a health insurance program by a lottery. Individuals whose names were drawn could decide to sign up for health insurance. After a period of 12 months, in-person interviews took place to evaluate the health condition of the respective participant. 20 40 60 Age 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 Es tim at ed IT E gender = male 20 40 60 Age gender = female Method TARNet MRIV-Net\\w netowrk only MRIV-Net (ours) DMLIV + DRIV Figure 5: Results on real-world medical data. In our analysis, the lottery assignment is the instrument Z, the decision to sign up for health insurance is treatment A, and an overall health score is the outcome Y . We also include five covariates X , including age and gender. For details, we refer to Appendix E. We first estimate the ITE function and then report the treatment effect heterogeneity w.r.t. age and gender, while fixing the other covariates. The results for MRIV-Net, our neural network architecture without the MRIV framework, and TARNet are in Fig. 5. Results: Our MRIV-Net estimates larger causal effects for an older age. In contrast, TARNet does not estimate positive ITEs even for an older age. Even though we cannot evaluate the estimation quality on real-world data, our estimates seem reasonable in light of the medical literature: the benefit of health insurance should increase with older age. This showcases that TARNet may suffer from bias induced by unobserved confounders. We also report the results for DRIV with DMLIV as base method, and observe that in contrast to MRIV-Net, the corresponding ITE does not vary much between ages. Interestingly, both our MRIV-Net estimate a somewhat smaller ITE for middle ages (around 30\u201350 yrs). One explanation might be that individual in this age group are more likely to have stable jobs and, thus, are also more likely to be able to afford medical care, decreasing the direct effect of health insurance on individuals health. In sum, the findings from our case study are of direct relevance for decision-makers in public health (Imbens & Angrist, 1994), and highlight the practical value of our framework. Reproducibility: Details for reproducing the experiment results can be found in the supplementary materials (Readme.md). A EXTENDED RELATED WORK: ITE methods without unconfoundedness: Various machine learning methods for estimating ITEs without unobserved confounding have been proposed in recent literature (Alaa & van der Schaar, 2017; Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Ku\u0308nzel et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2018; Shalit et al., 2017; Wager & Athey, 2018; Yoon et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). To remove plug-in bias, the DR-learner performs a second stage regression on the uncentered influence function of the average treatment effect (Kennedy, 2022). However, under unobserved confounding, all of these methods are biased (see Appendix F). As a result, this hampers their performance in our setting. Non-IV methods for unobserved confounding: There is a rich literature for causal effect estimation under unobserved confounding, which does not assume the existence of instrumental variables. Methods include deconfounding methods (Wang & Blei, 2019; Bica et al., 2020b), proxy learning methods (Cui et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021b), and causal sensitivity analysis (Kallus et al., 2019; Jesson et al., 2021).. Classical IV methods: IV methods address the problem of unobserved confounding by exploiting the variance in treatment and outcome induced by the instruments. Traditionally, two-stage least squares (2SLS) has been used for estimating causal effects (Wright, 1928; Angrist & Krueger, 1991). 2SLS was originally developed in economics, and follows a two-stage procedure: it performs a first stage regression of treatment A on the instrument Z, and then uses the fitted values for a second stage regression to predict the outcome Y . Several nonparametric methods have been developed in econometric to generalize 2SLS in order to account for non-linearities within the data (Newey & Powell, 2003; Wang et al., 2021), yet these are limited to low-dimensional settings. B PROOFS: We start by deriving an auxiliary Lemma. That is, we derive an explicit expression for the Stage 2 oracle pseudo outcome regression E[Y\u0302MR | X = x] of MRIV. Lemma 1.

(13) 2. E[Y\u0302MR | X = x] = ( \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ) \u03b4A(x) + ( \u00b5A0 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) ) \u03b4A(x) + \u03c4\u0302init(x) (14) = \u03b4Y (x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4A(x) \u03b4A(x) + \u03c4\u0302init(x) = \u03c4(x).

We refer to Kennedy (2022) (Proposition 1) for a detailed discussion on this assumption. Assumption 5 (From Proposition 1 of Kennedy (2022)). Let YMR be the corresponding oracle to the estimated pseudo-outcome Y\u0302MR. We assume that the pseudo-regression estimator E\u0302n satisfies E\u0302n[Y\u0302MR | X = x]\u2212 E\u0302n[YMR | X = x]\u2212 E\u0302n[Y\u0302MR \u2212 YMR | X = x]\u221a E [( E\u0302n[YMR | X = x]\u2212 E[YMR | X = x] )2] p\u2192 0 (18) and E [ E\u0302n[r\u0302(X) | X = x]2 ] \u224d E [ r\u0302(x)2 ] , (19) where r(x) = E[Y\u0302MR | X = x]\u2212 \u03c4(x) Proof of Theorem 2. Let YMR be the corresponding oracle to Y\u0302MR and define \u03c4\u0303MRIV(x) = E\u0302n[YMR | X = x]. Using Assumption 5, we can apply Proposition 1 of Kennedy (2022) and obtain E [ (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 R(x) + E [ r\u0302(x)2 ] , (20) where R(x) = E [ (\u03c4\u0303MR(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] is the oracle risk of the second stage regression. We can apply Lemma 1 to obtain r\u0302(x) = \u03c0(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) ( \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ) + (1\u2212 \u03c0(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) ( \u00b5A0 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) ) + \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ( \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03c0(x) 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x) ) + \u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x) (21) = ( \u00b5Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ) \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ( \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03c0(x) 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x) ) + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x)) + ( (\u00b5A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x)) \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ) \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + (\u00b5\u0302D0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5D0 (x)) \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) ( \u03c0(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03c0(x) 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x) ) (22) = \u03b4Y (x)\u03c0(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + ( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) ) (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x)) \u2212 \u03b4A(x)\u03c0(x) \u03c4\u0302init(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) ) \u03c4\u0302init(x) (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) (23) = (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) ) + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) ) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ] + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x)) + \u03c0(x)\u03b4A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x)\u03b4\u0302A(x) (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x)) (24) = (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x) \u03c0\u0302(x) (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) ) + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) ) \u03c4\u0302init(x) ] + (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x)) ( \u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x) ) \u03c0(x) + (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x)) (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x)) \u03b4\u0302A(x). (25) Applying the inequality (a+ b)2 \u2264 2(a2+ b2) together with Assumption 4 and the fact that \u03c0(x) \u2264 1 yields r\u0302(x)2 \u2264 4 \u03f54\u03c12 (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x))2 [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) )2 + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) )2 K2 ] + 4 (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x))2 ( \u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x) )2 + 4 (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x))2 (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x))2 . (26) By setting K\u0303 = max{K, 1}, we obtain r\u0302(x)2 \u2264 4K\u0303 2 \u03f54\u03c12 ( (\u03c0(x)\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(x))2 [( \u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) )2 + ( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) )2 + (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] + (\u03c4(x)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(x))2 ( \u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x) )2) . (27) Applying expectations on both sides yields E [ (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] (28) \u2272R(x) + E [ (\u03c4\u0302init(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ]( E [( \u03b4\u0302A(x)\u2212 \u03b4A(x) )2] + E [ (\u03c0\u0302(x)\u2212 \u03c0(x))2 ]) + E [ (\u03c0\u0302(x)\u2212 \u03c0(x))2 ] ( E [( \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x) )2] + E [( \u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x) )2]) , (29) because (\u03c0\u0302(x), \u03b4\u0302A(x)) \u22a5\u22a5 (\u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), \u00b5\u0302A0 (x), \u03c4\u0302init(x)) due to sample splitting. The claim follows now by applying Assumption 3. B.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 3 (CONVERGENCE RATE OF THE WALD ESTIMATOR) Proof. We define C\u0303 = max{C, 1} and obtain the upper bound (\u03c4\u0302W (x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 (30) = ( (\u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y1 (x)) \u03b4A(x) + (\u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)) \u03b4A(x) + (\u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x)) \u03b4Y (x) \u03b4A(x) \u03b4\u0302A(x) )2 (31) \u2264 4C\u0303 2 \u03c12\u03c1\u03032 [ (\u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y1 (x))2 + (\u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x))2 + (\u03b4A(x)\u2212 \u03b4\u0302A(x))2 ] (32) \u2264 8C\u0303 2 \u03c12\u03c1\u03032 [ (\u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y1 (x))2 + (\u00b5\u0302Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5Y0 (x))2 + (\u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A1 (x))2 +(\u00b5\u0302A0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x))2 ] , (33) where we used the inequality (a+ b)2 \u2264 2(a2 + b2) several times. Taking expectations and applying the smoothness assumptions yields the result. C THEORETICAL ANALYSIS UNDER SPARSITY ASSUMPTIONS: In Sec. 4.2, we analyzed MRIV theoretically by imposing smoothness assumptions on the underlying data generating process. In particular, we derived a multiple robust convergence rate and showed that MRIV outperforms the Wald estimator if the oracle ITE is smoother than its components. In this section, we derive similar results by relying on a different set of assumptions. Instead of using smoothness, we make assumptions on the level of sparsity of the ITE components. This assumption is often imposed in high-dimensional settings (n < p) and is in line with previous literature on analyzing ITE estimators (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021; Kennedy, 2022). In the following, we say a function f(x) is k-sparse, if it is linear in x \u2208 Rp and it only depends on k < min{n, p} predictors. (Yang & Tokdar, 2015) showed, that in this case the minimax rate of f(x) is given by k log(p)n . The linearity assumption can be relaxed to an additive structural assumption, which we omit here for simplicity. In the following, we replace the smoothness conditions in Assumption 3 with sparsity conditions. Assumption 6 (Sparsity). We assume that (1) the nuisance components \u00b5Yi (\u00b7) are \u03b1-sparse, \u00b5Ai (\u00b7) and \u03b4A(\u00b7) are \u03b2-sparse, and \u03c0(\u00b7) is \u03b4-sparse; (2) all nuisance components are estimated with their respective minimax rate of k log(p)n , where k \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4}; and (3) the oracle ITE \u03c4(\u00b7) is \u03b3-sparse and the initial ITE estimator \u03c4\u0302init converges with rate r\u03c4 (n). We restate now our result from Theorem 3 for MRIV using the sparsity assumption. Theorem 4 (MRIV upper bound under sparsity). We consider the same setting as in Theorem 2 under the sparsity assumption 6. If the second-stage estimator E\u0302n yields the minimax rate \u03b3 log(p)n and satisfies Assumption 5, the oracle risk is upper bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 \u03b3 log(p) n + r\u03c4 (n) (\u03b2 + \u03b4) log(p) n + (\u03b1+ \u03b2)\u03b4 log2(p) n2 . Proof. Follows immediately from the proof of Theorem 2, i.e., from Eq.(28) by applying Ass- 6. Again, we obtain a multiple robust convergence rate for MRIV in the sense that MRIV achieves a fast rate even if the initial estimator or several nuisance estimators converge slowly. More precisely, for a fast convergence rate of \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x), it is sufficient if either: (1) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b4 is small; (2) r\u03c4 (n) decreases fast and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small; or (3) all \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4 are small. We derive now the corresponding rate for the Wald estimator. Theorem 5 (Wald oracle upper bound). Given estimators \u00b5\u0302Yi (x) and \u00b5\u0302Ai (x). Let \u03b4\u0302A(x) = \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) satisfy Assumption 4. Then, under Assumption 6 the oracle risk of the Wald estimator \u03c4\u0302W (x) is bounded by E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 (\u03b1+ \u03b2) log(p) n (34) Proof. Follows immediately from the proof of Theorem 3, i.e., from Eq.(30) by applying Ass- 6. If \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b4, we obtain the rates E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 \u03b3 log(p) n + \u03b12 log2(p) n2 and E [ (\u03c4\u0302W(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 \u03b1 log(p) n , (35) which means that \u03c4\u0302MRIV(x) outperforms \u03c4\u0302W(x) for \u03b3 < \u03b1, i.e., if the oracle ITE is more sparse than its components. D SIMULATED DATA: In the following, we describe how we simulate synthetic data for the experiments in Sec. 5.1 from the main paper. As mentioned therein, we simulate the ITE components from Gaussian processes using the prior induced by the Matern kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2008) K\u2113,\u03bd(xi, xj) = 1 \u0393(\u03bd)2\u03bd\u22121 (\u221a 2\u03bd \u2113 \u2225xi \u2212 xj\u22252 )\u03bd K\u03bd (\u221a 2\u03bd \u2113 \u2225xi \u2212 xj\u22252 ) , (36) where \u0393(\u00b7) is the Gamma function and K\u03bd(\u00b7) is the modified Bessel function of second kind. Here, \u2113 is the length scale of the kernel and \u03bd controls the smoothness of the sampled functions. We set \u2113 = 1 and sample functions \u03b4Y \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b3), \u00b5Y0 \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b1), f1 \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b2), f0 \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b2) and g \u223c GP(0,K\u2113,\u03b2). Then, we define \u00b5Y1 = \u03b4Y + \u00b5Y0 , \u00b5A1 = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3 \u25e6 f1 + 0.7, \u00b5A0 = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3 \u25e6 f0, \u03b4A = \u00b5A1 \u2212 \u00b5A0 , \u00b5Y0 = c0\u03b4A, and \u03c0 = \u03c3 \u25e6 g. Finally, we set the oracle ITE to \u03c4 = \u00b5Y1 \u2212 \u00b5Y0 \u00b5A1 \u2212 \u00b5A0 = \u03b4Y \u03b4A . (37) Note that we can create a setup where the ITE \u03c4 is smoother than its components by using a small \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio. An example is shown in Fig. 6. In the following, we describe how we generate data the (X,Z,A, Y ) using the ITE components \u00b5Yi (x), \u00b5 A i (x), and \u03c0(x). We begin by sampling n observed confounder X \u223c N (0, 1), unobserved confounders U \u223c N ( 0, 0.22 ) , and instruments Z \u223c Bernoulli(\u03c0(X)). Then, we obtain treatments via A = Z 1{U + \u03f5A > \u03b11(X)}+ (1\u2212 Z)1{U + \u03f5A > \u03b10(X)} (38) with indicator function 1, noise \u03f5A \u223c N ( 0, 0.12 ) , and \u03b1i(X) = \u03a6\u22121 ( 1\u2212 \u00b5Ai (X) )\u221a 0.12 + 0.22, where \u03a6\u22121 denotes the quantile function of the standard normal distribution. Finally, we generate the outcomes via Y = A ( (\u00b5A1 (X)\u2212 1)\u00b5Y0 (X)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (X)\u00b5Y1 (X) + \u00b5Y1 (X) \u03b4A(X) ) (39) + (1\u2212A) ( \u00b5A1 (X)\u00b5 Y 0 (X)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (X)\u00b5Y1 (X) \u03b4A(X) ) + \u03b1UU + \u03f5Y , (40) where \u03f5Y \u223c N ( 0, 0.32 ) is noise and \u03b1U > 0 is a parameter indicating the level of unobserved confounding. This choice of A and Y in Eq. (38) and Eq. (39), respectively, implies that \u03c4(x) is indeed the ITE, i. e., it holds that \u03c4(x) = E[Y (1)\u2212 Y (0) | X = x]. Lemma 2. Let (X,Z,A, Y ) be sampled from the the previously described procedure. Then, it holds that \u00b5Ai (x) = E[A | Z = i,X = x] and \u00b5Yi (x) = E[Y | Z = i,X = x]. (41) Proof. The first claim follows from E[A | Z = i,X = x] = P (U + \u03f5A > \u03b1i(x)) = 1\u2212 \u03a6(\u03a6\u22121(1\u2212 \u00b5Ai (x))) = \u00b5Ai (x), (42) because U + \u03f5A \u223c N (0, \u221a 0.12 + 0.22). The second claim follows from E[Y | Z = i,X = x] = \u00b5Ai (x) ( (\u00b5A1 (x)\u2212 1)\u00b5Y0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x)\u00b5Y1 (x) + \u00b5Y1 (x) \u03b4A(x) ) (43) + (1\u2212 \u00b5Ai (x)) ( \u00b5A1 (x)\u00b5 Y 0 (x)\u2212 \u00b5A0 (x)\u00b5Y1 (x) \u03b4A(x) ) (44) = \u00b5Yi (x)\u03b4A(x) \u03b4A(x) = \u00b5Yi (x). (45) E OREGON HEALTH INSURANCE EXPERIMENT: The so-called Oregon health insurance experiment3 (OHIE) (Finkelstein et al., 2012) was an important RCT with non-compliance. It was intentionally conducted as large-scale effort among public health to assess the effect of health insurance on several outcomes such as health or economic status. In 2008, a lottery draw offered low-income, uninsured adults in Oregon participation in a Medicaid program, providing health insurance. Individuals whose names were drawn could decide to sign up for the program. In our analysis, the lottery assignment is the instrument Z, the decision to sign up for the Medicaid program is the treatment A, and an overall health score is the outcome Y . The outcome was obtained after a period of 12 months during in-person interviews. We use the following covariates X: age, gender, language, the number of emergency visits before the experiment, and the number of people the individual signed up with. The latter is used to control for peer effects, and it is important to include this variable in our analysis as it is the only variable influencing the propensity score (see below). We extract \u223c 10,000 observations from the OHIE data and plot the histograms of all variables in Fig. 7. We can clearly observe the presence of non-compliance within the data, because the ratio of treated / untreated individuals is much lower than the corresponding ratio for the treatment assignment. The data collection in the OHIE was done follows: After excluding individuals below the age of 19, above the age of 64, and individuals with residence outside of Oregon, 74,922 individuals were considered for the lottery. Among those, 29,834 were selected randomly and were offered participation in the program. However, the probability of selection depended on the number of household members on the waiting list: for instance, an individual who signed up with another person was twice as likely to be selected. From the 74,922 individuals, 57,528 signed up alone, 17,236 signed up with another person, and 158 signed up with two more people on the waiting list. Thus, the probability of being selected conditional on the number of household members on the waiting list follows the multivariate version of Wallenius\u2019 noncentral hypergeometric distribution (Chesson, 1976). Propensity score: We computed the propensity score as follows. To account for the Wallenius\u2019 noncentral hypergeometric distribution, we use the R package BiasedUrn to calculate the propensity score \u03c0(x) = P(Z = 1 | X = x). We obtained \u03c0(x) =  0.345, if individual x signed up alone, 0.571, if individual x signed up with one more person, 0.719, if individual x signed up with two more people. (46) 3Data available here: https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/oregon-health-insuranceexperiment During the training of both MRIV and DRIV, we use the calculated values from Eq. (46) for the propensity score. F DETAILS FOR BASELINE METHODS: In this section, we give a brief overview on the baselines which we used in our experiments. We implemented: (1) ITE methods for unconfoundedness: TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) and TARNet combined with the DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022); (2) general IV methods, i.e., IV methods developed for IV settings with multiple or continuous instruments and treatments: 2SLS (Wright, 1928), kernel IV (KIV) (Singh et al., 2019), DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a), DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017), DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019), DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019), and DMLIV combined with DRIV (as described in (Syrgkanis et al., 2019)); (3) the (plug-in) Wald estimator using linear models and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) (Chipman et al., 2010). Of note, the DR-learner assumes unconfoundedness, which is why we only combine it TARNet in our experiments. In the following, we provide details regarding methods and implementation. F.1 ITE METHODS FOR UNCONFOUNDEDNESS Many ITE methods assume unconfoundedness, i.e., that all confounders are observed in the data. Formally, the unconfoundedness assumption can be expressed in the potential outcomes framework as Y (1), Y (0) \u22a5\u22a5 A | X. (47) Under unconfoundedness, the ITE is identified as \u03c4(x) = \u00b51(x)\u2212 \u00b50(x) with \u00b5i(x) = E[Y | A = i,X = x]. (48) Methods that assume unconfoundedness proceed by estimating \u00b5i(x) = E[Y | A = i,X = x] from Eq. (48). However, if unobserved confounders U exist, it follows that \u03c4(x) = E[Y | A = 1, X = x, U ]\u2212 E[Y | A = 0, X = x, U ] \u0338= \u00b51(x)\u2212 \u00b50(x), (49) which means that estimators that assume unconfoundedness are generally biased. Nevertheless, we include two baselines that assume unconfoundedness into our experiments: TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) and the DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022). TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017): TARNet (Shalit et al., 2017) is a neural network that estimates the ITE components \u00b5i(x) from Eq. 48 by learning a shared representation \u03a6(x) and two potential outcome heads hi(\u03a6(x)). We train TARNet by minimizing the loss L(\u03b8) = n\u2211 i=1 L (hai(\u03a6(xi, \u03b8\u03a6), \u03b8hi), yi) , (50) where \u03b8 = (\u03b8h1 , \u03b8h0 , \u03b8\u03a6) denotes the model parameters and L denotes squared loss if Y is continuous or binary cross entropy loss if Y is binary. Note regarding balanced representations: In (Shalit et al., 2017), the authors propose to add an additional regularization term inspired from domain adaptation literature, which forces TARNet to learn a balanced representation \u03a6(x), i.e., that minimizes the distance the treatment and control group in the feature space. They showed that this approach leads to minimization of a generalization bound on the ITE estimation error if the representation is invertible. In our experiments, we refrained from learning balanced representations because minimizing the regularized loss from (Shalit et al., 2017) does not necessarily result in an invertible representation and thus may even harm the estimation performance. For a detailed discussion, we refer to (Curth & van der Schaar, 2021). Furthermore, by leaving out the regularization, we ensure comparability between the different baselines. If balanced representations are desired, the balanced representation approach could also be extended to MRIV-Net, as we also build MRIV-Net on learning shared representations. DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022): The DR-learner (Kennedy, 2022) is a meta learner that takes arbitrary estimators of the ITE componenets \u00b5i and the propensity score \u03c0(x) = P(A = 1 | X = x) as input and performs a pseudo outcome regression by using the pseudo outcome Y\u0302MR = ( A \u03c0\u0302(X) \u2212 1\u2212A 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(X) ) Y + ( 1\u2212 A \u03c0\u0302(X) ) \u00b5\u03021(X)\u2212 ( 1\u2212 1\u2212A 1\u2212 \u03c0\u0302(X) ) \u00b5\u03020(X). (51) In our experiments, we use TARNet as base method to provide initial estimators \u00b5\u0302i(X). We further learn propensity score estimates \u03c0\u0302(X) by adding a seperate representation to TARNet as done in (Shalit et al., 2017). F.2 GENERAL IV METHODS 2SLS (Wright, 1928): 2SLS (Wright, 1928) is a linear two-stage approach. First, the treatments A are regressed on the instruments Z and fitted values A\u0302 are obtained. In the second stage, the outcome Y is regressed on A\u0302. We implement 2SLS using the scikit-learn package. KIV (Singh et al., 2019): Kernel IV (Singh et al., 2019) generalizes 2SLS to nonlinear settings. KIV assumes that the data is generated by Y = f(A) + U, (52) where U is an additive unobserved confounder and f is some unknown (potentially nonlinear) structural function. KIV then models the structural function via f(a) = \u00b5t\u03c8(a) and E[\u03c8(A) | Z = z] = V \u03d5(z), (53) where \u03c8 and\u03d5 are feature maps. Here, kernel ridge regressions instead of linear regressions are used in both stages to estimate \u00b5 and V . Following (Singh et al., 2019) we use the exponential kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2008) and set the length scale to the median inter-point distance. KIV does not provide a direct way to incorporate the observed confounders X . Hence, we augment both the instrument and the treatment with X , which is consistent with previous work (Bennett et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021a). We also use two different samples for each stage as recommended in (Singh et al., 2019). DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a): DFIV (Xu et al., 2021a) is a similar approach KIV in generalizing 2SLS to nonlinear setting by assuming Eq. (52) and Eq. (53). However, instead of using kernel methods, DFIV models the features maps \u03c8\u03b8A and \u03d5\u03b8Z as neural networks with parameters \u03b8A and \u03b8Z , respectively. DFIV is trained by iteratively updating the parameters \u03b8A and \u03b8Z . The authors also provide a training algorithm that incorporates observed confounders X , which we implemented for our experiments. During training, we used two different datasets for each of the two stages as described in in the paper. DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017): DeepIV (Hartford et al., 2017) also assumes additive unobserved confounding as in Eq. (52), but leverages the identification result (Newey & Powell, 2003) E[Y | X = x, Z = z] = \u222b h(a, x) dF (a | x, z), (54) where h(a, x) = f(a, x) + E[U | X = x] is the target counterfactual prediction function. DeepIV estimates F (a | x, z), i.e., the conditional distribution function of the treatment A given observed covariates X and instruments Z, by using neural networks. Because we consider only binary treatments, we simply implement a (tunable) feed-forward neural network with sigmoid activation function. Then, DeepIV proceeds by learning a second stage neural network to solve the inverse problem defined by Eq. (54). DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019): DeepGMM (Bennett et al., 2019) adopts neural networks for IV estimation inspired by the (optimally weighted) Generalized Method of Moments. The DeepGMM estimator is defined as the solution of the following minimax game: \u03b8\u0302 \u2208 argmin \u03b8\u2208\u0398 sup \u03c4\u2208T 1 n n\u2211 i=1 f(zi, \u03c4)(yi \u2212 g(ai, \u03b8))\u2212 1 4n n\u2211 i=1 f2(zi, \u03c4)(yi \u2212 g(ai, \u03b8\u0303))2, (55) where f(zi, \u00b7) and g(ai, \u00b7) are parameterized by neural networks. As recommended in (Bennett et al., 2019), we solve this optimization via adversarial training with the Optimistic Adam optimizer (Daskalakis et al., 2018), where we set the parameter \u03b8\u0303 to the previous value of \u03b8. DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019): DMLIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) assumes that the data is generated via Y = \u03c4(X)A+ f(X) + U, (56) where \u03c4 is the ITE f some function of the observed covariates. First, DMLIV estimates the functions q(X) = E[Y | X], h(Z,X) = E[A | Z,X], and p(X) = E[A | X]. Then, the ITE is learned by minimizing the loss L(\u03b8) = \u2211 i=1 (yi \u2212 q\u0302(xi)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302(xi, \u03b8)(h\u0302(zi, xi)\u2212 p\u0302(xi))2, (57) where \u03c4\u0302(X, \u00b7) is some model for \u03c4(X). In our experiments, we use (tunable) feed-forward neural networks for all estimators. DRIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019): DRIV (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) is a meta learner, originally proposed in combination with DMLIV. It requires initial estimators for q(X), p(X), \u03c0(X) = E[Z | X = x], and f(X) = E[A \u00b7Z | X = x] as well as an initial ITE estimatior \u03c4\u0302init(X) (e.g., from DMLIV). The ITE is then estimated by a pseudo regression on the following doubly robust pseudo outcome: Y\u0302DR = \u03c4\u0302init(X) + (Y \u2212 q\u0302(X)\u2212 \u03c4\u0302init(X)(A\u2212 p\u0302(X))Z \u2212 \u03c0\u0302(X)) f\u0302(X)\u2212 p\u0302(X)r\u0302(X) . (58) We implement all regressions using (tunable) feed-forward neural networks. Comparison between DRIV vs. MRIV: There are two key differences between our paper and (Syrgkanis et al., 2019): (i) In contrast to DRIV, we showed that our MRIV is multiply robust. (ii) We derive a multiple robust convergence rate, while the rate in (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) is not robust with respect to the nuisance rates. Ad (i): Both MRIV and DRIV perform a pseudo-outcome regression on the efficient influence function (EIF) of the ATE. The key difference: DRIV uses the doubly robust parametrization of the EIF from (Okui et al., 2012), whereas we use the multiply robust parametrization of the EIF from (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018)4. Hence, our MRIV frameworks extends DRIV in a non-trivial way to achieve multiple robustness. Thus, our estimator is consistent in the union of three different model specifications.5 Ad (ii): Here, we compare the convergence rates from DRIV and our MRIV and, thereby, show the strengths of our MRIV. To this end, let us assume that the pseudo regression function is \u03b3-smooth and that we use the same second-stage estimator E\u0302n with minimax rate n\u2212 2\u03b3 2\u03b3+p for both DRIV and MRIV. If the nuisance parameters q(X), p(X), f(X), and \u03c0(X) are \u03b1-smooth and further are estimated with minimax rate n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p , Corollary 4 from (Syrgkanis et al., 2019) states that DRIV converges with rate E [ (\u03c4\u0302DRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b3 2\u03b3+p + n \u22124\u03b1 2\u03b1+p . In contrast, MRIV assumes estimation of the nuisance parameters \u00b5Y0 (x) with rate n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p , \u00b5A0 (x) and \u03b4A(x) with rate n \u22122\u03b2 2\u03b2+p , and \u03c0(x) with rate n \u22122\u03b4 2\u03b4+p . If the initial estimator \u03c4\u0302init(x) converges with rate r\u03c4 (n), our Theorem 2 yields the rate E [ (\u03c4\u0302MRIV(x)\u2212 \u03c4(x))2 ] \u2272 n \u22122\u03b3 2\u03b3+p + r\u03c4 (n) ( n \u22122\u03b2 2\u03b2+p + n \u22122\u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b1 2\u03b1+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ) + n\u22122( \u03b2 2\u03b2+p+ \u03b4 2\u03b4+p ). If all nuisance parameters converge with the same minimax rate of n \u22122\u03b1 2\u03b1+p , the rates of DRIV and our MRIV coincide. However, different to DRIV, our rate is additionally multiple robust in spirit of Theorem 1. This presents a crucial strength of our MRIV over DRIV: For example, if \u03b4 is small (slow convergence of \u03c0\u0302(x)), our MRIV still with fast rate as long as \u03b1 and \u03b2 are large (i.e., if the other nuisance parameters are sufficiently smooth). F.3 WALD ESTIMATOR Finally, we consider the Wald estimator (Wald, 1940) for the binary IV setting. More precisely, we estimate the ITE components \u00b5Yi (x) and \u00b5 A i (x) seperately and plug them into \u03c4(x) = \u00b5\u0302Y1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x) \u00b5\u0302A1 (x)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) . (59) We consider two versions of the Wald estimator: 4For a detailed discussion on multiple robustness and the importance of the EIF parametrization, we refer to (Wang & Blei, 2019), Section 4.5. 5On a related note, a similar, important contribution of developing multiply robust method was recently made for the average treatment effect. Here, the estimator of (Okui et al., 2012) was extended by the estimator of (Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2018) to allow for multi robustness. Yet, this different from our work in that it focuses on the average treatment effect, while we study the individual treatment effect in our paper. Linear: We use linear regressions to estimate the \u00b5Yi (x) and logistic regressions to estimate the \u00b5Ai (x). BART: We use Bayesian additive regression trees (Chipman et al., 2010) trees to estimate the \u00b5Yi (x) and random forest classifier to estimate the \u00b5Ai (x). G VISUALIZATION OF PREDICTED ITES We plot the predicted ITEs for the different baselines and MRIV-Net in Fig. 8 (for n = 3000). As expected, the linear methods (2SLS and linear Wald) are not flexible enough to provide accurate ITE estimates. We also observe that the curve of MRIV-Net without MRIV is quite wiggly, i.e., the estimator has a relatively large variance. This variance is reduced when the full MRIV-Net is applied. As a result, curve is much smoother. This is reasonable because MRIV does not estimate the ITE components individually, but estimates the ITE directly via the Stage 2 pseudo outcome regression. Overall, this confirms the superiority of our proposed framework. H IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND HYPERPARAMETER TUNING Implementation details for deep learning models: To make the performance of the deep learning models comparable, we implemented all feed-forward neural networks (including MRIV-Net) as follows: We use two hidden layers with RELU activation functions. We also incorporated a dropout layer for each hidden layer. We trained all models with the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) using 100 epochs. Exceptions are only DFIV and DeepGMM, where we used 200 epochs for training, accounting for slower convergence of the respective (adversarial) training algorithms. For DeepGMM, we further used Optimistic Adam (Daskalakis et al., 2018) as in the original paper. Training times: We report the approximate times needed to train the deep learning models on our simulated data with n = 5000 in Table 5. For training, we used an AMD Ryzen Pro 7 CPU. Compared to DMLIV and DRIV, the training of MRIV-Net is faster because only a single neural network is trained. Hyperparameter tuning: We performed hyperparameter tuning for all deep learning models (including MRIV-Net), KIV, and the BART Wald estimator on all datasets. For all methods except KIV and DFIV, we split the data into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). We then performed 40 random grid search iterations and chose the set of parameters that minimized the respective training loss on the validation set. In particular, the tuning procedure was the same for all baselines, which ensures that the performance gain of MRIV-Net is due to the method itself and not due to larger flexibility. Exceptions are only KIV and DFIV, for which we implemented the customized hyperparameter tuning algorithms proposed in (Singh et al., 2019) and (Xu et al., 2021a) to ensure consistency with prior literature. For the meta learners (DR-learner, DRIV, and MRIV), we first performed hyperparameter tuning for the base methods and nuisance models, before tuning the pseudo outcome regression neural network by using the input from the tuned models. The tuning ranges for the hyperparameter are shown in Table 6. These include both the hyperparameter rangers shared across all neural networks and the model-specific hyperparameters. For reproducibility purposes, we publish the selected hyperparameters in our GitHub project as .yaml files.6 Hyperparameter robustness checks: We also investigate the robustness of MRIV-Net with respect to hyperparameter choice. To to this, we fix the optimal hyperparameter constellation for our simulated data for n = 3000 and perturb the hidden layer sizes, learning rate, dropout probability, and batch size. The results are shown in Fig. 9. We observe that the RMSE only changes marginally when perturbing 6Codes are in the supplementary materials. the different hyperparameters, indicating that our method is to a certain degree robust against hyperparameter misspecification. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance improvement of MRIV-Net over the baselines observed in our experiments is not due to hyperparameter tuning, but to our method itself. I RESULTS FOR SEMI-SYNTHETIC DATA: In the main paper, we evaluated MRIV-Net both on synthetic and real-world data. Here, we provide additional results by constructing a semi-synthetic dataset on the basis of OHIE. It is common practice in causal inference literature to use semi-synthetic data for evaluation, because it combines advantages of both synthetic and real-world data. On the one hand, the real-world data part ensures that the data distribution is realistic and matches those in practice. On the other hand, the counterfactual ground-truth is still available, which makes it possible to measure the performance of ITE methods. We construct our semi-synthetic data as follows: First, we extract the covariates X \u2208 R5 and instruments Z \u2208 {0, 1} of our OHIE dataset from Sec. E. Then, we construct the treatment components \u00b5Ai (x) via \u00b5A1 (X) = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3(X1) + 0.7 and \u00b5A0 (X) = 0.3 \u00b7 \u03c3(X1), (60) where X1 is the (standardized) age and \u03c3(\u00b7) is the sigmoid function. The outcome components are constructed via \u00b5Y1 (X) = 0.5X 2 1 + 5\u2211 i=2 X2i and \u00b5 Y 0 (X) = \u22120.5X21 + 5\u2211 i=2 X2i . (61) We then sample treatments A and outcomes Y as in Eq. (38) and Eq. (39). Lemma 2 ensures that \u00b5Yi (X) = E[Y | Z = i,X] and \u00b5Ai (X) = E[A | Z = i,X]. Given the above, the oracle ITE becomes \u03c4(X) = X21 0.7 . (62) Note that \u03c4(X) is sparse in the sense that it only depends on age, while the outcome components depend on all five covariates. Following our theoretical analysis in Sec. C, MRIV-Net should thus outperform methods that aim at estimating the components directly. This is confirmed in Table 7, where we show the results for all baselines and MRIV-Net on the semi-synthetic data. Indeed, we observe that MRIV-Net outperforms all other baselines, confirming both the superiority of our method as well as our theoretical results under sparsity assumptions from Sec. C. J RESULTS FOR CROSS-FITTING: Here, we repeat our experiments from the main paper but now make use of cross-fitting. Recall that, in Theorem 2, we assume that the nuisance parameter estimation and the pseudo-outcome regression are performed on three independent samples. We now address this through cross-fitting. To this end, our aim is to show that our proposed MRIV framework is again superior. For MRIV, we proceeded as follows: We split the sample D into three equally sized samples D1, D2, and D3. We then trained \u03c4\u0302init(x), \u00b5\u0302Y0 (x), and \u00b5\u0302A0 (x) on D1, \u03b4\u0302A(x) and \u03c0\u0302(x) on D2, and performed the pseudo-outcome regression on D3. Then, we repeated the same training procedure two times, but performed the pseudo-outcome regression on D2 and D1. Finally, we averaged the resulting three ITE estimators. For DRIV, we implemented the cross-fitting procedure described in (Syrgkanis et al., 2019). For the DR-learner, we followed (Kennedy, 2022). The results are in Table 8. Importantly, the results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed MRIV. Overall, we find that our proposed MRIV outperforms DRIV for the vast majority of base methods when performing cross-fitting. Furthermore, MRIV-Net is highly competitive even when comparing it with the cross-fitted estimators. This shows that our heuristic to learn separate representations instead of performing sample splits works in practice. In sum, the results confirm empirically that our MRIV is superior."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paper \"Estimating individual treatment effects under unobserved confounding using binary instruments\" by Frauen and Feuerriegel (2022) appears to be closely related, as indicated by both Arxiv and Semantic Scholar results.

A rigorous assessment requires delving into its theoretical underpinnings, the specifics of its robustness claims, the validity of its assumptions, and the correctness of its convergence rate analysis.\\n\\nGiven that the \\\"MRIV framework\\\" is a proposed concept without a specific paper or implementation to reference, this assessment will be based on the general principles of doubly/multiply robust estimation and Instrumental Variables, assuming the framework follows standard practices in the econometrics and causal inference literature for achieving such properties (e.g., via augmented inverse probability weighting, targeted maximum likelihood, or moment condition augmentation).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Detailed Assessment of the MRIV Framework**\\n\\n#### **I. Theoretical Soundness**\\n\\n1.  **Identifiability of the Causal Estimand:**\\n    *   **Strength:** The foundation of any IV method is the identification of the causal parameter. If the MRIV framework aims to estimate standard IV estimands (e.g., the Wald estimator for a constant treatment effect, or a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)), the theoretical soundness relies on the *standard IV assumptions* (relevance, exclusion restriction, monotonicity for LATE, independence of instrument and potential outcomes/treatments conditional on covariates).\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The framework must clearly define the estimand it targets (e.g., ATE, LATE, or a structural parameter in a linear/nonlinear model). The chosen identifying assumptions must be clearly stated and justified. The \\\"multiple robustness\\\" property primarily addresses the functional form specification of *nuisance functions*, not the fundamental untestable IV assumptions themselves. The method should correctly derive the moment conditions or score functions that, when expectation is taken, yield the desired causal parameter.\\n\\n2.  **Construction of Robust Estimating Equations/Score Functions:**\\n    *   **Strength:** The core idea of multiple robustness is to construct an estimating equation (or a score function) for the causal parameter such that it remains valid (i.e., its expectation is zero at the true parameter value) even if some parts of the model (nuisance functions) are misspecified, provided *at least one* specified path is correct. This is typically achieved through \\\"orthogonalization\\\" or \\\"augmentation.\\\"\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The mathematical derivation of these robust moment conditions is critical. It must be shown that the bias terms arising from misspecification of one set of nuisance functions precisely cancel out if another set is correctly specified. This often involves intricate algebraic manipulation of the influence function. A common approach involves models for:\\n        *   Outcome regression (e.g., $E[Y|D,X]$)\\n        *   First-stage regression (e.g., $E[D|Z,X]$)\\n        *   Reduced-form regression (e.g., $E[Y|Z,X]$)\\n        *   Propensity score for treatment (e.g., $P(D=1|Z,X)$)\\n        *   Potentially, conditional expectations of Y or D given just X ($E[Y|X]$, $E[D|X]$).\\n    *   The \\\"multiple\\\" aspect implies consistency under more than two correct specifications, which is much harder to achieve than standard double robustness and requires very specific structures or additional assumptions. The framework needs to explicitly state *which specific combinations* of correct models guarantee consistency.\\n\\n3.  **Semi-parametric Efficiency (Potential):**\\n    *   **Strength:** Well-designed doubly robust estimators are often semi-parametrically efficient when *all* nuisance functions are correctly specified. This means they achieve the lowest possible asymptotic variance among all regular, asymptotically linear estimators in the given semi-parametric model.\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The MRIV framework should prove whether it attains this efficiency bound. If it does, this is a significant theoretical advantage. If not, the trade-off between robustness and efficiency needs to be discussed.\\n\\n#### **II. Multiple Robustness Claims**\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Specificity:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The term \\\"multiple robustness\\\" can sometimes be used loosely. It is crucial for the framework to define precisely what \\\"multiple\\\" means:\\n        *   Is it merely \\\"doubly robust\\\" with respect to two main sets of nuisance functions (e.g., outcome model vs. treatment assignment model), where each set might itself contain multiple components (e.g., $E[Y|D,X]$ and $E[D|Z,X]$ in one set, vs. $E[Y|Z,X]$ and $E[D|X]$ in another)? This is common for DR-IV estimators.\\n        *   Or does it imply consistency if *any* of $k$ distinct models are correct, even if $k-1$ are misspecified? This level of true \\\"k-fold\\\" robustness is exceedingly difficult to achieve in practice, especially for IV, and typically requires very strong assumptions or specific model structures.\\n    *   The paper must present explicit theorems for each path to consistency: \\\"If nuisance models A are correctly specified, the estimator is consistent. If nuisance models B are correctly specified, the estimator is consistent.\\\" And if there are more paths, each must be clearly delineated.\\n\\n2.  **Mechanism for Multiple Robustness:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The paper must show *how* the multiple robustness is achieved. This usually involves defining a set of moment conditions where, under different correct specifications, the problematic terms (those arising from misspecified nuisance functions) cancel out. For instance, in an AIPW-type estimator, specific terms might vanish due to zero means or conditional expectations. The mathematical proofs for these cancellations are paramount.\\n\\n#### **III. Validity of Assumptions**\\n\\n1.  **Standard IV Assumptions (Fundamental and Untestable):**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The MRIV framework *does not* relax the core identifying IV assumptions. These remain critical:\\n        *   **Relevance:** The instrument $Z$ must have a non-zero causal effect on the endogenous treatment $D$, conditional on covariates $X$ ($Cov(Z,D|X) \\\\ne 0$). This is often testable.\\n        *   **Exclusion Restriction:** The instrument $Z$ must affect the outcome $Y$ *only* through its effect on $D$, conditional on $X$. This is typically the most contentious and untestable assumption.\\n        *   **Independence/Exogeneity:** The instrument $Z$ must be independent of the potential outcomes and potential treatments (or unobserved confounders) conditional on $X$.\\n        *   **Monotonicity (for LATE):** If targeting LATE, the instrument must affect all individuals in the same direction (no defiers).\\n    *   The MRIV framework offers robustness to *functional form assumptions for nuisance parameters*, not to these fundamental IV assumptions. This distinction must be made crystal clear. If the core IV assumptions fail, the MRIV estimator will be biased, regardless of its robustness to nuisance function misspecification.\\n\\n2.  **Nuisance Function Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Correct Specification (of at least one set):** This is the central assumption enabling robustness. The framework must clearly state the *types* of nuisance functions (e.g., conditional means, conditional probabilities) and their properties (e.g., smooth, well-behaved).\\n    *   **Common Support:** For methods relying on propensity scores or inverse probability weighting, common support (i.e., $0 < P(D=d|Z,X) < 1$ and $0 < P(Z=z|X) < 1$) is often required. This is a practical concern, especially in high dimensions.\\n    *   **Regularity Conditions:** Standard statistical regularity conditions (e.g., finite moments, differentiability, non-singular matrices) are typically assumed for consistency and asymptotic normality.\\n\\n3.  **Assumptions on Estimation of Nuisance Functions:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** If nuisance functions are estimated using non-parametric or machine learning methods (as is common with DR estimators), the assumptions on their convergence rates are crucial. For standard doubly robust estimators, if the product of the errors in estimating the two nuisance functions converges at a rate faster than $n^{-1/2}$ (e.g., if each converges at $n^{-1/4}$), the main parameter can still be root-n consistent.\\n    *   For *multiple* robustness (more than two paths), the requirements for nuisance function estimation can become even more stringent (e.g., faster rates for each individual nuisance function, or specific conditions on how products of multiple errors behave) to maintain root-n consistency of the causal parameter. The framework must detail these requirements and show that the chosen estimation methods (e.g., specific ML algorithms) satisfy them.\\n\\n#### **IV. Correctness of Convergence Rate Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Root-n Consistency:**\\n    *   **Strength:** The goal for any estimand in econometrics is typically $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, allowing for standard inference. The MRIV framework must rigorously prove that the causal parameter estimate is $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistent under the specified robustness conditions.\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** This proof involves showing that the score function, evaluated at the true parameter and estimated nuisance functions, has an asymptotically linear representation. The key is to demonstrate that the remainder terms involving errors from nuisance function estimation are of a sufficiently small order, typically $o_p(n^{-1/2})$.\\n\\n2.  **Influence Function and Asymptotic Normality:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The derivation of the influence function is essential for establishing asymptotic normality and constructing standard errors. The influence function will reveal how estimation errors in the nuisance functions affect the main parameter. For multiple robustness, the influence function needs to reflect the orthogonality/cancellation properties.\\n\\n3.  **Impact of Non-Parametric Nuisance Estimation:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** If non-parametric or high-dimensional nuisance function estimation is employed, the rate analysis becomes more complex. The framework must correctly invoke relevant theorems (e.g., from Newey, Robins, Chernozhukov, et al.) that govern the behavior of such estimators when used as inputs for a main parameter. The \\\"rate conditions\\\" for nuisance function estimation (e.g., $n^{1/4}$ or faster for each, or a combined error product rate) must be clearly stated and justified. A common pitfall is to assume the plug-in estimator behaves as if the nuisance functions were known, which is only true under specific orthogonality conditions and sufficiently fast rates.\\n\\n4.  **Optimality Claims:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** If the framework claims \\\"optimality\\\" (e.g., semi-parametric efficiency), it must formally show that its asymptotic variance attains the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the given model, under the condition that *all* nuisance functions are correctly specified. This often involves deriving the efficient score function and showing that the proposed estimator's influence function matches it.\\n\\n### **Potential Flaws or Inconsistencies in the Methodology (General Points to Look For)**\\n\\n1.  **Vague \\\"Multiple Robustness\\\" Claims:** If the specific paths to consistency are not precisely defined or proven, the robustness claim is weak.\\n2.  **Overlooking Fundamental IV Assumption Vulnerabilities:** If the framework implies that it mitigates the untestable nature of the exclusion restriction, it's a critical misrepresentation. Its robustness is about *functional forms*, not unobserved confounding.\\n3.  **Unrealistic Nuisance Function Rate Requirements:** If the framework claims root-n consistency with non-parametric nuisance estimation but requires rates (e.g., $n^{1/2}$) that are unachievable for typical non-parametric methods, it's a fatal flaw.\\n4.  **Curse of Dimensionality:** If many nuisance functions need to be estimated non-parametrically in high-dimensional covariate spaces, the finite-sample performance might be poor, even if asymptotic theory holds. The framework should acknowledge practical limitations.\\n5.  **Computational Complexity:** Estimating multiple, potentially non-linear, nuisance functions and solving complex augmented moment conditions can be computationally intensive and numerically unstable.\\n6.  **Lack of Empirical Guidance:** A theoretically sound framework also needs practical guidance on how to choose and estimate the nuisance functions (e.g., parametric, non-parametric, specific ML algorithms) and how to diagnose when one path might be better than another.\\n7.  **Finite Sample Performance:** While asymptotic properties are key, strong finite sample performance is also desirable. Sometimes, highly robust estimators can have larger finite-sample variance if the models are only slightly misspecified.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weighted Recommendation**\\n\\n**Weighted Recommendation: Conditional Accept (with Strong Reservations if Claims are Overstated)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe conceptual goal of an MRIV framework\u2014to combine the strengths of IV with the resilience of multiple robustness\u2014is theoretically appealing and highly valuable. Model misspecification is a pervasive problem, and reducing reliance on a single, potentially incorrect, functional form assumption is a significant advancement. Prior work on doubly robust IV (e.g., Chernozhukov et al. (2016), Rothe and Firpo (2018)) demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of such approaches.\\n\\nHowever, the \\\"multiple\\\" in MRIV introduces a higher level of complexity and scrutiny. The acceptance hinges entirely on the **rigor and precision** with which the framework addresses the following:\\n\\n*   **Clarity on \\\"Multiple\\\" Robustness:** Is it genuinely more than two distinct paths to consistency, or is it a doubly robust estimator with multiple *components* within each of the two paths? The latter is more common and achievable. The specific conditions for each path must be laid out with formal proofs of cancellation.\\n*   **Proof of Rate Preservation:** The most challenging aspect for any non-parametrically estimated DR/MR estimator is proving that the estimation errors of the nuisance functions do not degrade the $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistency of the causal parameter. If non-parametric/ML methods are used for nuisance functions, the paper must provide rigorous proofs that the required rate conditions are met (e.g., $n^{1/4}$ for each nuisance function or appropriate product of errors rates) and that the causal parameter's influence function is truly orthogonal to the nuisance function scores.\\n*   **Addressing Fundamental IV Assumptions:** The framework must clearly state that its robustness is *conditional* on the standard, untestable IV assumptions (relevance, exclusion, exogeneity, monotonicity) holding. It offers no magic bullet against violations of these core assumptions.\\n*   **Practical Feasibility and Computational Considerations:** While asymptotic results are important, the framework should also discuss the practical implications, such as the curse of dimensionality for non-parametric nuisance estimation in high-dimensional covariate spaces, and the computational challenges.\\n\\nIf the framework presents detailed, rigorous mathematical proofs for its multiple robustness claims, precisely defines the conditions under which consistency and asymptotic normality hold (especially with estimated nuisance functions), and acknowledges the limitations with respect to core IV assumptions, it would be a significant contribution. Without such rigor, particularly regarding the \\\"multiple\\\" robustness and convergence rates, the claims would likely be considered unproven or overstated, warranting a stronger rejection.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9998.9372577\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed assessment of the theoretical soundness of the MRIV framework, focusing on the multiple robustness claims, the validity of the assumptions, and the correctness of the convergence rate analysis.

Relevance and Applicability of the Instrumental Variable Assumptions**\\n\\nThis is the bedrock of any credible IV analysis. The paper must clearly state, justify, and ideally test (where possible) the core IV assumptions.\\n\\n*   **Relevance (First Stage):**\\n    *   **What it means:** The instrument (Z) must be sufficiently correlated with the treatment (D), conditional on covariates.\\n    *   **How to assess:** The paper should present a strong and statistically significant first-stage regression.

The paper should discuss this if applicable and consider alternative methods or acknowledge limitations.\\n    *   **Applicability:** Is the instrument *practically* relevant in influencing the treatment?

It should not have a direct effect on Y, nor should it affect Y through any other unobserved pathway.\\n    *   **How to assess:** This assumption is generally *untestable* and relies heavily on strong theoretical justification and domain expertise.\\n    *   **Crucial Evaluation Points:**\\n        *   Does the paper provide a compelling narrative or logical argument for why Z would not directly influence Y or do so via other pathways?\\n        *   Does it consider plausible alternative mechanisms (e.g., Z affecting Y through an omitted confounder or another variable that is not D)?\\n        *   Does it present falsification tests or placebo tests to bolster confidence (e.g., showing Z doesn't affect pre-treatment outcomes or outcomes for a control group not subject to D)?\\n        *   Does it control for all relevant observed covariates that might be common causes of Z and Y, or Z and D?\\n\\n*   **Independence (Unconfoundedness of the Instrument):**\\n    *   **What it means:** The instrument (Z) must be as good as randomly assigned, or exogenous with respect to unobserved confounders that affect both the treatment (D) and the outcome (Y).\\n    *   **How to assess:** Similar to the exclusion restriction, this is largely untestable. It relies on the strength of the research design.\\n    *   **Crucial Evaluation Points:**\\n        *   Is the instrument truly \\\"as-if\\\" randomly assigned (e.g., lottery, natural experiment, policy cutoff)?\\n        *   Does the paper account for all observed confounders that might influence Z, D, and Y?\\n        *   Does it discuss potential unobserved confounders that might correlate with Z and independently influence D and/or Y? For example, if the instrument is a policy change, are there other contemporaneous changes that could also affect the outcome?\\n\\n*   **Monotonicity (No Defiers):**\\n    *   **What it means:** For the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) interpretation, there are no \\\"defiers\\\"\u2014individuals who would take the treatment if not encouraged, but not take it if encouraged. All individuals must respond to the instrument in the same direction (e.g., an encouragement to treat only encourages treatment, it doesn't cause anyone to *stop* treatment).\\n    *   **How to assess:** This is often plausible in many policy contexts (e.g., encouragement to vaccinate only increases vaccination rates, it doesn't decrease them). It can be violated in two-sided non-compliance scenarios.\\n    *   **Applicability:** Does the paper acknowledge that IV estimates, under these assumptions, typically identify the LATE for the \\\"compliers\\\" (those whose treatment status is influenced by the instrument), rather than the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for the entire population? Is this LATE relevant to the research question?\\n\\n#### **2. Handling of Unobserved Confounding**\\n\\nThe primary motivation for using IV is to address unobserved confounding.\\n\\n*   **Addressing Unobserved Confounding:**\\n    *   Does the paper clearly articulate *which* specific unobserved confounders it aims to address through the IV strategy?\\n    *   Does it present evidence (e.g., a comparison of OLS estimates to IV estimates) that suggests unobserved confounding is indeed biasing the non-IV estimates? A significant difference between OLS and IV, with plausible directions of bias, strengthens the argument for the need for IV.\\n    *   Does it discuss any *remaining* unobserved confounding that the IV strategy might *not* address (e.g., if the instrument itself is confounded in a way that violates the independence assumption)?\\n    *   Does it perform sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the results to slight violations of the IV assumptions (e.g., if there's a small direct effect of Z on Y, or if Z is slightly confounded)?\\n\\n#### **3. Connection to Existing Causal Inference Literature**\\n\\nA strong paper grounds itself within the established body of causal inference knowledge.\\n\\n*   **Contextualization:** Does the paper correctly situate its IV application within the broader causal inference literature (e.g., Angrist & Pischke, Imbens, Wooldridge)? Does it acknowledge the LATE interpretation?\\n*   **Methodological Rigor:** Does it employ standard and appropriate IV estimation techniques (e.g., Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), GMM, limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) for weak IVs)? Does it correctly calculate standard errors (e.g., robust, clustered)?\\n*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Does it discuss why IV is the *most appropriate* method compared to other causal inference strategies (e.g., Regression Discontinuity, Difference-in-Differences, Matching, RCT) for the specific research question and data available? Is there a discussion of the trade-offs?\\n*   **Novelty/Contribution:** Does the paper propose a novel instrument, apply IV in a new context, or extend existing IV methodology? If so, does it clearly articulate this contribution?\\n\\n#### **4. Practical Significance and Potential Impact on Real-World Applications**\\n\\nBeyond methodological soundness, the work's real-world utility is crucial.\\n\\n*   **Policy Relevance:** Does the research question address a significant policy issue or a practically important decision?\\n*   **Magnitude and Interpretability of Effects:** Are the estimated causal effects substantively meaningful? Are they presented in a way that is easily interpretable for policymakers or practitioners (e.g., \\\"a 1% increase in X leads to a Y unit change in Z\\\")?\\n*   **Generalizability:** Given that IV often identifies a LATE, how generalizable are the findings to other populations or contexts? Does the paper discuss the external validity of its findings?\\n*   **Limitations and Recommendations:** Does the paper transparently discuss the limitations of its findings, particularly concerning the IV assumptions and the LATE interpretation? Does it offer actionable recommendations based on its findings, while also acknowledging the scope of applicability?\\n*   **Cost-Benefit Implications:** If the treatment involves policy intervention, does the paper provide any insight into the potential cost-effectiveness or feasibility of implementing interventions based on the findings?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weighted Recommendation and Justification**\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept with Moderate Revisions**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nMy recommendation is \\\"Accept with Moderate Revisions\\\" for a hypothetical paper utilizing instrumental variables. This reflects the inherent difficulty in satisfying all IV assumptions perfectly and the typical need for rigorous defense and robustness checks.\\n\\n*   **Strengths (Assuming a well-executed paper):**\\n    *   **Addresses a Fundamental Challenge:** The paper rightly attempts to tackle unobserved confounding, a critical issue in empirical research, by employing IV. This immediately places it within the realm of high-impact causal inference.\\n    *   **Methodological Sophistication:** The use of IV demonstrates an understanding of advanced econometric techniques necessary for robust causal claims.\\n    *   **Potential for High Impact:** If the IV strategy is credible, the findings could provide highly valuable, less-biased estimates of a causal effect, which could directly inform policy or practice.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Potential Revisions/Closer Scrutiny (Common Challenges in IV Papers):**\\n    *   **Rigorous Defense of IV Assumptions:** This is the most crucial area. Even if the paper clearly states the assumptions, the *justification* for the exclusion restriction and instrument exogeneity is often the weakest link. Reviewers will demand exceptionally strong, detailed arguments, supported by theory, institutional knowledge, and falsification tests. The paper *must* go beyond merely stating \\\"we believe the assumptions hold\\\" and provide compelling evidence or arguments.\\n    *   **Transparent Discussion of LATE:** While implied by IV, the paper needs to explicitly discuss the LATE interpretation, the characteristics of the complier population, and the implications for generalizability.\\n    *   **Robustness Checks:** A strong paper will include a comprehensive set of robustness checks, such as sensitivity analyses to potential violations of assumptions, alternative instrument specifications, and different sample definitions. This is often the area where papers can be significantly strengthened.\\n    *   **Comparison to Alternatives:** While IV is chosen for a reason, a brief discussion of why other methods (if applicable) were ruled out or how IV complements them would enhance the paper's contribution.\\n    *   **Clarity of Interpretation:** Ensuring that the practical significance and policy implications are clearly articulated, without overstating the generalizability given the LATE, is key.\\n\\nIn essence, an IV paper is a high-reward, high-risk endeavor. The \\\"Accept with Moderate Revisions\\\" recommendation implies that the core idea, research question, and initial application of IV are sound, but the devil is in the details of defending its assumptions and rigorously testing the robustness of the results.

Is the chosen deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and specific libraries mentioned?\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **Lack of Justification:** Design choices appear arbitrary without clear rationale or ablation studies supporting their necessity.\\n*   **Over-complexity:** The architecture might be unnecessarily complex, making it difficult to understand, debug, or generalize.\\n*   **Resource Intensive:** The model might be too large or slow for practical clinical deployment without high-end hardware.\\n*   **Lack of Open-source Implementation:** No publicly available code or clear instructions for replication.\\n\\n#### 2. Experimental Setup\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Dataset Quality and Diversity:**\\n    *   **Size:** Sufficiently large and diverse datasets (multiple centers, scanners, patient populations) to ensure generalizability.\\n    *   **Pre-processing:** Clearly described pre-processing steps (e.g., normalization, registration, bias correction, skull stripping).\\n    *   **Annotation:** Detailed explanation of how ground truth annotations were obtained (e.g., expert radiologists, consensus agreement) and their quality.\\n    *   **Data Splits:** Standard and transparent splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring no data leakage (e.g., patient-level splits rather than image-level splits for longitudinal data). Cross-validation or leave-one-out approaches for smaller datasets.\\n*   **Metrics:**\\n    *   **Appropriate Metrics:** Use of standard, widely accepted metrics relevant to the specific task (e.g., Dice Score, IoU, Hausdorff Distance for segmentation; Accuracy, F1-score, AUC for classification; MAE, RMSE for regression).\\n    *   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Reporting multiple metrics to provide a holistic view of performance, including those sensitive to small structures or boundary errors.\\n*   **Training Protocol:**\\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** All hyperparameters (learning rate schedule, batch size, optimizer, loss function, epochs, regularization, data augmentation strategy) are clearly listed.\\n    *   **Loss Function:** Justification for the chosen loss function (e.g., Dice loss for imbalance, cross-entropy, hybrid losses).\\n    *   **Augmentation:** Details on data augmentation strategies, which are crucial for medical imaging due to limited data.\\n    *   **Computational Resources:** Specification of GPU/CPU type, memory, and training time.\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **Small/Homogeneous Dataset:** Limited generalizability due to a small, single-center, or highly homogeneous dataset.\\n*   **Unclear Pre-processing:** Ambiguous or missing details on data preparation.\\n*   **Inappropriate Metrics:** Using metrics that don't capture the true clinical utility or are insensitive to critical errors.\\n*   **Insufficient Details:** Missing crucial hyperparameters, making replication impossible.\\n*   **Data Leakage:** Incorrect data splitting that artificially inflates performance.\\n\\n#### 3. Comparison to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Baselines\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Relevant Baselines:** Comparison against a diverse set of strong, recent, and widely-cited SOTA methods that are either specifically designed for the same task or are general-purpose architectures commonly adapted for it.

A rigorous assessment requires delving into its theoretical underpinnings, the specifics of its robustness claims, the validity of its assumptions, and the correctness of its convergence rate analysis.\\n\\nGiven that the \"MRIV framework\" is a proposed concept without a specific paper or implementation to reference, this assessment will be based on the general principles of doubly/multiply robust estimation and Instrumental Variables, assuming the framework follows standard practices in the econometrics and causal inference literature for achieving such properties (e.g., via augmented inverse probability weighting, targeted maximum likelihood, or moment condition augmentation).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Detailed Assessment of the MRIV Framework**\\n\\n#### **I. Theoretical Soundness**\\n\\n1.  **Identifiability of the Causal Estimand:**\\n    *   **Strength:** The foundation of any IV method is the identification of the causal parameter. If the MRIV framework aims to estimate standard IV estimands (e.g., the Wald estimator for a constant treatment effect, or a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)), the theoretical soundness relies on the *standard IV assumptions* (relevance, exclusion restriction, monotonicity for LATE, independence of instrument and potential outcomes/treatments conditional on covariates).\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The framework must clearly define the estimand it targets (e.g., ATE, LATE, or a structural parameter in a linear/nonlinear model). The chosen identifying assumptions must be clearly stated and justified. The \"multiple robustness\" property primarily addresses the functional form specification of *nuisance functions*, not the fundamental untestable IV assumptions themselves. The method should correctly derive the moment conditions or score functions that, when expectation is taken, yield the desired causal parameter.\\n\\n2.  **Construction of Robust Estimating Equations/Score Functions:**\\n    *   **Strength:** The core idea of multiple robustness is to construct an estimating equation (or a score function) for the causal parameter such that it remains valid (i.e., its expectation is zero at the true parameter value) even if some parts of the model (nuisance functions) are misspecified, provided *at least one* specified path is correct. This is typically achieved through \"orthogonalization\" or \"augmentation.\"\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The mathematical derivation of these robust moment conditions is critical. It must be shown that the bias terms arising from misspecification of one set of nuisance functions precisely cancel out if another set is correctly specified. This often involves intricate algebraic manipulation of the influence function. A common approach involves models for:\\n        *   Outcome regression (e.g., $E[Y|D,X]$)\\n        *   First-stage regression (e.g., $E[D|Z,X]$)\\n        *   Reduced-form regression (e.g., $E[Y|Z,X]$)\\n        *   Propensity score for treatment (e.g., $P(D=1|Z,X)$)\\n        *   Potentially, conditional expectations of Y or D given just X ($E[Y|X]$, $E[D|X]$).\\n    *   The \"multiple\" aspect implies consistency under more than two correct specifications, which is much harder to achieve than standard double robustness and requires very specific structures or additional assumptions. The framework needs to explicitly state *which specific combinations* of correct models guarantee consistency.\\n\\n3.  **Semi-parametric Efficiency (Potential):**\\n    *   **Strength:** Well-designed doubly robust estimators are often semi-parametrically efficient when *all* nuisance functions are correctly specified. This means they achieve the lowest possible asymptotic variance among all regular, asymptotically linear estimators in the given semi-parametric model.\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The MRIV framework should prove whether it attains this efficiency bound. If it does, this is a significant theoretical advantage. If not, the trade-off between robustness and efficiency needs to be discussed.\\n\\n#### **II. Multiple Robustness Claims**\\n\\n1.  **Clarity and Specificity:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The term \"multiple robustness\" can sometimes be used loosely. It is crucial for the framework to define precisely what \"multiple\" means:\\n        *   Is it merely \"doubly robust\" with respect to two main sets of nuisance functions (e.g., outcome model vs. treatment assignment model), where each set might itself contain multiple components (e.g., $E[Y|D,X]$ and $E[D|Z,X]$ in one set, vs. $E[Y|Z,X]$ and $E[D|X]$ in another)? This is common for DR-IV estimators.\\n        *   Or does it imply consistency if *any* of $k$ distinct models are correct, even if $k-1$ are misspecified? This level of true \"k-fold\" robustness is exceedingly difficult to achieve in practice, especially for IV, and typically requires very strong assumptions or specific model structures.\\n    *   The paper must present explicit theorems for each path to consistency: \"If nuisance models A are correctly specified, the estimator is consistent. If nuisance models B are correctly specified, the estimator is consistent.\" And if there are more paths, each must be clearly delineated.\\n\\n2.  **Mechanism for Multiple Robustness:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The paper must show *how* the multiple robustness is achieved. This usually involves defining a set of moment conditions where, under different correct specifications, the problematic terms (those arising from misspecified nuisance functions) cancel out. For instance, in an AIPW-type estimator, specific terms might vanish due to zero means or conditional expectations. The mathematical proofs for these cancellations are paramount.\\n\\n#### **III. Validity of Assumptions**\\n\\n1.  **Standard IV Assumptions (Fundamental and Untestable):**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The MRIV framework *does not* relax the core identifying IV assumptions. These remain critical:\\n        *   **Relevance:** The instrument $Z$ must have a non-zero causal effect on the endogenous treatment $D$, conditional on covariates $X$ ($Cov(Z,D|X) \\\\ne 0$). This is often testable.\\n        *   **Exclusion Restriction:** The instrument $Z$ must affect the outcome $Y$ *only* through its effect on $D$, conditional on $X$. This is typically the most contentious and untestable assumption.\\n        *   **Independence/Exogeneity:** The instrument $Z$ must be independent of the potential outcomes and potential treatments (or unobserved confounders) conditional on $X$.\\n        *   **Monotonicity (for LATE):** If targeting LATE, the instrument must affect all individuals in the same direction (no defiers).\\n    *   The MRIV framework offers robustness to *functional form assumptions for nuisance parameters*, not to these fundamental IV assumptions. This distinction must be made crystal clear. If the core IV assumptions fail, the MRIV estimator will be biased, regardless of its robustness to nuisance function misspecification.\\n\\n2.  **Nuisance Function Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Correct Specification (of at least one set):** This is the central assumption enabling robustness. The framework must clearly state the *types* of nuisance functions (e.g., conditional means, conditional probabilities) and their properties (e.g., smooth, well-behaved).\\n    *   **Common Support:** For methods relying on propensity scores or inverse probability weighting, common support (i.e., $0 < P(D=d|Z,X) < 1$ and $0 < P(Z=z|X) < 1$) is often required. This is a practical concern, especially in high dimensions.\\n    *   **Regularity Conditions:** Standard statistical regularity conditions (e.g., finite moments, differentiability, non-singular matrices) are typically assumed for consistency and asymptotic normality.\\n\\n3.  **Assumptions on Estimation of Nuisance Functions:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** If nuisance functions are estimated using non-parametric or machine learning methods (as is common with DR estimators), the assumptions on their convergence rates are crucial. For standard doubly robust estimators, if the product of the errors in estimating the two nuisance functions converges at a rate faster than $n^{-1/2}$ (e.g., if each converges at $n^{-1/4}$), the main parameter can still be root-n consistent.\\n    *   For *multiple* robustness (more than two paths), the requirements for nuisance function estimation can become even more stringent (e.g., faster rates for each individual nuisance function, or specific conditions on how products of multiple errors behave) to maintain root-n consistency of the causal parameter. The framework must detail these requirements and show that the chosen estimation methods (e.g., specific ML algorithms) satisfy them.\\n\\n#### **IV. Correctness of Convergence Rate Analysis**\\n\\n1.  **Root-n Consistency:**\\n    *   **Strength:** The goal for any estimand in econometrics is typically $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, allowing for standard inference. The MRIV framework must rigorously prove that the causal parameter estimate is $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistent under the specified robustness conditions.\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** This proof involves showing that the score function, evaluated at the true parameter and estimated nuisance functions, has an asymptotically linear representation. The key is to demonstrate that the remainder terms involving errors from nuisance function estimation are of a sufficiently small order, typically $o_p(n^{-1/2})$.\\n\\n2.  **Influence Function and Asymptotic Normality:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** The derivation of the influence function is essential for establishing asymptotic normality and constructing standard errors. The influence function will reveal how estimation errors in the nuisance functions affect the main parameter. For multiple robustness, the influence function needs to reflect the orthogonality/cancellation properties.\\n\\n3.  **Impact of Non-Parametric Nuisance Estimation:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** If non-parametric or high-dimensional nuisance function estimation is employed, the rate analysis becomes more complex. The framework must correctly invoke relevant theorems (e.g., from Newey, Robins, Chernozhukov, et al.) that govern the behavior of such estimators when used as inputs for a main parameter. The \"rate conditions\" for nuisance function estimation (e.g., $n^{1/4}$ or faster for each, or a combined error product rate) must be clearly stated and justified. A common pitfall is to assume the plug-in estimator behaves as if the nuisance functions were known, which is only true under specific orthogonality conditions and sufficiently fast rates.\\n\\n4.  **Optimality Claims:**\\n    *   **Scrutiny Point:** If the framework claims \"optimality\" (e.g., semi-parametric efficiency), it must formally show that its asymptotic variance attains the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the given model, under the condition that *all* nuisance functions are correctly specified. This often involves deriving the efficient score function and showing that the proposed estimator\\'s influence function matches it.\\n\\n### **Potential Flaws or Inconsistencies in the Methodology (General Points to Look For)**\\n\\n1.  **Vague \"Multiple Robustness\" Claims:** If the specific paths to consistency are not precisely defined or proven, the robustness claim is weak.\\n2.  **Overlooking Fundamental IV Assumption Vulnerabilities:** If the framework implies that it mitigates the untestable nature of the exclusion restriction, it\\'s a critical misrepresentation. Its robustness is about *functional forms*, not unobserved confounding.\\n3.  **Unrealistic Nuisance Function Rate Requirements:** If the framework claims root-n consistency with non-parametric nuisance estimation but requires rates (e.g., $n^{1/2}$) that are unachievable for typical non-parametric methods, it\\'s a fatal flaw.\\n4.  **Curse of Dimensionality:** If many nuisance functions need to be estimated non-parametrically in high-dimensional covariate spaces, the finite-sample performance might be poor, even if asymptotic theory holds. The framework should acknowledge practical limitations.\\n5.  **Computational Complexity:** Estimating multiple, potentially non-linear, nuisance functions and solving complex augmented moment conditions can be computationally intensive and numerically unstable.\\n6.  **Lack of Empirical Guidance:** A theoretically sound framework also needs practical guidance on how to choose and estimate the nuisance functions (e.g., parametric, non-parametric, specific ML algorithms) and how to diagnose when one path might be better than another.\\n7.  **Finite Sample Performance:** While asymptotic properties are key, strong finite sample performance is also desirable. Sometimes, highly robust estimators can have larger finite-sample variance if the models are only slightly misspecified.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weighted Recommendation**\\n\\n**Weighted Recommendation: Conditional Accept (with Strong Reservations if Claims are Overstated)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nThe conceptual goal of an MRIV framework\u2014to combine the strengths of IV with the resilience of multiple robustness\u2014is theoretically appealing and highly valuable. Model misspecification is a pervasive problem, and reducing reliance on a single, potentially incorrect, functional form assumption is a significant advancement. Prior work on doubly robust IV (e.g., Chernozhukov et al. (2016), Rothe and Firpo (2018)) demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of such approaches.\\n\\nHowever, the \"multiple\" in MRIV introduces a higher level of complexity and scrutiny. The acceptance hinges entirely on the **rigor and precision** with which the framework addresses the following:\\n\\n*   **Clarity on \"Multiple\" Robustness:** Is it genuinely more than two distinct paths to consistency, or is it a doubly robust estimator with multiple *components* within each of the two paths? The latter is more common and achievable. The specific conditions for each path must be laid out with formal proofs of cancellation.\\n*   **Proof of Rate Preservation:** The most challenging aspect for any non-parametrically estimated DR/MR estimator is proving that the estimation errors of the nuisance functions do not degrade the $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistency of the causal parameter. If non-parametric/ML methods are used for nuisance functions, the paper must provide rigorous proofs that the required rate conditions are met (e.g., $n^{1/4}$ for each nuisance function or appropriate product of errors rates) and that the causal parameter\\'s influence function is truly orthogonal to the nuisance function scores.\\n*   **Addressing Fundamental IV Assumptions:** The framework must clearly state that its robustness is *conditional* on the standard, untestable IV assumptions (relevance, exclusion, exogeneity, monotonicity) holding. It offers no magic bullet against violations of these core assumptions.\\n*   **Practical Feasibility and Computational Considerations:** While asymptotic results are important, the framework should also discuss the practical implications, such as the curse of dimensionality for non-parametric nuisance estimation in high-dimensional covariate spaces, and the computational challenges.\\n\\nIf the framework presents detailed, rigorous mathematical proofs for its multiple robustness claims, precisely defines the conditions under which consistency and asymptotic normality hold (especially with estimated nuisance functions), and acknowledges the limitations with respect to core IV assumptions, it would be a significant contribution. Without such rigor, particularly regarding the \"multiple\" robustness and convergence rates, the claims would likely be considered unproven or overstated, warranting a stronger rejection.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9998.9372577}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'As an expert in causal inference, I will assess a hypothetical work based on the provided criteria. Since no specific paper is provided, I will outline the key elements one would look for in a robust instrumental variable (IV) analysis and how these elements relate to the broader causal inference landscape.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Assessment Framework for an Instrumental Variable Analysis**\\n\\n#### **1. Relevance and Applicability of the Instrumental Variable Assumptions**\\n\\nThis is the bedrock of any credible IV analysis. The paper must clearly state, justify, and ideally test (where possible) the core IV assumptions.\\n\\n*   **Relevance (First Stage):**\\n    *   **What it means:** The instrument (Z) must be sufficiently correlated with the treatment (D), conditional on covariates.\\n    *   **How to assess:** The paper should present a strong and statistically significant first-stage regression. An F-statistic (or Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F-statistic for multiple endogenous regressors/clustered errors) above 10 (or higher, depending on the number of instruments and endogenous variables) is a common rule of thumb to avoid weak IV bias.\\n    *   **Weaknesses to look for:** Low F-statistics indicate a weak instrument, leading to biased IV estimates (towards OLS bias) and highly inflated standard errors. The paper should discuss this if applicable and consider alternative methods or acknowledge limitations.\\n    *   **Applicability:** Is the instrument *practically* relevant in influencing the treatment? Is its connection to the treatment mechanism well-articulated?\\n\\n*   **Exclusion Restriction (Exogeneity):**\\n    *   **What it means:** The instrument (Z) affects the outcome (Y) *only* through its effect on the treatment (D). It should not have a direct effect on Y, nor should it affect Y through any other unobserved pathway.\\n    *   **How to assess:** This assumption is generally *untestable* and relies heavily on strong theoretical justification and domain expertise.\\n    *   **Crucial Evaluation Points:**\\n        *   Does the paper provide a compelling narrative or logical argument for why Z would not directly influence Y or do so via other pathways?\\n        *   Does it consider plausible alternative mechanisms (e.g., Z affecting Y through an omitted confounder or another variable that is not D)?\\n        *   Does it present falsification tests or placebo tests to bolster confidence (e.g., showing Z doesn\\'t affect pre-treatment outcomes or outcomes for a control group not subject to D)?\\n        *   Does it control for all relevant observed covariates that might be common causes of Z and Y, or Z and D?\\n\\n*   **Independence (Unconfoundedness of the Instrument):**\\n    *   **What it means:** The instrument (Z) must be as good as randomly assigned, or exogenous with respect to unobserved confounders that affect both the treatment (D) and the outcome (Y).\\n    *   **How to assess:** Similar to the exclusion restriction, this is largely untestable. It relies on the strength of the research design.\\n    *   **Crucial Evaluation Points:**\\n        *   Is the instrument truly \"as-if\" randomly assigned (e.g., lottery, natural experiment, policy cutoff)?\\n        *   Does the paper account for all observed confounders that might influence Z, D, and Y?\\n        *   Does it discuss potential unobserved confounders that might correlate with Z and independently influence D and/or Y? For example, if the instrument is a policy change, are there other contemporaneous changes that could also affect the outcome?\\n\\n*   **Monotonicity (No Defiers):**\\n    *   **What it means:** For the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) interpretation, there are no \"defiers\"\u2014individuals who would take the treatment if not encouraged, but not take it if encouraged. All individuals must respond to the instrument in the same direction (e.g., an encouragement to treat only encourages treatment, it doesn\\'t cause anyone to *stop* treatment).\\n    *   **How to assess:** This is often plausible in many policy contexts (e.g., encouragement to vaccinate only increases vaccination rates, it doesn\\'t decrease them). It can be violated in two-sided non-compliance scenarios.\\n    *   **Applicability:** Does the paper acknowledge that IV estimates, under these assumptions, typically identify the LATE for the \"compliers\" (those whose treatment status is influenced by the instrument), rather than the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for the entire population? Is this LATE relevant to the research question?\\n\\n#### **2. Handling of Unobserved Confounding**\\n\\nThe primary motivation for using IV is to address unobserved confounding.\\n\\n*   **Addressing Unobserved Confounding:**\\n    *   Does the paper clearly articulate *which* specific unobserved confounders it aims to address through the IV strategy?\\n    *   Does it present evidence (e.g., a comparison of OLS estimates to IV estimates) that suggests unobserved confounding is indeed biasing the non-IV estimates? A significant difference between OLS and IV, with plausible directions of bias, strengthens the argument for the need for IV.\\n    *   Does it discuss any *remaining* unobserved confounding that the IV strategy might *not* address (e.g., if the instrument itself is confounded in a way that violates the independence assumption)?\\n    *   Does it perform sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the results to slight violations of the IV assumptions (e.g., if there\\'s a small direct effect of Z on Y, or if Z is slightly confounded)?\\n\\n#### **3. Connection to Existing Causal Inference Literature**\\n\\nA strong paper grounds itself within the established body of causal inference knowledge.\\n\\n*   **Contextualization:** Does the paper correctly situate its IV application within the broader causal inference literature (e.g., Angrist & Pischke, Imbens, Wooldridge)? Does it acknowledge the LATE interpretation?\\n*   **Methodological Rigor:** Does it employ standard and appropriate IV estimation techniques (e.g., Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), GMM, limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) for weak IVs)? Does it correctly calculate standard errors (e.g., robust, clustered)?\\n*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Does it discuss why IV is the *most appropriate* method compared to other causal inference strategies (e.g., Regression Discontinuity, Difference-in-Differences, Matching, RCT) for the specific research question and data available? Is there a discussion of the trade-offs?\\n*   **Novelty/Contribution:** Does the paper propose a novel instrument, apply IV in a new context, or extend existing IV methodology? If so, does it clearly articulate this contribution?\\n\\n#### **4. Practical Significance and Potential Impact on Real-World Applications**\\n\\nBeyond methodological soundness, the work\\'s real-world utility is crucial.\\n\\n*   **Policy Relevance:** Does the research question address a significant policy issue or a practically important decision?\\n*   **Magnitude and Interpretability of Effects:** Are the estimated causal effects substantively meaningful? Are they presented in a way that is easily interpretable for policymakers or practitioners (e.g., \"a 1% increase in X leads to a Y unit change in Z\")?\\n*   **Generalizability:** Given that IV often identifies a LATE, how generalizable are the findings to other populations or contexts? Does the paper discuss the external validity of its findings?\\n*   **Limitations and Recommendations:** Does the paper transparently discuss the limitations of its findings, particularly concerning the IV assumptions and the LATE interpretation? Does it offer actionable recommendations based on its findings, while also acknowledging the scope of applicability?\\n*   **Cost-Benefit Implications:** If the treatment involves policy intervention, does the paper provide any insight into the potential cost-effectiveness or feasibility of implementing interventions based on the findings?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weighted Recommendation and Justification**\\n\\n**Recommendation: Accept with Moderate Revisions**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nMy recommendation is \"Accept with Moderate Revisions\" for a hypothetical paper utilizing instrumental variables. This reflects the inherent difficulty in satisfying all IV assumptions perfectly and the typical need for rigorous defense and robustness checks.\\n\\n*   **Strengths (Assuming a well-executed paper):**\\n    *   **Addresses a Fundamental Challenge:** The paper rightly attempts to tackle unobserved confounding, a critical issue in empirical research, by employing IV. This immediately places it within the realm of high-impact causal inference.\\n    *   **Methodological Sophistication:** The use of IV demonstrates an understanding of advanced econometric techniques necessary for robust causal claims.\\n    *   **Potential for High Impact:** If the IV strategy is credible, the findings could provide highly valuable, less-biased estimates of a causal effect, which could directly inform policy or practice.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Potential Revisions/Closer Scrutiny (Common Challenges in IV Papers):**\\n    *   **Rigorous Defense of IV Assumptions:** This is the most crucial area. Even if the paper clearly states the assumptions, the *justification* for the exclusion restriction and instrument exogeneity is often the weakest link. Reviewers will demand exceptionally strong, detailed arguments, supported by theory, institutional knowledge, and falsification tests. The paper *must* go beyond merely stating \"we believe the assumptions hold\" and provide compelling evidence or arguments.\\n    *   **Transparent Discussion of LATE:** While implied by IV, the paper needs to explicitly discuss the LATE interpretation, the characteristics of the complier population, and the implications for generalizability.\\n    *   **Robustness Checks:** A strong paper will include a comprehensive set of robustness checks, such as sensitivity analyses to potential violations of assumptions, alternative instrument specifications, and different sample definitions. This is often the area where papers can be significantly strengthened.\\n    *   **Comparison to Alternatives:** While IV is chosen for a reason, a brief discussion of why other methods (if applicable) were ruled out or how IV complements them would enhance the paper\\'s contribution.\\n    *   **Clarity of Interpretation:** Ensuring that the practical significance and policy implications are clearly articulated, without overstating the generalizability given the LATE, is key.\\n\\nIn essence, an IV paper is a high-reward, high-risk endeavor. The \"Accept with Moderate Revisions\" recommendation implies that the core idea, research question, and initial application of IV are sound, but the devil is in the details of defending its assumptions and rigorously testing the robustness of the results.

My assessment will highlight the critical components that *must* be present and well-executed for a strong evaluation, and what potential strengths and weaknesses a typical paper in this domain might exhibit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Evaluation of MRIV-Net Architecture, Experimental Setup, and Comparison\\n\\n**Overall Assessment Framework:** This evaluation assumes the paper aims to present a novel deep learning architecture (MRIV-Net) for a medical imaging task, likely involving MRI data and perhaps related to intravenous (IV) contrast or a specific anatomical structure (e.g., Intra-Ventricular). A strong paper would convincingly demonstrate the method\\'s superiority, practical utility, and reproducibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 1. MRIV-Net Architecture Design & Implementation\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Novelty and Rationale:** Does the architecture introduce genuinely new components or significant, well-justified modifications to existing ones? Is there a clear biological/clinical/computational rationale for each design choice (e.g., why a specific attention mechanism, why a certain type of convolution, why this particular encoder-decoder structure)?\\n*   **Efficiency:** Is the design computationally efficient (fewer parameters, faster inference) compared to previous methods, especially given medical imaging\\'s often large 3D volumes?\\n*   **Modularity and Scalability:** Is the architecture modular, allowing for easy adaptation or extension to different tasks or input sizes?\\n*   **Interpretability (if applicable):** Does the design inherently offer some level of interpretability or explainability, which is highly valued in medical AI?\\n*   **Implementation Details:** Are the specific layers, activation functions, regularization techniques, and skip connections clearly described and illustrated (e.g., with detailed diagrams)? Is the chosen deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and specific libraries mentioned?\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **Lack of Justification:** Design choices appear arbitrary without clear rationale or ablation studies supporting their necessity.\\n*   **Over-complexity:** The architecture might be unnecessarily complex, making it difficult to understand, debug, or generalize.\\n*   **Resource Intensive:** The model might be too large or slow for practical clinical deployment without high-end hardware.\\n*   **Lack of Open-source Implementation:** No publicly available code or clear instructions for replication.\\n\\n#### 2. Experimental Setup\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Dataset Quality and Diversity:**\\n    *   **Size:** Sufficiently large and diverse datasets (multiple centers, scanners, patient populations) to ensure generalizability.\\n    *   **Pre-processing:** Clearly described pre-processing steps (e.g., normalization, registration, bias correction, skull stripping).\\n    *   **Annotation:** Detailed explanation of how ground truth annotations were obtained (e.g., expert radiologists, consensus agreement) and their quality.\\n    *   **Data Splits:** Standard and transparent splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring no data leakage (e.g., patient-level splits rather than image-level splits for longitudinal data). Cross-validation or leave-one-out approaches for smaller datasets.\\n*   **Metrics:**\\n    *   **Appropriate Metrics:** Use of standard, widely accepted metrics relevant to the specific task (e.g., Dice Score, IoU, Hausdorff Distance for segmentation; Accuracy, F1-score, AUC for classification; MAE, RMSE for regression).\\n    *   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Reporting multiple metrics to provide a holistic view of performance, including those sensitive to small structures or boundary errors.\\n*   **Training Protocol:**\\n    *   **Hyperparameters:** All hyperparameters (learning rate schedule, batch size, optimizer, loss function, epochs, regularization, data augmentation strategy) are clearly listed.\\n    *   **Loss Function:** Justification for the chosen loss function (e.g., Dice loss for imbalance, cross-entropy, hybrid losses).\\n    *   **Augmentation:** Details on data augmentation strategies, which are crucial for medical imaging due to limited data.\\n    *   **Computational Resources:** Specification of GPU/CPU type, memory, and training time.\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **Small/Homogeneous Dataset:** Limited generalizability due to a small, single-center, or highly homogeneous dataset.\\n*   **Unclear Pre-processing:** Ambiguous or missing details on data preparation.\\n*   **Inappropriate Metrics:** Using metrics that don\\'t capture the true clinical utility or are insensitive to critical errors.\\n*   **Insufficient Details:** Missing crucial hyperparameters, making replication impossible.\\n*   **Data Leakage:** Incorrect data splitting that artificially inflates performance.\\n\\n#### 3. Comparison to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Baselines\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Relevant Baselines:** Comparison against a diverse set of strong, recent, and widely-cited SOTA methods that are either specifically designed for the same task or are general-purpose architectures commonly adapted for it. This should include methods from the past 1-3 years and potentially strong classical approaches if relevant.\\n*   **Fair Comparison:**\\n    *   **Identical Conditions:** All models (MRIV-Net and baselines) are trained and evaluated on the *exact same datasets*, using the *same data splits*, *same pre-processing*, and *same evaluation metrics*.\\n    *   **Optimized Baselines:** Baselines are run using their original, recommended hyperparameter settings or are re-optimized to ensure they perform at their best on the given dataset. Simply running a baseline with default settings or sub-optimally is a common pitfall.\\n    *   **Statistical Significance:** Use of statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) to confirm that performance differences are statistically significant, not just due to random chance.\\n*   **Quantitative and Qualitative Comparison:** Presentation of both numerical results (tables, charts) and qualitative examples (visualizations of predictions, error maps) that highlight MRIV-Net\\'s strengths and illustrate improvements.\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **Outdated/Weak Baselines:** Comparing only against older or weaker methods, making the proposed method appear better than it truly is.\\n*   **Unfair Comparison:**\\n    *   Comparing against reported results from other papers (which may use different datasets, splits, or metrics).\\n    *   Using sub-optimal hyperparameters for baselines while optimizing the proposed method.\\n*   **Lack of Statistical Analysis:** Presenting only mean performance without assessing statistical significance, making it difficult to ascertain if differences are meaningful.\\n*   **Cherry-picking Results:** Showing only favorable qualitative examples.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 4. Empirical Validation & Practical Utility\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Significant Performance Gains:** Demonstrating clear, substantial, and statistically significant improvements over SOTA baselines across multiple metrics and datasets.\\n*   **Generalizability:** Evidence that MRIV-Net performs well on unseen data from different sources (e.g., external validation cohort, multi-site study).\\n*   **Robustness:** Analysis of the model\\'s performance under challenging conditions (e.g., noisy images, artifacts, unusual anatomies, varying scanner protocols).\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Comprehensive ablation studies that systematically evaluate the contribution of each novel component of MRIV-Net, demonstrating that each part adds value. This is crucial for empirical validation.\\n*   **Efficiency Analysis:** Reporting inference speed, memory footprint, and model size, which are critical for practical deployment in clinical settings.\\n*   **Clinical Relevance:** Discussion of how the improved performance translates into real-world clinical benefits (e.g., faster diagnosis, improved treatment planning, reduced inter-observer variability). Is the output format useful for clinicians?\\n*   **Error Analysis:** Identifying failure modes and discussing the limitations of the proposed method.\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **Marginal Gains:** Only minor or statistically insignificant improvements, questioning the practical value of the new architecture.\\n*   **Poor Generalization:** Significant performance drop on external datasets.\\n*   **Lack of Robustness Testing:** No evaluation of performance in real-world, noisy conditions.\\n*   **Missing Ablation Studies:** Unclear which architectural components contribute to the performance.\\n*   **Computational Burden:** High inference time or memory requirements making it impractical.\\n*   **No Clinical Impact:** Failure to articulate how the method truly benefits clinical workflow or patient care.\\n\\n#### 5. Reproducibility\\n\\n**What to Look For (Strengths):**\\n*   **Code Availability:** Publicly available source code (e.g., GitHub repository) with clear instructions for setup, training, and evaluation.\\n*   **Pre-trained Weights:** Provision of pre-trained model weights.\\n*   **Environment Details:** Clearly specified software dependencies (e.g., Python version, library versions via `requirements.txt` or Conda environment file).\\n*   **Random Seeds:** All random seeds used for data splitting, weight initialization, and training are fixed and reported.\\n*   **Data Access:** Clear instructions on how to access the datasets used, or links to publicly available datasets.\\n\\n**Potential Weaknesses (if not addressed):**\\n*   **No Code:** The most significant barrier to reproducibility.\\n*   **Incomplete Code/Instructions:** Code that doesn\\'t run, missing setup steps, or ambiguous training procedures.\\n*   **Missing Hyperparameters/Seeds:** Inability to replicate exact training conditions.\\n*   **Proprietary Data:** Reliance on inaccessible private datasets without providing a clear path for others to replicate.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weighted Recommendation (Hypothetical)\\n\\nGiven the lack of the actual paper, I will provide a conditional recommendation based on how well the hypothetical paper addresses the above points.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** **Accept (Conditional / Minor Revision)**\\n\\n**Justification:**\\n\\nAssuming the paper provides comprehensive details on the MRIV-Net architecture, a well-designed experimental setup, and a fair comparison to state-of-the-art, it has the potential to be a valuable contribution.\\n\\n*   **For Acceptance:**\\n    *   **Architecture (Strong):** The architecture is novel, well-justified by ablation studies, computationally efficient, and clearly explained with diagrams.\\n    *   **Experimental Setup (Strong):** Utilizes diverse, sufficiently sized datasets with clear pre-processing and appropriate, widely-accepted metrics. Training protocols are fully transparent.\\n    *   **Comparison (Strong):** Benchmarks against relevant, strong SOTA baselines under identical and fair conditions, with statistical significance reported.\\n    *   **Empirical Validation (Strong):** Demonstrates substantial, consistent, and statistically significant performance gains.

Clear discussion of practical utility and clinical relevance with efficiency metrics.\\n    *   **Reproducibility (Strong):** Full code, pre-trained weights, environment details, and data access instructions are provided, making the results easily verifiable.\\n\\n*   **For Minor Revision (If some weaknesses are present):**\\n    *   **Architecture (Moderate):** Some architectural choices lack strong quantitative justification (e.g., minor components could be ablated for clarity).\\n    *   **Experimental Setup (Moderate):** Dataset size might be adequate but diversity could be improved (e.g., single-site data). Minor omissions in hyperparameter details.\\n    *   **Comparison (Moderate):** Baselines are mostly good but might miss one or two very recent SOTA methods. Statistical significance is presented but perhaps not for all metrics.\\n    *   **Empirical Validation (Moderate):** Performance gains are significant but generalizability might be shown on only one external dataset. Ablation studies are present but could be more exhaustive. Clinical utility is discussed but could benefit from more detailed impact analysis or user studies.\\n    *   **Reproducibility (Moderate):** Code is available but might require some minor setup tweaks, or all random seeds are not fully specified.\\n\\n**It would be a \"Reject\" or \"Major Revision\" if:**\\n*   The architecture lacks novelty or strong justification.\\n*   The experimental setup is critically flawed (e.g., data leakage, tiny dataset, inappropriate metrics).\\n*   The comparison to baselines is unfair or uses outdated/weak methods.\\n*   Empirical validation shows only marginal, inconsistent, or statistically insignificant gains, or lacks crucial ablation studies.\\n*   Reproducibility is severely hampered by missing code, data, or critical details.\\n*   The practical utility is not clearly demonstrated or the method is computationally prohibitive for real-world use.\\n\\nThis detailed breakdown provides a framework for assessing any deep learning paper, focusing on the empirical and practical aspects requested.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9998.9352711}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The agent assessments highlight several key points:\n\n*   **MethodRigorExpert:** Raises concerns about the rigor of the multiple robustness claims and the need for precise definitions and proofs.
