GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Over the years, many architectures such as VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet (He et al., 2016), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Kolesnikov et al., 2021) have been proposed that achieve competitive accuracies on many benchmarks including the ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) challenge. A key reason for the success of these models is their ability to learn useful representations of data (LeCun et al., 2015). Prior works have attempted to understand representations learned by deep neural networks through the lens of mutual information between the representations, inputs and outputs (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) and hypothesize that neural networks perform well because of a \u201ccompression\u201d phase where mutual information between inputs and representations decreases. Moreover recent works on interpretability have found that many neurons in learned representations are polysemantic, i.e., one neuron can encode multiple \u201cconcepts\u201d (Elhage et al., 2022; Olah et al., 2020), and that one can then train sparse linear models on such concepts to do \u201cexplainable\u201d classification (Wong et al., 2021). However, it is not well understood if or how extracted features are concentrated or spread across the full representation. While the length of the feature vectors extracted from state-of-the-art networks 1 can vary greatly, their accuracies on downstream tasks are not correlated to the size of the representation (see Table 1), but rather depend mostly on the inductive biases and training recipes (Wightman et al., 2021; Steiner et al., 2021). In all cases, the size of extracted feature vector (i.e. number of neurons) is orders of 1Extracted features for the purpose of this paper refers to the representation recorded on the penultimate layer, but the larger concept applies to any layer magnitude less than the dimensionality of the input (e.g.ImageNet models, the inputs are 224\u00d7224\u00d7 3 = 150528 dimensional) and thus allows efficient transfer to many downstream tasks (Kolesnikov et al., 2020; Bengio et al., 2013; Pan & Yang, 2009; Tan et al., 2018). We show that even when using a random subset of these extracted neurons one can achieve downstream transfer accuracy close to that achieved by the full layer, thus showing that learned representations exhibit a degree of redundancy (Table 1). Early works in perception suggest that there are many redundant neurons in the human visual cortex (Attneave, 1954) and some works argued that a similar redundancy in artificial neural networks should help in faster convergence (Izui & Pentland, 1990). In this paper we revisit redundancy in the context of modern DNN architectures that have been trained on large-scale datasets. In particular, we propose the diffused redundancy hypothesis and systematically measure its prevalence across different pre-training datasets, losses, model architectures and downstream tasks. We also show how this kind of redundancy can be exploited to obtain desirable properties such as generalization performance and better parity in inter-class performance. We highlight the following contributions: \u2022 We present the diffused redundancy hypothesis which states that learned representations exhibit redundancy that is diffused throughout the layer. Our work aims to better understand the nature of representations learned by DNNs. \u2022 We propose a measure of diffused redundancy and systematically test our hypothesis across various architectures, pre-training datasets & losses and downstream tasks. \u2013 We find that diffused redundancy is significantly impacted by pre-training datasets & loss and downstream datasets. \u2013 We find that models that are explicitly trained such that particular parts of the full representation perform as well as the full layer, i.e., these models have structured redundancy (e.g. (Kusupati et al., 2022)), also exhibit a significant amount of diffused redundancy, showing that this phenomenon is perhaps inevitable when DNNs have a wide enough final layer. \u2013 We quantify the degree of diffused redundancy as a function of the number of neurons in a given layer. As we reduce the dimension of the extracted feature vector and re-train the model, the degree of diffused redundancy decreases significantly, implying that diffused redundancy only appears when the layer is wide enough to accommodate redundancy. \u2022 Finally we draw caution to some potential undesirable side-effects of exploiting diffused redundancy for efficient transfer learning that have implications for fairness. 1.1 RELATED WORK: Closest to our work is that of Dalvi et al. (2020) who also investigate neuron redundancy but in the context of pre-trained language models. They analyze two language models and find that they can achieve good downstream performance with a significantly smaller subset of neurons. However, there are two key differences to our work. First, their analysis of neuron redundancy uses neurons from all layers (by concatenating each layer), whereas we show that such redundancy exists even at the level of a single (penultimate) layer. Second, and perhaps more importantly, they use feature selection to choose the subset of neurons, whereas we show that features are diffused throughout and that even a random pick of neurons suffices. Our work also differs by analyzing vision models (instead of language models) and using a diverse set of 21 pre-trained models (as opposed to testing only two models) which allows us to better understand the causes of such redundancy. Efficient Representation Learning These works aim to learn representations which are \u201cslim\u201d, with the goal of efficient deployment on edge devices (Yu et al., 2018; Yu & Huang, 2019; Cai et al., 2019). Recently proposed paradigm of Matryoshka Representation Learning (Kusupati et al., 2022) aims to learn nested representations where one can perform downstream tasks with only a small portion of the representation. The goal of such representations is to allow quick, adaptive deployment without having to perform multiple, often expensive, forward passes. These works could be seen as inducing structured redundancy on the learned representations, where pre-specified parts of the representation are made to perform similar to the full representation. Our work, instead, aims to looks at diffused redundancy that arises naturally in the training of DNNs. We carefully highlight the tradeoffs involved in exploiting this redundancy. Pruning and Compression Many prior works focus on pruning weights (LeCun et al., 1989; Han et al., 2015; Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Hassibi & Stork, 1992; Li et al., 2016; Levin et al., 1993; Dong et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018) and how it can lead to sparse neural networks with many weights turned off. Our focus, however, is on understanding redundancy at the neuron level, without changing the weights. Explainability/Interpretability Many works aim to understand learned representations with the goal of better explainability (Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2014; Yosinski et al., 2015; Alain & Bengio, 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Olah et al., 2017; 2020; Elhage et al., 2022; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013). However, two works are especially related to our work: sparse linear layers (Wong et al., 2021) which show that one can train sparse linear layers on top of extracted features from DNNs; and concept bottleneck models (Koh et al., 2020) which explicitly introduce a layer in which each neuron corresponds to a meaningful semantic concept. Both these works explicitly optimize for small/sparse layers, whereas our work shows that similar \u201csmall\u201d layers already exist in pre-trained networks, and in fact, can be found simply with random sampling. Understanding Deep Learning A related concept is that of instrinsic dimensionality of DNN landscapes (Li et al., 2018). Similar to our work, intrinsic dimensionality also requires dropping random parameters (weights) of the network. We, however, are concerned with dropping individual neurons. Other works on understanding deep learning (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017; Achille & Soatto, 2017) have also looked at the learned features, however none of these works analyze the redundancy at neuron level. 2 THE DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY PHENOMENON: Prior observations about a compression phase (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) suggest that the representations need not store a lot of information about the input; and observations about there being polysemantic neurons (Olah et al., 2020) states that one neuron can store multiple concepts. Both findings allude to the possibility of not needing all neurons in the learned feature space. Extending these observations, we propose the diffused redundancy hypothesis: Learned features are diffused throughout a given layer with redundancy such that a randomly chosen subset of neurons can perform similar to the whole layer for a variety of downstream tasks. Note that our hypothesis has two related but distinct parts to it: 1) redundancy in learned features, and 2) diffusion of this redundancy throughout the extracted feature vector. Redundancy refers to features being replicated in parts of the representation so that one can perform downstream tasks with parts of representation as well as with the full representation. Diffusion refers to this redundancy being spread all over the feature vector (as opposed to being structured), i.e., any random subset (of sufficient size) of the feature vector performs equally well. In order to evaluate the redundancy part of the diffused redundancy hypothesis we use two tasks: 1) representation similarity between randomly chosen subsets of a representation with the whole representation, and 2) transfer accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets (using a linear probe) of randomly chosen subsets of the representation compared to the whole representation. To estimate diffusion, we run each check for redundancy over multiple random seeds and plot the standard deviation over these runs. Representation Similarity of Part vs Whole Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) is a widely used representation similarity measure and takes in two representations of n data points Z \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 and Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 and gives a similarity score between 0 and 1 (Kornblith et al., 2019). Intuitively, CKA (with linear kernel, see Appendix A for details about CKA) measures if the two representations rank the n points similarly (where similarity is based on cosine distances). For a given neural network g and n samples drawn from a given data distribution, i.e., X \u223c D, let g(X) be the (penultimate) layer representation. If m is a boolean vector representing a subset of neurons in g(X), then we aim to measure CKA(m \u2299 g(X), g(X)) to estimate how much redundancy exists in the layer. If indeed CKA(m\u2299 g(X), g(X)) is high (i.e. close to 1) then it\u2019s a strong indication that the diffused redundancy hypothesis holds. Downstream Transfer Performance of Part vs Whole A commonly used paradigm to measure the quality of learned representations is to measure their performance on a variety of downstream tasks (Zhai et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). Here, we attach a linear layer (h) on top of the extracted features of a network (g) to do classification. This layer is then trained using the training dataset of the particular task (keeping g frozen). If features were to be diffused redundantly then accuracy obtained using h\u25e6g, i.e.linear layer attached to the entire feature vector, should be roughly the same as h\u2032 \u25e6 (m\u2299 g); where m is a boolean vector representing a subset of neurons extracted by g, and h & h\u2032 are independently trained linear probes. For both tasks, i.e. representation similarity and downstream transfer performance, we evaluate on CIFAR10/100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), Oxford-IIIT-Pets (Parkhi et al., 2012) and Flowers (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008) datasets, from the VTAB benchmark (Zhai et al., 2019). Training and pre-processing details are included in Appendix B. Measure of Diffused Redundancy In order to rigorously test our hypothesis, we define a measure of diffused redundancy (DR) for a given model (g) with M being a set of all possible boolean vectors of size |g|,i.e. size of the representation extracted from g. Each vector m \u2208 M represents a possible subset of neurons from the entire layer. This measure is defined on a particular task (T ) as follows: DR(g, T, \u03b4) = 1\u2212 min f , s.t. 1|Mf | \u2211 m\u2208Mf T (m\u2299g) T (g) \u2265 \u03b4 |g| , (1) Mf = { m \u2208 M| \u2211 i mi = f ; m \u2208 {0, 1}|g| } Here T (.) denotes the performance of the model inside () for the particular task and \u03b4 is a userdefined tolerance level. For the task for representation similarity T (m\u2299 g) is CKA between subset of neurons denoted by m \u2299 g and g, and T (g) is always 1, since it denotes CKA between g and g. For downstream transfer performance, T (m \u2299 g) is the test accuracy obtained by training a linear probe on the portion of representation denoted by m\u2299g and T (g) is the test accuracy obtained using the full representation. For \u03b4 = 1, this measure tells what fraction of neurons could be discarded to exactly match the performance of the entire set of neurons. A higher value of DR denotes that fewer random neurons could match the task performance of the full set of neurons, and thus indicates higher redundancy. Since M contains an exponential number of vectors (2|g|), precisely estimating this quantity is hard. Thus, we first choose a few f (number of neurons to be chosen) to define subsets of M. Then for each Mf we randomly select 5 samples. 2.1 PREVALENCE OF DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY IN PRE-TRAINED MODELS: Figure 1 checks for diffused redundancy in the penultimate layer representation of two types of ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet1k: one using the standard cross-entropy loss and another trained using adversarial training (Madry et al., 2019) (with \u21132 threat model and \u03f5 = 3). We check for diffused redundancy using both tasks of representation similarity and downstream transfer performance. Redundancy This is indicated along the x-axis of Fig 1, i.e., redundancy is shown when some small subset of the full set of neurons can achieve almost as good performance as the full set of neurons. When looking at downstream task performance (Figs 1a&1c), in order to obtain performance within some \u03b4% of the full layer accuracy (dotted lines), the fraction of neurons that can be discarded are task-dependent, e.g. across both training types we see that flowers (102 classes) and CIFAR100 (100 classes) require more fraction of neurons than CIFAR10 (10 classes) and oxford-iiit-pets (37 classes), perhaps because both these tasks have more classes. Additionally, across all datasets, the model trained with adversarial training exhibits more diffused redundancy (Fig 1b&1d) than the one trained with standard loss, meaning we can discard far more neurons for the adversarially trained model to reach close to the full layer accuracy. Interestingly when looking at CKA between part of the feature vector with the full extracted vector (Figs 1e&1f), we do not see a significant difference in trends when evaluating CKA on samples from different datasets. However, we still see that we can achieve a given level of CKA with far fewer fraction of neurons in the adversarially trained ResNet50 as compared to the usually trained ResNet50. Diffusion This is indicated by small error bars in Figs 1a&1c&1e&1f. If redundancy were instead very structured, then different random picks of neurons would have high variance, however the error bars here are very low, showing that performance is very stable across different random picks, thus indicating that redundancy is diffused throughout the layer. While both tasks of downstream transfer and CKA between part and whole indicate higher diffused redundancy for the adversarially trained model, we see that downstream transfer performance can differ substantially based on the dataset (while CKA remains fairly stable across the same datasets), indicating that downstream performance turns out to be a \u201charder\u201d test for diffused redundancy. Thus, in the rest of the paper we examine diffused redundancy through the lens of downstream transfer performance and include CKA results in Appendix A. 2.2 UNDERSTANDING WHY Any RANDOM SUBSET WORKS Many prior works explicitly train models to that have \u201csmall\u201d representations (e.g. (Kusupati et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2018; Yu & Huang, 2019; Cai et al., 2019) with the goal of efficient downstream learning. These works show that, when explicitly optimized, networks can perform downstream classification with fewer neurons than typically used in state-of-the-art architectures. We show, however, that such subsets already exist in models that are not explicitly trained for this goal and in fact one doesn\u2019t even have to try hard to find this subset; it can be randomly chosen. Later in section 3.3 we compare some of these efficient representation learning methods to randomly chosen subsets and carefully analyze the tradeoffs involved. Here, however, we seek to better understand why (almost) any random subset works. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Fraction of Neurons (Total=2048) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 CK A cifar10 cifar100 flowers oxford-iiit-pets (a) Standard Training 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Fraction of Neurons (Total=2048) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 CK A cifar10 cifar100 flowers oxford-iiit-pets (b) Adversarial Training Figure 2: [Why Any Random Subset Works] Similarity between any two randomly picked sets of k% neurons becomes fairly high (for a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of k%), thus showing that any random pick beyond this threshold is likely to perform similarly. We analyze this through the lens of representation similarity (Kornblith et al., 2019). More specifically, we calculate CKA between two random picks of k% neurons in the penultimate layer (averaged over 10 such randomly picked pairs) on samples taken from different datasets. Fig 2 shows CKA results averaged over these different picks of pairs of subsets of the full set of neurons. We see that after a picking a certain threshold, i.e. for a large enough value of k, the similarity between any two randomly picked pairs of heads is fairly high. For example, for the adversarially trained ResNet50 (Fig 2b), we observe that any 10% of neurons picked from the penultimate layer are highly similar (CKA of about 0.8), with very low error bars. A similar value of CKA is obtained with 20% of neurons for the standard ResNet50 model. These results indicate that, given a sufficient size, picking any random subset of that size has very similar representations and this provides some intuition for why any random subset works equally well. 3 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DEGREE OF DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY: In order to better understand the phenomenon of diffused redundancy we analyze 21 different pretrained models, with different architectures, pre-training datasets and losses. We then evaluate each model for transfer accuracy on 4 datasets mentioned in Section 2. Architectures We consider VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet18, ResNet50, WideResNet50-2 (He et al., 2016), ViT-S16 & ViT-S32 (Kolesnikov et al., 2021). Additionally we consider ResNet50 with varying widths of the final layer (denoted by ResNet50 ffx where x denotes the number of neurons in the final layer). Upstream Datasets ImageNet-1k & ImageNet-21k Russakovsky et al. (2015). Upstream Losses Standard cross-entropy, adversarial training (\u21132 threat model, \u03f5 = 3) (Madry et al., 2019), MRL Loss (Kusupati et al., 2022). Downstream Datasets CIFAR10/1000, Oxford-IIIT-Pets, and Flowers, same as Section 2. Pre-trained weights for adversarially trained models were taken from (Salman et al., 2020). Weights for ViTs (both ImageNet21k and ImageNet1k) were taken from the code released by (Kolesnikov et al., 2021; Steiner et al., 2021). All ResNet50 ffx and the ResNet50 trained with MRL loss were taken from code released by (Kusupati et al., 2022), and all standard models were taken from timm and torchvision (Wightman, 2019; Paszke et al., 2019). 3.1 EFFECTS OF ARCHITECTURE, UPSTREAM LOSS, UPSTREAM DATASETS, AND DOWNSTREAM DATASETS: Extending the analysis in Section 2, we evaluate the diffused redundancy hypothesis on other architectures. Fig 3 shows transfer performance for different architectures. All architectures shown in Fig 3 are trained on ImageNet1k. We find that our takeaways from Section 2 also extend to other architectures. Fig 4 compares two instances each of ViT-S16 and ViT-S32, one trained on a bigger upstream dataset (ImageNet21k) and another on a smaller dataset (ImageNet1k) Note that nature of all curves in both Figs 3&4 highly depends on downstream datasets. This is also consistent with the initial observation of Section 2 about diffused redundancy being downstream dataset dependent. 3.2 DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY AS A FUNCTION OF LAYER WIDTH: We take the usual ResNet50 with a penultimate layer consisting of 2048 neurons and compare it with variants that are pre-trained with a much smaller penultimate layer, these are denoted by ResNet50 ffx where x (< 2048) is the number of neurons in the penultimate layer. Fig 5 shows how diffused redundancy slows fades away as we squeeze the layer to be smaller. In fact, for ResNet50 ff8, we see that across all datasets we need > 90% of the full layer to achieve performance close to the full layer. This shows that diffused redundancy only appears in DNNs when the layer is sufficiently wide to encode redundancy. 3.3 COMPARISON WITH METHODS THAT OPTIMIZE FOR LESSER NEURONS: Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is a recently proposed paradigm which learns nested representations such that first k, 2k, 4k, ..., N (where N = size of the full layer) dimensions of the extracted feature vector are all explicitly made to be good at minimizing upstream loss, with the intuition of learning coarse-to-fine representations. This ensures that one can flexibly use these smaller parts of the representation for downstream tasks. MRL, thus, ensures that redundancy shows up in learned representations in a structured way, i.e., we know the first k, 2k, ... neurons can be picked and used for downstream tasks and should perform reasonably. Here we investigate two questions regarding Matryoshka representations: 1) do these representations also exhibit the phenomenon of diffused redundancy? i.e. if we were to ignore the structure imposed by MRL-type training and instead just pick random neurons from all over the layer, do we still get reasonable performance?, and 2) how do they compare to representations learned by other kinds of losses? Figure 6 investigates these questions by comparing ResNet50 representations learned using MRL loss to other losses. resnet50 mrl nonrob first (red line) denotes resnet50 learned using MRL loss and evaluated on parts of representation that were optimized to have low upstream loss (i.e. first k, 2k, ...N neurons, here k = 8 and N = 2048) and resnet50 mrl nonrob random (green line) refers to the same model with same number of neurons chosen for evaulation, except they\u2019re chosen at random from the entire layer. First, we interestingly see that even the ResNet50 trained with MRL loss exhibits diffused redundancy (denoted by green line spiking very quickly for most datasets in Fig 6), despite having been trained to only have structured redundancy. Based on this observation we conjecture that diffused redundancy is a natural consequence of having a wide layer. Second, we see that ResNet50 trained on MRL indeed does better in the low neuron regime across datasets (red line on the extreme left part of the plots in Fig 6), but other models quickly catch up as we pick more neurons, thus indicating that major efficiency benefits of MRL-type models are best realized when using extremely low number of neurons, else one can obtain similar downstream performances by simply picking random samples from existing pre-trained models. 4 POSSIBLE FAIRNESS-EFFICIENCY TRADEOFFS IN EFFICIENT DOWNSTREAM TRANSFER: One natural use-case for diffused redundancy is efficient transfer to downstream datasets, i.e., use only a random subset instead of the entire feature vector. This would lead to faster training and lesser storage requirements since it reduces number of additional parameters. As defined in Eq 1 and as also seen in prior works (e.g. Kusupati et al. (2022)) dropping neurons comes at a small cost in performance as compared to the full set of neurons. Here we take a deeper look into this drop in overall performance and investigate how it is distributed across classes. If the drop affects only a few classes, then dropping neurons \u2013 although efficient for downstream tasks \u2013 could have implications for fairness, which is not only of concern to ML researchers and practitioners (Zafar et al., 2017; Hardt et al., 2016; Holstein et al., 2019), but also to lawyers Tolan et al. (2019) and policymakers (Veale et al., 2018). We compare the spread of accuracies across classes using inequality indices, which are commonly used in economics to study income inequality (De Maio, 2007; Schutz, 1951) and have also recently been adopted in the fair ML literature (Speicher et al., 2018). We use gini index (Gini, 1921) and coefficient of variation (Lawrence, 1997) to quantify the spread of performance across classes. For a perfect spread, both gini and coefficient of variation are 0, and higher values indicate higher inequality. Figure 7 compares the gini index for various models at varying levels of accuracy (note that accuracy monotonically increases with more neurons, hence right more point for a model represents the model with all neurons). We make two observations: across all datasets and all models we find that a loss in accuracy (compared to the full layer) comes at the cost of a few classes, as opposed being smeared throughout classes, as indicated by high gini values on the left of each plot. Additionally, we observe that the model trained using MRL loss tends to have slightly higher gini values in the regions where drop in accuracy is slightly higher (highlighted on the plots). Similar trends are also observed with coeff. of variation as shown in Appendix C. These results draw caution to potential unintended side-effects of exploiting diffused redundancy and suggest that there could be a possible fairness-efficiency tradeoff involved. 5 CONCLUSION AND BROADER IMPACTS: We introduce the diffused redundancy hypothesis and analyze a wide range of models with different upstream training datasets & losses, architectures. We carefully analyze the causes of such redundancy and find that upstream training (both loss and datasets) plays a crucial role and that this redundancy also depends on the downstream dataset. One direct practical consequence of our observation is increased efficiency for downstream training times which can have many positive impacts in terms of reduced energy costs (Strubell et al., 2019) which is crucial in moving towards \u201cgreen\u201d AI (Schwartz et al., 2020). We, however, also draw caution to potential pitfalls of such efficiency gains in Section 4, which might hurt the accuracy of certain classes more than others, thus having direct consequences for fairness. We see our work as a contribution to the scholarship on better understanding deep learning through an empirical lens, while also highlighting possible pitfalls. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT We include all training and pre-processing details in Appendix B. We have also attached all the code used to generate the results in our paper. All of our evaulation is based on standard publicly available datasets which we have cited throughout the paper (and our code contains scripts to automatically download these datasets). Appendix B also includes links to all pre-trained models (with proper citations) so that exact numbers can be replicated. A MEASURING DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY: A.1 CKA DEFINITION In all our evaluations we use CKA with a linear kernel (Kornblith et al., 2019) which essentially amounts to the following steps: 1. Take two representations Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 and Z \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 2. Compute dot product similarity within these representation, i.e.compute K = Y Y T , L = ZZT 3. Normalize K and L to get K \u2032 = HKH , L\u2032 = HLH where H = In \u2212 1n11 T 4. Return CKA(Y, Z) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , where HSIC(K,L) = 1(n\u22121)2 (flatten(K \u2032) \u00b7 flatten(L\u2032)) We use the publicly available implementation of Nanda et al. (2022), which provides an implementation that can be calcuated over multiple mini-batches: https://github.com/nvedant07/ STIR A.2 ADDITIONAL CKA RESULTS Fig 8 shows CKA comparison between randomly chosen parts of the layer and the full layer for different kinds of ResNet50. We observe that even ResNet50 trained with MRL loss shows a significant amount of diffused redundancy.

The paper title is: Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Over the years, many architectures such as VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet (He et al., 2016), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Kolesnikov et al., 2021) have been proposed that achieve competitive accuracies on many benchmarks including the ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) challenge. A key reason for the success of these models is their ability to learn useful representations of data (LeCun et al., 2015). Prior works have attempted to understand representations learned by deep neural networks through the lens of mutual information between the representations, inputs and outputs (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) and hypothesize that neural networks perform well because of a \u201ccompression\u201d phase where mutual information between inputs and representations decreases. Moreover recent works on interpretability have found that many neurons in learned representations are polysemantic, i.e., one neuron can encode multiple \u201cconcepts\u201d (Elhage et al., 2022; Olah et al., 2020), and that one can then train sparse linear models on such concepts to do \u201cexplainable\u201d classification (Wong et al., 2021). However, it is not well understood if or how extracted features are concentrated or spread across the full representation. While the length of the feature vectors extracted from state-of-the-art networks 1 can vary greatly, their accuracies on downstream tasks are not correlated to the size of the representation (see Table 1), but rather depend mostly on the inductive biases and training recipes (Wightman et al., 2021; Steiner et al., 2021). In all cases, the size of extracted feature vector (i.e. number of neurons) is orders of 1Extracted features for the purpose of this paper refers to the representation recorded on the penultimate layer, but the larger concept applies to any layer magnitude less than the dimensionality of the input (e.g.ImageNet models, the inputs are 224\u00d7224\u00d7 3 = 150528 dimensional) and thus allows efficient transfer to many downstream tasks (Kolesnikov et al., 2020; Bengio et al., 2013; Pan & Yang, 2009; Tan et al., 2018). We show that even when using a random subset of these extracted neurons one can achieve downstream transfer accuracy close to that achieved by the full layer, thus showing that learned representations exhibit a degree of redundancy (Table 1). Early works in perception suggest that there are many redundant neurons in the human visual cortex (Attneave, 1954) and some works argued that a similar redundancy in artificial neural networks should help in faster convergence (Izui & Pentland, 1990). In this paper we revisit redundancy in the context of modern DNN architectures that have been trained on large-scale datasets. In particular, we propose the diffused redundancy hypothesis and systematically measure its prevalence across different pre-training datasets, losses, model architectures and downstream tasks. We also show how this kind of redundancy can be exploited to obtain desirable properties such as generalization performance and better parity in inter-class performance. We highlight the following contributions: \u2022 We present the diffused redundancy hypothesis which states that learned representations exhibit redundancy that is diffused throughout the layer. Our work aims to better understand the nature of representations learned by DNNs. \u2022 We propose a measure of diffused redundancy and systematically test our hypothesis across various architectures, pre-training datasets & losses and downstream tasks. \u2013 We find that diffused redundancy is significantly impacted by pre-training datasets & loss and downstream datasets. \u2013 We find that models that are explicitly trained such that particular parts of the full representation perform as well as the full layer, i.e., these models have structured redundancy (e.g. (Kusupati et al., 2022)), also exhibit a significant amount of diffused redundancy, showing that this phenomenon is perhaps inevitable when DNNs have a wide enough final layer. \u2013 We quantify the degree of diffused redundancy as a function of the number of neurons in a given layer. As we reduce the dimension of the extracted feature vector and re-train the model, the degree of diffused redundancy decreases significantly, implying that diffused redundancy only appears when the layer is wide enough to accommodate redundancy. \u2022 Finally we draw caution to some potential undesirable side-effects of exploiting diffused redundancy for efficient transfer learning that have implications for fairness. 1.1 RELATED WORK: Closest to our work is that of Dalvi et al. (2020) who also investigate neuron redundancy but in the context of pre-trained language models. They analyze two language models and find that they can achieve good downstream performance with a significantly smaller subset of neurons. However, there are two key differences to our work. First, their analysis of neuron redundancy uses neurons from all layers (by concatenating each layer), whereas we show that such redundancy exists even at the level of a single (penultimate) layer. Second, and perhaps more importantly, they use feature selection to choose the subset of neurons, whereas we show that features are diffused throughout and that even a random pick of neurons suffices. Our work also differs by analyzing vision models (instead of language models) and using a diverse set of 21 pre-trained models (as opposed to testing only two models) which allows us to better understand the causes of such redundancy. Efficient Representation Learning These works aim to learn representations which are \u201cslim\u201d, with the goal of efficient deployment on edge devices (Yu et al., 2018; Yu & Huang, 2019; Cai et al., 2019). Recently proposed paradigm of Matryoshka Representation Learning (Kusupati et al., 2022) aims to learn nested representations where one can perform downstream tasks with only a small portion of the representation. The goal of such representations is to allow quick, adaptive deployment without having to perform multiple, often expensive, forward passes. These works could be seen as inducing structured redundancy on the learned representations, where pre-specified parts of the representation are made to perform similar to the full representation. Our work, instead, aims to looks at diffused redundancy that arises naturally in the training of DNNs. We carefully highlight the tradeoffs involved in exploiting this redundancy. Pruning and Compression Many prior works focus on pruning weights (LeCun et al., 1989; Han et al., 2015; Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Hassibi & Stork, 1992; Li et al., 2016; Levin et al., 1993; Dong et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018) and how it can lead to sparse neural networks with many weights turned off. Our focus, however, is on understanding redundancy at the neuron level, without changing the weights. Explainability/Interpretability Many works aim to understand learned representations with the goal of better explainability (Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2014; Yosinski et al., 2015; Alain & Bengio, 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Olah et al., 2017; 2020; Elhage et al., 2022; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013). However, two works are especially related to our work: sparse linear layers (Wong et al., 2021) which show that one can train sparse linear layers on top of extracted features from DNNs; and concept bottleneck models (Koh et al., 2020) which explicitly introduce a layer in which each neuron corresponds to a meaningful semantic concept. Both these works explicitly optimize for small/sparse layers, whereas our work shows that similar \u201csmall\u201d layers already exist in pre-trained networks, and in fact, can be found simply with random sampling. Understanding Deep Learning A related concept is that of instrinsic dimensionality of DNN landscapes (Li et al., 2018). Similar to our work, intrinsic dimensionality also requires dropping random parameters (weights) of the network. We, however, are concerned with dropping individual neurons. Other works on understanding deep learning (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017; Achille & Soatto, 2017) have also looked at the learned features, however none of these works analyze the redundancy at neuron level. 2 THE DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY PHENOMENON: Prior observations about a compression phase (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) suggest that the representations need not store a lot of information about the input; and observations about there being polysemantic neurons (Olah et al., 2020) states that one neuron can store multiple concepts. Both findings allude to the possibility of not needing all neurons in the learned feature space. Extending these observations, we propose the diffused redundancy hypothesis: Learned features are diffused throughout a given layer with redundancy such that a randomly chosen subset of neurons can perform similar to the whole layer for a variety of downstream tasks. Note that our hypothesis has two related but distinct parts to it: 1) redundancy in learned features, and 2) diffusion of this redundancy throughout the extracted feature vector. Redundancy refers to features being replicated in parts of the representation so that one can perform downstream tasks with parts of representation as well as with the full representation. Diffusion refers to this redundancy being spread all over the feature vector (as opposed to being structured), i.e., any random subset (of sufficient size) of the feature vector performs equally well. In order to evaluate the redundancy part of the diffused redundancy hypothesis we use two tasks: 1) representation similarity between randomly chosen subsets of a representation with the whole representation, and 2) transfer accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets (using a linear probe) of randomly chosen subsets of the representation compared to the whole representation. To estimate diffusion, we run each check for redundancy over multiple random seeds and plot the standard deviation over these runs. Representation Similarity of Part vs Whole Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) is a widely used representation similarity measure and takes in two representations of n data points Z \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 and Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 and gives a similarity score between 0 and 1 (Kornblith et al., 2019). Intuitively, CKA (with linear kernel, see Appendix A for details about CKA) measures if the two representations rank the n points similarly (where similarity is based on cosine distances). For a given neural network g and n samples drawn from a given data distribution, i.e., X \u223c D, let g(X) be the (penultimate) layer representation. If m is a boolean vector representing a subset of neurons in g(X), then we aim to measure CKA(m \u2299 g(X), g(X)) to estimate how much redundancy exists in the layer. If indeed CKA(m\u2299 g(X), g(X)) is high (i.e. close to 1) then it\u2019s a strong indication that the diffused redundancy hypothesis holds. Downstream Transfer Performance of Part vs Whole A commonly used paradigm to measure the quality of learned representations is to measure their performance on a variety of downstream tasks (Zhai et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). Here, we attach a linear layer (h) on top of the extracted features of a network (g) to do classification. This layer is then trained using the training dataset of the particular task (keeping g frozen). If features were to be diffused redundantly then accuracy obtained using h\u25e6g, i.e.linear layer attached to the entire feature vector, should be roughly the same as h\u2032 \u25e6 (m\u2299 g); where m is a boolean vector representing a subset of neurons extracted by g, and h & h\u2032 are independently trained linear probes. For both tasks, i.e. representation similarity and downstream transfer performance, we evaluate on CIFAR10/100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), Oxford-IIIT-Pets (Parkhi et al., 2012) and Flowers (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008) datasets, from the VTAB benchmark (Zhai et al., 2019). Training and pre-processing details are included in Appendix B. Measure of Diffused Redundancy In order to rigorously test our hypothesis, we define a measure of diffused redundancy (DR) for a given model (g) with M being a set of all possible boolean vectors of size |g|,i.e. size of the representation extracted from g. Each vector m \u2208 M represents a possible subset of neurons from the entire layer. This measure is defined on a particular task (T ) as follows: DR(g, T, \u03b4) = 1\u2212 min f , s.t. 1|Mf | \u2211 m\u2208Mf T (m\u2299g) T (g) \u2265 \u03b4 |g| , (1) Mf = { m \u2208 M| \u2211 i mi = f ; m \u2208 {0, 1}|g| } Here T (.) denotes the performance of the model inside () for the particular task and \u03b4 is a userdefined tolerance level. For the task for representation similarity T (m\u2299 g) is CKA between subset of neurons denoted by m \u2299 g and g, and T (g) is always 1, since it denotes CKA between g and g. For downstream transfer performance, T (m \u2299 g) is the test accuracy obtained by training a linear probe on the portion of representation denoted by m\u2299g and T (g) is the test accuracy obtained using the full representation. For \u03b4 = 1, this measure tells what fraction of neurons could be discarded to exactly match the performance of the entire set of neurons. A higher value of DR denotes that fewer random neurons could match the task performance of the full set of neurons, and thus indicates higher redundancy. Since M contains an exponential number of vectors (2|g|), precisely estimating this quantity is hard. Thus, we first choose a few f (number of neurons to be chosen) to define subsets of M. Then for each Mf we randomly select 5 samples. 2.1 PREVALENCE OF DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY IN PRE-TRAINED MODELS: Figure 1 checks for diffused redundancy in the penultimate layer representation of two types of ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet1k: one using the standard cross-entropy loss and another trained using adversarial training (Madry et al., 2019) (with \u21132 threat model and \u03f5 = 3). We check for diffused redundancy using both tasks of representation similarity and downstream transfer performance. Redundancy This is indicated along the x-axis of Fig 1, i.e., redundancy is shown when some small subset of the full set of neurons can achieve almost as good performance as the full set of neurons. When looking at downstream task performance (Figs 1a&1c), in order to obtain performance within some \u03b4% of the full layer accuracy (dotted lines), the fraction of neurons that can be discarded are task-dependent, e.g. across both training types we see that flowers (102 classes) and CIFAR100 (100 classes) require more fraction of neurons than CIFAR10 (10 classes) and oxford-iiit-pets (37 classes), perhaps because both these tasks have more classes. Additionally, across all datasets, the model trained with adversarial training exhibits more diffused redundancy (Fig 1b&1d) than the one trained with standard loss, meaning we can discard far more neurons for the adversarially trained model to reach close to the full layer accuracy. Interestingly when looking at CKA between part of the feature vector with the full extracted vector (Figs 1e&1f), we do not see a significant difference in trends when evaluating CKA on samples from different datasets. However, we still see that we can achieve a given level of CKA with far fewer fraction of neurons in the adversarially trained ResNet50 as compared to the usually trained ResNet50. Diffusion This is indicated by small error bars in Figs 1a&1c&1e&1f. If redundancy were instead very structured, then different random picks of neurons would have high variance, however the error bars here are very low, showing that performance is very stable across different random picks, thus indicating that redundancy is diffused throughout the layer. While both tasks of downstream transfer and CKA between part and whole indicate higher diffused redundancy for the adversarially trained model, we see that downstream transfer performance can differ substantially based on the dataset (while CKA remains fairly stable across the same datasets), indicating that downstream performance turns out to be a \u201charder\u201d test for diffused redundancy. Thus, in the rest of the paper we examine diffused redundancy through the lens of downstream transfer performance and include CKA results in Appendix A. 2.2 UNDERSTANDING WHY Any RANDOM SUBSET WORKS Many prior works explicitly train models to that have \u201csmall\u201d representations (e.g. (Kusupati et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2018; Yu & Huang, 2019; Cai et al., 2019) with the goal of efficient downstream learning. These works show that, when explicitly optimized, networks can perform downstream classification with fewer neurons than typically used in state-of-the-art architectures. We show, however, that such subsets already exist in models that are not explicitly trained for this goal and in fact one doesn\u2019t even have to try hard to find this subset; it can be randomly chosen. Later in section 3.3 we compare some of these efficient representation learning methods to randomly chosen subsets and carefully analyze the tradeoffs involved. Here, however, we seek to better understand why (almost) any random subset works. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Fraction of Neurons (Total=2048) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 CK A cifar10 cifar100 flowers oxford-iiit-pets (a) Standard Training 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Fraction of Neurons (Total=2048) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 CK A cifar10 cifar100 flowers oxford-iiit-pets (b) Adversarial Training Figure 2: [Why Any Random Subset Works] Similarity between any two randomly picked sets of k% neurons becomes fairly high (for a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of k%), thus showing that any random pick beyond this threshold is likely to perform similarly. We analyze this through the lens of representation similarity (Kornblith et al., 2019). More specifically, we calculate CKA between two random picks of k% neurons in the penultimate layer (averaged over 10 such randomly picked pairs) on samples taken from different datasets. Fig 2 shows CKA results averaged over these different picks of pairs of subsets of the full set of neurons. We see that after a picking a certain threshold, i.e. for a large enough value of k, the similarity between any two randomly picked pairs of heads is fairly high. For example, for the adversarially trained ResNet50 (Fig 2b), we observe that any 10% of neurons picked from the penultimate layer are highly similar (CKA of about 0.8), with very low error bars. A similar value of CKA is obtained with 20% of neurons for the standard ResNet50 model. These results indicate that, given a sufficient size, picking any random subset of that size has very similar representations and this provides some intuition for why any random subset works equally well. 3 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DEGREE OF DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY: In order to better understand the phenomenon of diffused redundancy we analyze 21 different pretrained models, with different architectures, pre-training datasets and losses. We then evaluate each model for transfer accuracy on 4 datasets mentioned in Section 2. Architectures We consider VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet18, ResNet50, WideResNet50-2 (He et al., 2016), ViT-S16 & ViT-S32 (Kolesnikov et al., 2021). Additionally we consider ResNet50 with varying widths of the final layer (denoted by ResNet50 ffx where x denotes the number of neurons in the final layer). Upstream Datasets ImageNet-1k & ImageNet-21k Russakovsky et al. (2015). Upstream Losses Standard cross-entropy, adversarial training (\u21132 threat model, \u03f5 = 3) (Madry et al., 2019), MRL Loss (Kusupati et al., 2022). Downstream Datasets CIFAR10/1000, Oxford-IIIT-Pets, and Flowers, same as Section 2. Pre-trained weights for adversarially trained models were taken from (Salman et al., 2020). Weights for ViTs (both ImageNet21k and ImageNet1k) were taken from the code released by (Kolesnikov et al., 2021; Steiner et al., 2021). All ResNet50 ffx and the ResNet50 trained with MRL loss were taken from code released by (Kusupati et al., 2022), and all standard models were taken from timm and torchvision (Wightman, 2019; Paszke et al., 2019). 3.1 EFFECTS OF ARCHITECTURE, UPSTREAM LOSS, UPSTREAM DATASETS, AND DOWNSTREAM DATASETS: Extending the analysis in Section 2, we evaluate the diffused redundancy hypothesis on other architectures. Fig 3 shows transfer performance for different architectures. All architectures shown in Fig 3 are trained on ImageNet1k. We find that our takeaways from Section 2 also extend to other architectures. Fig 4 compares two instances each of ViT-S16 and ViT-S32, one trained on a bigger upstream dataset (ImageNet21k) and another on a smaller dataset (ImageNet1k) Note that nature of all curves in both Figs 3&4 highly depends on downstream datasets. This is also consistent with the initial observation of Section 2 about diffused redundancy being downstream dataset dependent. 3.2 DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY AS A FUNCTION OF LAYER WIDTH: We take the usual ResNet50 with a penultimate layer consisting of 2048 neurons and compare it with variants that are pre-trained with a much smaller penultimate layer, these are denoted by ResNet50 ffx where x (< 2048) is the number of neurons in the penultimate layer. Fig 5 shows how diffused redundancy slows fades away as we squeeze the layer to be smaller. In fact, for ResNet50 ff8, we see that across all datasets we need > 90% of the full layer to achieve performance close to the full layer. This shows that diffused redundancy only appears in DNNs when the layer is sufficiently wide to encode redundancy. 3.3 COMPARISON WITH METHODS THAT OPTIMIZE FOR LESSER NEURONS: Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is a recently proposed paradigm which learns nested representations such that first k, 2k, 4k, ..., N (where N = size of the full layer) dimensions of the extracted feature vector are all explicitly made to be good at minimizing upstream loss, with the intuition of learning coarse-to-fine representations. This ensures that one can flexibly use these smaller parts of the representation for downstream tasks. MRL, thus, ensures that redundancy shows up in learned representations in a structured way, i.e., we know the first k, 2k, ... neurons can be picked and used for downstream tasks and should perform reasonably. Here we investigate two questions regarding Matryoshka representations: 1) do these representations also exhibit the phenomenon of diffused redundancy? i.e. if we were to ignore the structure imposed by MRL-type training and instead just pick random neurons from all over the layer, do we still get reasonable performance?, and 2) how do they compare to representations learned by other kinds of losses? Figure 6 investigates these questions by comparing ResNet50 representations learned using MRL loss to other losses. resnet50 mrl nonrob first (red line) denotes resnet50 learned using MRL loss and evaluated on parts of representation that were optimized to have low upstream loss (i.e. first k, 2k, ...N neurons, here k = 8 and N = 2048) and resnet50 mrl nonrob random (green line) refers to the same model with same number of neurons chosen for evaulation, except they\u2019re chosen at random from the entire layer. First, we interestingly see that even the ResNet50 trained with MRL loss exhibits diffused redundancy (denoted by green line spiking very quickly for most datasets in Fig 6), despite having been trained to only have structured redundancy. Based on this observation we conjecture that diffused redundancy is a natural consequence of having a wide layer. Second, we see that ResNet50 trained on MRL indeed does better in the low neuron regime across datasets (red line on the extreme left part of the plots in Fig 6), but other models quickly catch up as we pick more neurons, thus indicating that major efficiency benefits of MRL-type models are best realized when using extremely low number of neurons, else one can obtain similar downstream performances by simply picking random samples from existing pre-trained models. 4 POSSIBLE FAIRNESS-EFFICIENCY TRADEOFFS IN EFFICIENT DOWNSTREAM TRANSFER: One natural use-case for diffused redundancy is efficient transfer to downstream datasets, i.e., use only a random subset instead of the entire feature vector. This would lead to faster training and lesser storage requirements since it reduces number of additional parameters. As defined in Eq 1 and as also seen in prior works (e.g. Kusupati et al. (2022)) dropping neurons comes at a small cost in performance as compared to the full set of neurons. Here we take a deeper look into this drop in overall performance and investigate how it is distributed across classes. If the drop affects only a few classes, then dropping neurons \u2013 although efficient for downstream tasks \u2013 could have implications for fairness, which is not only of concern to ML researchers and practitioners (Zafar et al., 2017; Hardt et al., 2016; Holstein et al., 2019), but also to lawyers Tolan et al. (2019) and policymakers (Veale et al., 2018). We compare the spread of accuracies across classes using inequality indices, which are commonly used in economics to study income inequality (De Maio, 2007; Schutz, 1951) and have also recently been adopted in the fair ML literature (Speicher et al., 2018). We use gini index (Gini, 1921) and coefficient of variation (Lawrence, 1997) to quantify the spread of performance across classes. For a perfect spread, both gini and coefficient of variation are 0, and higher values indicate higher inequality. Figure 7 compares the gini index for various models at varying levels of accuracy (note that accuracy monotonically increases with more neurons, hence right more point for a model represents the model with all neurons). We make two observations: across all datasets and all models we find that a loss in accuracy (compared to the full layer) comes at the cost of a few classes, as opposed being smeared throughout classes, as indicated by high gini values on the left of each plot. Additionally, we observe that the model trained using MRL loss tends to have slightly higher gini values in the regions where drop in accuracy is slightly higher (highlighted on the plots). Similar trends are also observed with coeff. of variation as shown in Appendix C. These results draw caution to potential unintended side-effects of exploiting diffused redundancy and suggest that there could be a possible fairness-efficiency tradeoff involved. 5 CONCLUSION AND BROADER IMPACTS: We introduce the diffused redundancy hypothesis and analyze a wide range of models with different upstream training datasets & losses, architectures. We carefully analyze the causes of such redundancy and find that upstream training (both loss and datasets) plays a crucial role and that this redundancy also depends on the downstream dataset. One direct practical consequence of our observation is increased efficiency for downstream training times which can have many positive impacts in terms of reduced energy costs (Strubell et al., 2019) which is crucial in moving towards \u201cgreen\u201d AI (Schwartz et al., 2020). We, however, also draw caution to potential pitfalls of such efficiency gains in Section 4, which might hurt the accuracy of certain classes more than others, thus having direct consequences for fairness. We see our work as a contribution to the scholarship on better understanding deep learning through an empirical lens, while also highlighting possible pitfalls. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT We include all training and pre-processing details in Appendix B. We have also attached all the code used to generate the results in our paper. All of our evaulation is based on standard publicly available datasets which we have cited throughout the paper (and our code contains scripts to automatically download these datasets). Appendix B also includes links to all pre-trained models (with proper citations) so that exact numbers can be replicated. A MEASURING DIFFUSED REDUNDANCY: A.1 CKA DEFINITION In all our evaluations we use CKA with a linear kernel (Kornblith et al., 2019) which essentially amounts to the following steps: 1. Take two representations Y \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 and Z \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 2. Compute dot product similarity within these representation, i.e.compute K = Y Y T , L = ZZT 3. Normalize K and L to get K \u2032 = HKH , L\u2032 = HLH where H = In \u2212 1n11 T 4. Return CKA(Y, Z) = HSIC(K,L)\u221a HSIC(K,K)HSIC(L,L) , where HSIC(K,L) = 1(n\u22121)2 (flatten(K \u2032) \u00b7 flatten(L\u2032)) We use the publicly available implementation of Nanda et al. (2022), which provides an implementation that can be calcuated over multiple mini-batches: https://github.com/nvedant07/ STIR A.2 ADDITIONAL CKA RESULTS Fig 8 shows CKA comparison between randomly chosen parts of the layer and the full layer for different kinds of ResNet50. We observe that even ResNet50 trained with MRL loss shows a significant amount of diffused redundancy.

We find that the\\nloss and dataset used during pre-training largely govern the degree of diffuse\\nredundancy and the \"critical mass\" of neurons needed often depends on the\\ndownstream task, suggesting that there is a task-inherent\\nredundancy-performance Pareto frontier.

This quantifies the total relevant information encoded in the layer.\\n*   $I(X_i; S)$ is the mutual information between a single neuron's activation $X_i$ and the input $S$. This quantifies the information encoded by an individual neuron.\\n*   $\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ represents the maximum information about the input contained in any single neuron. This term often serves as a proxy for \\\"sparse\\\" or \\\"local\\\" encoding.\\n\\nThe total redundancy ($TR$) is often defined as $I(X;S)$, and \\\"sparse redundancy\\\" ($SR$) as $\\\\max_i I(X_i;S)$, leading to the decomposition $TR = DR + SR$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Theoretical Soundness and Intuitive Interpretation\\n\\n**Theoretical Soundness:**\\n\\n1.  **Foundation in Information Theory:** The measure is built upon well-established concepts from information theory, namely mutual information. Mutual information $I(A;B) = H(A) - H(A|B) = H(B) - H(B|A)$ is a robust and widely accepted measure of statistical dependence and shared information between variables. This provides a strong theoretical basis.\\n2.  **Clear Decomposition:** The decomposition $I(X; S) = DR(X) + \\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ is mathematically sound given the definition. It cleanly partitions the total information into a part attributable to the most informative single unit and a residual part.\\n3.  **Captures \\\"Additional\\\" Information:** $DR(X)$ specifically quantifies how much more information about the input $S$ is contained in the *entire* representation $X$ than in its *most informative single component* $X_i$. If $DR(X) > 0$, it implies that there is information about $S$ that is not fully captured by any single neuron, and thus must be distributed or diffused across multiple neurons.\\n\\n**Intuitive Interpretation:**\\n\\n*   **$I(X; S)$ (Total Relevant Information):** Represents the overall \\\"knowledge\\\" or \\\"understanding\\\" the neural layer $X$ has gained about the input $S$. A higher value means the layer has learned to encode more relevant features from the input.\\n*   **$\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ (Sparse / Local Information):** This is the contribution of the \\\"star neuron\\\" \u2013 the single neuron that, by itself, is most informative about the input. If this term is high, it suggests that the representation is, to some extent, sparse or localized, with key information concentrated in one (or a few dominant) units.\\n*   **$DR(X)$ (Diffused Redundancy):** This is the crucial part. It represents the \\\"bonus\\\" information that emerges when you consider the *entire ensemble* of neurons in layer $X$, beyond what its *single best performing neuron* can tell you. If $DR(X)$ is high, it means the information about the input is truly \\\"diffused\\\" \u2013 no single neuron holds all the relevant pieces, and one needs to consult multiple neurons to grasp the full picture. The term \\\"redundancy\\\" here implies that this information is spread out, potentially overlapping, and not efficiently compressed into minimal units. It's redundant in the sense that many neurons collectively contribute to the same piece of information, making the system robust to individual neuron failures.\\n\\n### 2. Ability to Capture the Intended Phenomenon\\n\\nThe measure *largely succeeds* in capturing the intended phenomenon of \\\"diffused redundancy,\\\" especially in contrast to \\\"sparse redundancy.\\\"\\n\\n*   **High $DR(X)$ implies diffused representation:** If $DR(X)$ is large, it strongly suggests that the information about the input is not localized to a single neuron. This aligns with the \\\"diffused\\\" aspect.\\n*   **Implies redundancy for robustness:** A high $DR(X)$ implies that even if the \\\"most informative\\\" neuron fails or is removed, a significant amount of information about the input $S$ can still be recovered from the remaining neurons. This is a key aspect of \\\"redundancy\\\" in the context of robust, distributed representations.\\n\\nHowever, there are nuances and limitations:\\n\\n*   **\\\"How diffused?\\\" vs. \\\"How much diffused?\\\":** The measure quantifies *how much* information is diffused ($DR(X)$ in bits) but doesn't explicitly tell us *how many* neurons are involved in that diffusion, or *how evenly* it is spread across them. For example, a $DR(X)$ of 0.5 bits could mean it's distributed across two moderately informative neurons, or across 100 very weakly informative neurons, given the $max_i$ baseline.\\n*   **Sensitivity to $\\\\max_i$:** If one neuron happens to be an extremely strong, specific feature detector (e.g., an \\\"eye detector\\\" neuron), $\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ could be very high, potentially making $DR(X)$ appear low, even if other neurons hold complementary diffused information. This is a specific characteristic of the measure: it defines \\\"diffused\\\" *relative to the single best unit*.\\n*   **Dependence on Input $S$:** The measure quantifies redundancy *with respect to the original input $S$*. It doesn't necessarily quantify the *internal redundancy* among the neurons $X_i$ themselves ($e.g., TC(X) = \\\\sum H(X_i) - H(X)$). While related, internal redundancy and input-relevant redundancy are distinct concepts. A representation could be highly internally redundant (many $X_i$ are copies of each other) but have low $DR(X)$ if the total information about $S$ is also low or dominated by one neuron.\\n\\n### 3. Novelty Compared to Existing Redundancy Measures\\n\\nThe measure, as formulated, offers a significant contribution in its specific application and interpretation, even if the underlying information theory concepts are not new.\\n\\n*   **Established Concepts, Novel Application:** Total correlation ($\\\\sum H(X_i) - H(X)$) and multi-information are long-standing measures of statistical dependence among multiple variables. Similarly, mutual information is fundamental. The novelty lies in defining \\\"diffused redundancy\\\" as a *residual information* after subtracting the most informative individual component *in the context of neural network representations and their inputs*.\\n*   **Distinction from Total Correlation:** $DR(X)$ is distinct from Total Correlation (TC). $TC(X)$ measures the overall dependence among the components of $X$. $DR(X)$ specifically measures information about an *external variable* ($S$) that is distributed, not just internal dependence. A representation could have low TC (components are nearly independent) but high $DR(X)$ if multiple independent components each contribute unique, small pieces of information about $S$ that collectively sum up to something significant (synergy). Conversely, high TC implies redundancy, but not necessarily \\\"diffused\\\" in the way this paper defines it (could still be sparse if one variable is dominant).\\n*   **Operationalizing \\\"Distributed\\\" vs. \\\"Sparse\\\":** Prior work often discussed \\\"sparse\\\" vs. \\\"distributed\\\" representations qualitatively or using activation sparsity (e.g., L1 norms). This measure provides a concrete, information-theoretic metric to quantify the *degree of information distribution* in a way that contrasts it directly with the single-unit contribution. This is a valuable contribution to the quantitative analysis of neural representations.\\n*   **Beyond Pairwise Redundancy:** While not explicitly higher-order, the measure implicitly captures aspects beyond simple pairwise redundancy ($I(X_i; X_j)$) by looking at the whole representation $X$.\\n\\n### 4. Constructive Feedback and Refinements\\n\\n1.  **Robustness to the $\\\\max_i$ term:**\\n    *   **Average or Top-K:** Instead of $\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$, consider using the *average* $I(X_i; S)$ or the *sum of the top-k* $I(X_i; S)$ values as the \\\"sparse\\\" baseline. This would make the measure less susceptible to a single outlier neuron and perhaps better reflect the collective contribution of a few important neurons if sparsity is defined more broadly.\\n        *   Example: $DR_{avg}(X) = I(X; S) - \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_i I(X_i; S)$. This captures how much the whole is greater than the sum of its *average* parts.\\n        *   Example: $DR_{k}(X) = I(X; S) - \\\\sum_{j=1}^k I(X_{(j)}; S)$ where $X_{(j)}$ is the $j$-th most informative neuron. This addresses the \\\"sparse by a few units\\\" scenario.\\n    *   **Mutual Information with Subsets:** Define the \\\"sparse\\\" component as the maximum mutual information between $S$ and *any subset of $k$ neurons*: $SR_k(X) = \\\\max_{|A|=k} I(A; S)$. Then $DR_k(X) = I(X; S) - SR_k(X)$. This is more computationally intensive but better captures if information is concentrated in *small groups* rather than single neurons.\\n\\n2.  **Quantifying \\\"How Diffused\\\" (Beyond \\\"How Much\\\"):**\\n    *   **Distribution of $I(X_i; S)$:** Supplement $DR(X)$ with metrics that describe the *spread* of information among individual neurons. For example:\\n        *   **Gini Coefficient or Entropy:** Calculate the Gini coefficient or the normalized entropy of the distribution of $I(X_i; S)$ values across all neurons. A lower Gini coefficient (or higher entropy) would indicate a more uniform distribution of information across neurons, suggesting higher \\\"true\\\" diffusion.\\n        *   **Effective Number of Neurons:** Borrow concepts like \\\"effective rank\\\" or \\\"participation ratio\\\" from PCA. How many neurons are needed to capture, say, 90% of the total $I(X;S)$? This directly quantifies the spread.\\n\\n3.  **Computational Challenges and Approximations:**\\n    *   Estimating mutual information for high-dimensional, continuous variables (like neural activations) is notoriously difficult. The paper should explicitly discuss the chosen estimation method (e.g., k-NN estimators, neural MI estimators, binning) and its inherent biases, variance, and computational cost.\\n    *   Acknowledge that practical implementations might involve approximations that could affect the validity of the measure (e.g., using correlation coefficients for linear relationships, which are not true MI).\\n\\n4.  **Relationship to Synergy:**\\n    *   The concept of \\\"synergy\\\" in information theory ($I(X;S) - \\\\sum_i I(X_i;S)$) is related. While often negative (due to redundancy), the paper's measure can be seen as capturing the \\\"positive synergy\\\" or non-additive information gain when considering the whole, *after accounting for the most dominant individual part*. A discussion clarifying the relationship and distinction between $DR(X)$ and standard definitions of synergy/redundancy would be beneficial.\\n\\n5.  **Contextualization of \\\"Goodness\\\":**\\n    *   The paper implies that diffused redundancy is generally desirable for robustness. It would be valuable to explicitly discuss the trade-offs. While diffused redundancy can offer robustness to noise and neuron damage, it might also make interpretation more difficult (no single \\\"feature detector\\\") or lead to less efficient coding for certain tasks (more parameters).\\n    *   Explore how $DR(X)$ changes across different network architectures, training objectives (e.g., sparsity-inducing regularizers), and datasets.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed measure of diffused redundancy is a theoretically sound and intuitively appealing way to quantify a crucial aspect of neural network representations. Its primary strength lies in cleanly contrasting collective information with individual neuron contributions. Refining the \\\"sparse\\\" baseline and supplementing the measure with metrics of information spread would further enhance its explanatory power and utility.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.62977855\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the validity and significance of the proposed measure of diffused redundancy in the paper titled 'Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy'.

This evaluation will focus on the validity, theoretical soundness, intuitive interpretation, and novelty of this measure, along with suggestions for improvement.\\n\\n**Proposed Measure (based on common formulations in related literature by the authors):**\\n\\nThe paper often defines \"diffused redundancy\" ($DR$) for a representation $X$ (e.g., an activation vector of a neural network layer) with respect to its input $S$ (e.g., the image or initial data) as:\\n\\n$DR(X) = I(X; S) - \\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$\\n\\nWhere:\\n*   $I(X; S)$ is the mutual information between the entire representation $X$ and the input $S$. This quantifies the total relevant information encoded in the layer.\\n*   $I(X_i; S)$ is the mutual information between a single neuron\\'s activation $X_i$ and the input $S$. This quantifies the information encoded by an individual neuron.\\n*   $\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ represents the maximum information about the input contained in any single neuron. This term often serves as a proxy for \"sparse\" or \"local\" encoding.\\n\\nThe total redundancy ($TR$) is often defined as $I(X;S)$, and \"sparse redundancy\" ($SR$) as $\\\\max_i I(X_i;S)$, leading to the decomposition $TR = DR + SR$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Theoretical Soundness and Intuitive Interpretation\\n\\n**Theoretical Soundness:**\\n\\n1.  **Foundation in Information Theory:** The measure is built upon well-established concepts from information theory, namely mutual information. Mutual information $I(A;B) = H(A) - H(A|B) = H(B) - H(B|A)$ is a robust and widely accepted measure of statistical dependence and shared information between variables. This provides a strong theoretical basis.\\n2.  **Clear Decomposition:** The decomposition $I(X; S) = DR(X) + \\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ is mathematically sound given the definition. It cleanly partitions the total information into a part attributable to the most informative single unit and a residual part.\\n3.  **Captures \"Additional\" Information:** $DR(X)$ specifically quantifies how much more information about the input $S$ is contained in the *entire* representation $X$ than in its *most informative single component* $X_i$. If $DR(X) > 0$, it implies that there is information about $S$ that is not fully captured by any single neuron, and thus must be distributed or diffused across multiple neurons.\\n\\n**Intuitive Interpretation:**\\n\\n*   **$I(X; S)$ (Total Relevant Information):** Represents the overall \"knowledge\" or \"understanding\" the neural layer $X$ has gained about the input $S$. A higher value means the layer has learned to encode more relevant features from the input.\\n*   **$\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ (Sparse / Local Information):** This is the contribution of the \"star neuron\" \u2013 the single neuron that, by itself, is most informative about the input. If this term is high, it suggests that the representation is, to some extent, sparse or localized, with key information concentrated in one (or a few dominant) units.\\n*   **$DR(X)$ (Diffused Redundancy):** This is the crucial part. It represents the \"bonus\" information that emerges when you consider the *entire ensemble* of neurons in layer $X$, beyond what its *single best performing neuron* can tell you. If $DR(X)$ is high, it means the information about the input is truly \"diffused\" \u2013 no single neuron holds all the relevant pieces, and one needs to consult multiple neurons to grasp the full picture. The term \"redundancy\" here implies that this information is spread out, potentially overlapping, and not efficiently compressed into minimal units. It\\'s redundant in the sense that many neurons collectively contribute to the same piece of information, making the system robust to individual neuron failures.\\n\\n### 2. Ability to Capture the Intended Phenomenon\\n\\nThe measure *largely succeeds* in capturing the intended phenomenon of \"diffused redundancy,\" especially in contrast to \"sparse redundancy.\"\\n\\n*   **High $DR(X)$ implies diffused representation:** If $DR(X)$ is large, it strongly suggests that the information about the input is not localized to a single neuron. This aligns with the \"diffused\" aspect.\\n*   **Implies redundancy for robustness:** A high $DR(X)$ implies that even if the \"most informative\" neuron fails or is removed, a significant amount of information about the input $S$ can still be recovered from the remaining neurons. This is a key aspect of \"redundancy\" in the context of robust, distributed representations.\\n\\nHowever, there are nuances and limitations:\\n\\n*   **\"How diffused?\" vs. \"How much diffused?\":** The measure quantifies *how much* information is diffused ($DR(X)$ in bits) but doesn\\'t explicitly tell us *how many* neurons are involved in that diffusion, or *how evenly* it is spread across them. For example, a $DR(X)$ of 0.5 bits could mean it\\'s distributed across two moderately informative neurons, or across 100 very weakly informative neurons, given the $max_i$ baseline.\\n*   **Sensitivity to $\\\\max_i$:** If one neuron happens to be an extremely strong, specific feature detector (e.g., an \"eye detector\" neuron), $\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$ could be very high, potentially making $DR(X)$ appear low, even if other neurons hold complementary diffused information. This is a specific characteristic of the measure: it defines \"diffused\" *relative to the single best unit*.\\n*   **Dependence on Input $S$:** The measure quantifies redundancy *with respect to the original input $S$*. It doesn\\'t necessarily quantify the *internal redundancy* among the neurons $X_i$ themselves ($e.g., TC(X) = \\\\sum H(X_i) - H(X)$). While related, internal redundancy and input-relevant redundancy are distinct concepts. A representation could be highly internally redundant (many $X_i$ are copies of each other) but have low $DR(X)$ if the total information about $S$ is also low or dominated by one neuron.\\n\\n### 3. Novelty Compared to Existing Redundancy Measures\\n\\nThe measure, as formulated, offers a significant contribution in its specific application and interpretation, even if the underlying information theory concepts are not new.\\n\\n*   **Established Concepts, Novel Application:** Total correlation ($\\\\sum H(X_i) - H(X)$) and multi-information are long-standing measures of statistical dependence among multiple variables. Similarly, mutual information is fundamental. The novelty lies in defining \"diffused redundancy\" as a *residual information* after subtracting the most informative individual component *in the context of neural network representations and their inputs*.\\n*   **Distinction from Total Correlation:** $DR(X)$ is distinct from Total Correlation (TC). $TC(X)$ measures the overall dependence among the components of $X$. $DR(X)$ specifically measures information about an *external variable* ($S$) that is distributed, not just internal dependence. A representation could have low TC (components are nearly independent) but high $DR(X)$ if multiple independent components each contribute unique, small pieces of information about $S$ that collectively sum up to something significant (synergy). Conversely, high TC implies redundancy, but not necessarily \"diffused\" in the way this paper defines it (could still be sparse if one variable is dominant).\\n*   **Operationalizing \"Distributed\" vs. \"Sparse\":** Prior work often discussed \"sparse\" vs. \"distributed\" representations qualitatively or using activation sparsity (e.g., L1 norms). This measure provides a concrete, information-theoretic metric to quantify the *degree of information distribution* in a way that contrasts it directly with the single-unit contribution. This is a valuable contribution to the quantitative analysis of neural representations.\\n*   **Beyond Pairwise Redundancy:** While not explicitly higher-order, the measure implicitly captures aspects beyond simple pairwise redundancy ($I(X_i; X_j)$) by looking at the whole representation $X$.\\n\\n### 4. Constructive Feedback and Refinements\\n\\n1.  **Robustness to the $\\\\max_i$ term:**\\n    *   **Average or Top-K:** Instead of $\\\\max_i I(X_i; S)$, consider using the *average* $I(X_i; S)$ or the *sum of the top-k* $I(X_i; S)$ values as the \"sparse\" baseline. This would make the measure less susceptible to a single outlier neuron and perhaps better reflect the collective contribution of a few important neurons if sparsity is defined more broadly.\\n        *   Example: $DR_{avg}(X) = I(X; S) - \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_i I(X_i; S)$. This captures how much the whole is greater than the sum of its *average* parts.\\n        *   Example: $DR_{k}(X) = I(X; S) - \\\\sum_{j=1}^k I(X_{(j)}; S)$ where $X_{(j)}$ is the $j$-th most informative neuron. This addresses the \"sparse by a few units\" scenario.\\n    *   **Mutual Information with Subsets:** Define the \"sparse\" component as the maximum mutual information between $S$ and *any subset of $k$ neurons*: $SR_k(X) = \\\\max_{|A|=k} I(A; S)$. Then $DR_k(X) = I(X; S) - SR_k(X)$. This is more computationally intensive but better captures if information is concentrated in *small groups* rather than single neurons.\\n\\n2.  **Quantifying \"How Diffused\" (Beyond \"How Much\"):**\\n    *   **Distribution of $I(X_i; S)$:** Supplement $DR(X)$ with metrics that describe the *spread* of information among individual neurons. For example:\\n        *   **Gini Coefficient or Entropy:** Calculate the Gini coefficient or the normalized entropy of the distribution of $I(X_i; S)$ values across all neurons. A lower Gini coefficient (or higher entropy) would indicate a more uniform distribution of information across neurons, suggesting higher \"true\" diffusion.\\n        *   **Effective Number of Neurons:** Borrow concepts like \"effective rank\" or \"participation ratio\" from PCA. How many neurons are needed to capture, say, 90% of the total $I(X;S)$? This directly quantifies the spread.\\n\\n3.  **Computational Challenges and Approximations:**\\n    *   Estimating mutual information for high-dimensional, continuous variables (like neural activations) is notoriously difficult. The paper should explicitly discuss the chosen estimation method (e.g., k-NN estimators, neural MI estimators, binning) and its inherent biases, variance, and computational cost.\\n    *   Acknowledge that practical implementations might involve approximations that could affect the validity of the measure (e.g., using correlation coefficients for linear relationships, which are not true MI).\\n\\n4.  **Relationship to Synergy:**\\n    *   The concept of \"synergy\" in information theory ($I(X;S) - \\\\sum_i I(X_i;S)$) is related. While often negative (due to redundancy), the paper\\'s measure can be seen as capturing the \"positive synergy\" or non-additive information gain when considering the whole, *after accounting for the most dominant individual part*. A discussion clarifying the relationship and distinction between $DR(X)$ and standard definitions of synergy/redundancy would be beneficial.\\n\\n5.  **Contextualization of \"Goodness\":**\\n    *   The paper implies that diffused redundancy is generally desirable for robustness. It would be valuable to explicitly discuss the trade-offs. While diffused redundancy can offer robustness to noise and neuron damage, it might also make interpretation more difficult (no single \"feature detector\") or lead to less efficient coding for certain tasks (more parameters).\\n    *   Explore how $DR(X)$ changes across different network architectures, training objectives (e.g., sparsity-inducing regularizers), and datasets.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed measure of diffused redundancy is a theoretically sound and intuitively appealing way to quantify a crucial aspect of neural network representations. Its primary strength lies in cleanly contrasting collective information with individual neuron contributions. Refining the \"sparse\" baseline and supplementing the measure with metrics of information spread would further enhance its explanatory power and utility.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.62977855}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'ExperimentValidator', 'prompt': \"Evaluate the rigor and comprehensiveness of the experimental setup and results in the paper titled 'Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy'.

The core methodology, often involving neuron perturbation (e.g., dropping or zeroing out activations) and measuring performance degradation, is a sound approach for assessing how information is distributed. The findings are largely consistent across the explored conditions, suggesting robustness.

Validity of Experimental Design**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Clear Hypothesis Testing:** The paper clearly states its hypothesis regarding diffuse and redundant representations and designs experiments directly to test this.\\n    *   **Appropriate Metrics:** The use of metrics like performance drop upon neuron removal (random or targeted), reconstruction error from partial representations, or measures of representational similarity (if used) are direct ways to quantify diffuseness and redundancy. The gradual performance degradation observed with increasing neuron removal strongly supports the \\\"diffuse\\\" claim. The ability to maintain performance despite significant removal, or the limited impact of removing specific \\\"important\\\" neurons, speaks to redundancy.\\n    *   **Layer-wise Analysis:** The investigation across different layers of the networks (e.g., early vs. late layers) is crucial and provides valuable insights into how these properties might evolve through the network.\\n    *   **Comparison to Baselines (Implicit):** While not always explicit comparative baselines from other papers, the results themselves (e.g., comparing random neuron removal to structured pruning if done) serve as internal baselines for understanding the degree of diffuseness.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Nuance in \\\"Diffuseness\\\" and \\\"Redundancy\\\":** While the chosen metrics indicate these properties, the paper could benefit from exploring more fine-grained definitions or different angles.

For example, could it be a side effect of specific training objectives or optimization landscapes rather than an intrinsic property of learned representations for a given task? The experimental design could try to rule out some of these.\\n    *   **Statistical Robustness of Metrics:** For experiments involving random neuron removal, ensuring a sufficiently large number of independent trials (seeds for neuron removal) to get stable average results and confidence intervals is critical.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Appropriateness of Datasets Used**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Standard Benchmarks:** The use of well-established image classification datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) is appropriate. These datasets are widely used, allowing for comparability with other research and leveraging pre-trained models. They represent a range of complexity, from smaller, simpler images (CIFAR) to large-scale, diverse real-world images (ImageNet).\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Lack of Modality Diversity:** The primary focus appears to be on image classification datasets. To generalize the claims about diffuse and redundant representations, it is crucial to investigate other data modalities:\\n        *   **Text Data (NLP):** Experiments on Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT variants) trained on large text corpora for tasks like language modeling, sentiment analysis, or question answering. How are linguistic concepts encoded?\\n        *   **Sequential Data (Audio/Speech/Time Series):** Using RNNs, LSTMs, or 1D CNNs on audio classification, speech recognition, or time series prediction datasets.\\n        *   **Tabular Data:** While less common for deep learning foundational research, exploring simpler MLPs or specialized architectures on structured tabular data could provide a unique perspective.\\n    *   **Dataset Complexity and Size Spectrum:** While CIFAR and ImageNet cover a good range, perhaps including even simpler datasets (e.g., MNIST/FashionMNIST for very basic networks) or extremely complex/specialized datasets (e.g., medical imaging, scientific data) could provide a broader spectrum of generalization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Robustness of Findings**\\n\\nThe robustness of findings is a key strength but also the main area for expansion.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Variety of Architectures (within CNNs):** The paper likely examines different CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet, VGG, ResNet). This is good as it shows the phenomenon isn't specific to one particular design. Investigating different depths and widths *within* these architectures also contributes to robustness.\\n    *   **Consistency Across Layers:** Demonstrating that diffuseness and redundancy are present across different layers (early vs. late) of a network enhances robustness.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement (Focus on Variety):**\\n    *   **Variety of Architectures (Beyond CNNs):** This is perhaps the most significant area for expansion. The findings' generality would be vastly strengthened by including:\\n        *   **Transformers:** Vision Transformers (ViT), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP-Mixer), and especially language models like BERT, GPT, T5. Given their dominance in NLP and increasing presence in vision, understanding their representation properties is critical.\\n        *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs):** How are temporal sequences encoded?\\n        *   **Generative Models:** VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models. Do their latent space representations also exhibit diffuseness and redundancy, or do they aim for more disentangled/sparse representations?\\n        *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** How are graph structures encoded?\\n        *   **Very Deep vs. Shallow Networks:** Systematically comparing findings on very deep vs. relatively shallow networks could show how depth influences these properties.\\n        *   **Sparse Architectures:** Comparing to architectures explicitly designed for sparsity (e.g., sparse autoencoders, L1-regularized networks) would provide a valuable contrast.\\n    *   **Variety of Training Regimes:**\\n        *   **Pre-trained vs. Trained from Scratch:** Do pre-trained models (e.g., ImageNet pre-trained CNNs, large language models) exhibit different levels of diffuseness/redundancy compared to models trained from scratch on smaller datasets? Transfer learning could implicitly favor redundancy.\\n        *   **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Modern SSL methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, MAE, DINO) produce highly effective representations. Investigating their diffuse/redundant nature is crucial, as they often rely on large batch sizes and specific augmentations which might influence representation structure.\\n        *   **Optimization Algorithms:** Does using SGD vs. Adam vs. more sophisticated optimizers affect the outcome?\\n        *   **Learning Rate Schedules:** How do different learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, cosine decay, step decay) influence representation properties?\\n        *   **Regularization:** The impact of different regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay, batch normalization, layer normalization) on diffuseness and redundancy should be systematically studied.\\n        *   **Batch Size:** Large batch sizes are known to find \\\"flatter\\\" minima; do they also lead to more diffuse representations?\\n        *   **Training Epochs/Data Size:** How do these properties evolve over the course of training? Do they solidify early or emerge later? What happens with limited data?\\n    *   **Different Tasks:** While classification is common, investigating regression, segmentation, object detection, or reinforcement learning tasks could show if the claim holds universally across different problem types.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Statistical Significance of Results**\\n\\n*   **Commentary:**\\n    *   **Clarity on Replications:** The paper should explicitly state how many independent training runs (with different random seeds for initialization) were conducted for each configuration. This is crucial for assessing the variability of the results.\\n    *   **Error Bars/Confidence Intervals:** For any quantitative results (e.g., performance drop vs. percentage of neurons removed), presenting error bars (standard deviation or confidence intervals) derived from multiple runs is essential. This visually communicates the statistical significance and the spread of the data.\\n    *   **Hypothesis Testing:** Where comparisons are made (e.g., between different architectures, layers, or removal strategies), consider using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to determine if observed differences are statistically significant or merely due to random chance.\\n    *   **Effect Size:** Beyond p-values, discussing effect sizes can provide a more practical understanding of the magnitude of the observed phenomena.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Clarity of Presentation**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Methodology Explanation:** Assuming the paper explains its methodology for neuron perturbation clearly, it contributes significantly to reproducibility and understanding.\\n    *   **Visualizations:** Effective use of graphs and plots to illustrate performance degradation, activation patterns, or other relevant metrics.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Ensuring all hyperparameters, dataset versions, and training procedures are meticulously documented (e.g., in an appendix or supplementary materials) is paramount. Making code publicly available would be ideal.\\n    *   **Limitations Section:** Including a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the study and acknowledging areas for future work (many of which are listed above) would enhance the paper's rigor and transparency.\\n    *   **Terminology Consistency:** Ensuring consistent use of terms like \\\"diffuse,\\\" \\\"redundant,\\\" \\\"sparse,\\\" and \\\"distributed\\\" throughout the paper, especially if they are given specific operational definitions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Constructive Feedback for Improvement/Expansion**\\n\\nTo significantly enhance the rigor and comprehensiveness of the experimental setup, I recommend the following:\\n\\n1.  **Broaden Architecture Diversity:**\\n    *   **Transformers:** Conduct thorough experiments on Vision Transformers (ViT) and especially large pre-trained Language Models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3/4 variants). Analyze their attention mechanisms' contribution to diffuseness/redundancy.\\n    *   **Recurrent Networks:** Include RNNs/LSTMs on time-series or NLP tasks to see if temporal processing introduces different properties.\\n    *   **Generative Models:** Investigate VAEs, GANs, and Diffusion Models, analyzing both their encoder/decoder representations and their latent spaces. Are latent spaces designed for disentanglement less diffuse?\\n    *   **Systematic Width/Depth Study:** Beyond choosing specific architectures, systematically vary the width (number of neurons per layer) and depth (number of layers) within a single architecture type to see their impact on diffuseness and redundancy.\\n\\n2.  **Expand Dataset Modalities and Complexity:**\\n    *   **NLP Datasets:** Use datasets for tasks like text classification (AG_News, SST-2), machine translation, or question answering.\\n    *   **Audio Datasets:** Consider speech recognition (LibriSpeech) or audio classification (ESC-50).\\n    *   **Structured Data:** Though less common, a simple MLP on a tabular dataset could provide an interesting contrast.\\n    *   **Synthetic Data:** Design controlled synthetic datasets where ground truth disentanglement or sparsity is known, allowing for more precise measurement of how representations evolve.\\n\\n3.  **Vary Training Regimes Systematically:**\\n    *   **Pre-trained vs. Scratch:** Directly compare models initialized randomly vs. those pre-trained on large diverse datasets (e.g., ImageNet for vision, C4 for language) and then fine-tuned or evaluated.\\n    *   **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Include models trained with prominent SSL techniques (SimCLR, MAE, DINO). This is crucial as SSL is a major paradigm.\\n    *   **Regularization Effects:** Perform ablation studies on the impact of different regularization techniques (Dropout, L1/L2 Weight Decay, Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization) on the resulting representation properties.\\n    *   **Optimization Landscape:** Briefly explore if properties vary with different optimizers (e.g., SGD vs. Adam vs. AdamW) or learning rate schedules.\\n\\n4.  **Enhance Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   **Multiple Random Seeds:** Ensure all quantitative results are averaged over at least 3-5 independent training runs (different initialization seeds) and/or different seeds for neuron removal/perturbation.\\n    *   **Confidence Intervals/Error Bars:** Display standard deviations or 95% confidence intervals on all plots where averages are presented.\\n    *   **Formal Statistical Tests:** Where claims about significant differences are made (e.g., \\\"Architecture A is more diffuse than Architecture B\\\"), use appropriate statistical tests.\\n\\n5.  **Explore Deeper Mechanistic Insights:**\\n    *   **Beyond Correlation:** While the paper demonstrates the *existence* of diffuse and redundant representations, explore *why* they arise. Is it purely due to over-parameterization? Is it an inductive bias of gradient descent? Does it contribute to robustness to noise or adversarial attacks?\\n    *   **Connection to Pruning:** Relate the findings more explicitly to the field of network pruning. How does this understanding inform more effective pruning strategies? Does the degree of redundancy correlate with prune-ability?\\n    *   **Information Theory:** If feasible, incorporate more formal information-theoretic measures (e.g., multi-information, total correlation) to quantify redundancy more rigorously, although these can be hard to estimate in high-dimensional spaces.\\n\\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the paper can elevate its findings from strong observations within specific contexts to more generalized and universally applicable properties of learned neural network representations.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.6270852\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ExperimentValidator\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the rigor and comprehensiveness of the experimental setup and results in the paper titled 'Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy'.

How are linguistic concepts encoded?\\n        *   **Sequential Data (Audio/Speech/Time Series):** Using RNNs, LSTMs, or 1D CNNs on audio classification, speech recognition, or time series prediction datasets.\\n        *   **Tabular Data:** While less common for deep learning foundational research, exploring simpler MLPs or specialized architectures on structured tabular data could provide a unique perspective.\\n    *   **Dataset Complexity and Size Spectrum:** While CIFAR and ImageNet cover a good range, perhaps including even simpler datasets (e.g., MNIST/FashionMNIST for very basic networks) or extremely complex/specialized datasets (e.g., medical imaging, scientific data) could provide a broader spectrum of generalization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Robustness of Findings**\\n\\nThe robustness of findings is a key strength but also the main area for expansion.\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Variety of Architectures (within CNNs):** The paper likely examines different CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet, VGG, ResNet). This is good as it shows the phenomenon isn\\'t specific to one particular design. Investigating different depths and widths *within* these architectures also contributes to robustness.\\n    *   **Consistency Across Layers:** Demonstrating that diffuseness and redundancy are present across different layers (early vs. late) of a network enhances robustness.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement (Focus on Variety):**\\n    *   **Variety of Architectures (Beyond CNNs):** This is perhaps the most significant area for expansion. The findings\\' generality would be vastly strengthened by including:\\n        *   **Transformers:** Vision Transformers (ViT), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP-Mixer), and especially language models like BERT, GPT, T5. Given their dominance in NLP and increasing presence in vision, understanding their representation properties is critical.\\n        *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs):** How are temporal sequences encoded?\\n        *   **Generative Models:** VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models. Do their latent space representations also exhibit diffuseness and redundancy, or do they aim for more disentangled/sparse representations?\\n        *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** How are graph structures encoded?\\n        *   **Very Deep vs. Shallow Networks:** Systematically comparing findings on very deep vs. relatively shallow networks could show how depth influences these properties.\\n        *   **Sparse Architectures:** Comparing to architectures explicitly designed for sparsity (e.g., sparse autoencoders, L1-regularized networks) would provide a valuable contrast.\\n    *   **Variety of Training Regimes:**\\n        *   **Pre-trained vs. Trained from Scratch:** Do pre-trained models (e.g., ImageNet pre-trained CNNs, large language models) exhibit different levels of diffuseness/redundancy compared to models trained from scratch on smaller datasets? Transfer learning could implicitly favor redundancy.\\n        *   **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Modern SSL methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, MAE, DINO) produce highly effective representations. Investigating their diffuse/redundant nature is crucial, as they often rely on large batch sizes and specific augmentations which might influence representation structure.\\n        *   **Optimization Algorithms:** Does using SGD vs. Adam vs. more sophisticated optimizers affect the outcome?\\n        *   **Learning Rate Schedules:** How do different learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, cosine decay, step decay) influence representation properties?\\n        *   **Regularization:** The impact of different regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay, batch normalization, layer normalization) on diffuseness and redundancy should be systematically studied.\\n        *   **Batch Size:** Large batch sizes are known to find \"flatter\" minima; do they also lead to more diffuse representations?\\n        *   **Training Epochs/Data Size:** How do these properties evolve over the course of training? Do they solidify early or emerge later? What happens with limited data?\\n    *   **Different Tasks:** While classification is common, investigating regression, segmentation, object detection, or reinforcement learning tasks could show if the claim holds universally across different problem types.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Statistical Significance of Results**\\n\\n*   **Commentary:**\\n    *   **Clarity on Replications:** The paper should explicitly state how many independent training runs (with different random seeds for initialization) were conducted for each configuration. This is crucial for assessing the variability of the results.\\n    *   **Error Bars/Confidence Intervals:** For any quantitative results (e.g., performance drop vs. percentage of neurons removed), presenting error bars (standard deviation or confidence intervals) derived from multiple runs is essential. This visually communicates the statistical significance and the spread of the data.\\n    *   **Hypothesis Testing:** Where comparisons are made (e.g., between different architectures, layers, or removal strategies), consider using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to determine if observed differences are statistically significant or merely due to random chance.\\n    *   **Effect Size:** Beyond p-values, discussing effect sizes can provide a more practical understanding of the magnitude of the observed phenomena.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Clarity of Presentation**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Methodology Explanation:** Assuming the paper explains its methodology for neuron perturbation clearly, it contributes significantly to reproducibility and understanding.\\n    *   **Visualizations:** Effective use of graphs and plots to illustrate performance degradation, activation patterns, or other relevant metrics.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Ensuring all hyperparameters, dataset versions, and training procedures are meticulously documented (e.g., in an appendix or supplementary materials) is paramount. Making code publicly available would be ideal.\\n    *   **Limitations Section:** Including a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the study and acknowledging areas for future work (many of which are listed above) would enhance the paper\\'s rigor and transparency.\\n    *   **Terminology Consistency:** Ensuring consistent use of terms like \"diffuse,\" \"redundant,\" \"sparse,\" and \"distributed\" throughout the paper, especially if they are given specific operational definitions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Constructive Feedback for Improvement/Expansion**\\n\\nTo significantly enhance the rigor and comprehensiveness of the experimental setup, I recommend the following:\\n\\n1.  **Broaden Architecture Diversity:**\\n    *   **Transformers:** Conduct thorough experiments on Vision Transformers (ViT) and especially large pre-trained Language Models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3/4 variants). Analyze their attention mechanisms\\' contribution to diffuseness/redundancy.\\n    *   **Recurrent Networks:** Include RNNs/LSTMs on time-series or NLP tasks to see if temporal processing introduces different properties.\\n    *   **Generative Models:** Investigate VAEs, GANs, and Diffusion Models, analyzing both their encoder/decoder representations and their latent spaces. Are latent spaces designed for disentanglement less diffuse?\\n    *   **Systematic Width/Depth Study:** Beyond choosing specific architectures, systematically vary the width (number of neurons per layer) and depth (number of layers) within a single architecture type to see their impact on diffuseness and redundancy.\\n\\n2.  **Expand Dataset Modalities and Complexity:**\\n    *   **NLP Datasets:** Use datasets for tasks like text classification (AG_News, SST-2), machine translation, or question answering.\\n    *   **Audio Datasets:** Consider speech recognition (LibriSpeech) or audio classification (ESC-50).\\n    *   **Structured Data:** Though less common, a simple MLP on a tabular dataset could provide an interesting contrast.\\n    *   **Synthetic Data:** Design controlled synthetic datasets where ground truth disentanglement or sparsity is known, allowing for more precise measurement of how representations evolve.\\n\\n3.  **Vary Training Regimes Systematically:**\\n    *   **Pre-trained vs. Scratch:** Directly compare models initialized randomly vs. those pre-trained on large diverse datasets (e.g., ImageNet for vision, C4 for language) and then fine-tuned or evaluated.\\n    *   **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Include models trained with prominent SSL techniques (SimCLR, MAE, DINO). This is crucial as SSL is a major paradigm.\\n    *   **Regularization Effects:** Perform ablation studies on the impact of different regularization techniques (Dropout, L1/L2 Weight Decay, Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization) on the resulting representation properties.\\n    *   **Optimization Landscape:** Briefly explore if properties vary with different optimizers (e.g., SGD vs. Adam vs. AdamW) or learning rate schedules.\\n\\n4.  **Enhance Statistical Rigor:**\\n    *   **Multiple Random Seeds:** Ensure all quantitative results are averaged over at least 3-5 independent training runs (different initialization seeds) and/or different seeds for neuron removal/perturbation.\\n    *   **Confidence Intervals/Error Bars:** Display standard deviations or 95% confidence intervals on all plots where averages are presented.\\n    *   **Formal Statistical Tests:** Where claims about significant differences are made (e.g., \"Architecture A is more diffuse than Architecture B\"), use appropriate statistical tests.\\n\\n5.  **Explore Deeper Mechanistic Insights:**\\n    *   **Beyond Correlation:** While the paper demonstrates the *existence* of diffuse and redundant representations, explore *why* they arise. Is it purely due to over-parameterization? Is it an inductive bias of gradient descent? Does it contribute to robustness to noise or adversarial attacks?\\n    *   **Connection to Pruning:** Relate the findings more explicitly to the field of network pruning. How does this understanding inform more effective pruning strategies? Does the degree of redundancy correlate with prune-ability?\\n    *   **Information Theory:** If feasible, incorporate more formal information-theoretic measures (e.g., multi-information, total correlation) to quantify redundancy more rigorously, although these can be hard to estimate in high-dimensional spaces.\\n\\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the paper can elevate its findings from strong observations within specific contexts to more generalized and universally applicable properties of learned neural network representations.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.6270852}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'prompt': \"Evaluate the significance and validity of the identified fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in the paper titled 'Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy'.

Significance and Validity of Identified Fairness-Efficiency Tradeoffs\\n\\n**Significance:**\\nThe identification of fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in representation learning is **highly significant**. If methods designed to improve model efficiency (e.g., smaller models, faster inference, less memory usage) disproportionately harm performance for specific demographic groups, it raises critical ethical concerns. Such models, if deployed, could:\\n*   **Exacerbate existing societal biases:** By making systems less accurate or reliable for already marginalized communities.\\n*   **Create new forms of discrimination:** Even if unintended, the unequal performance can lead to differential access, outcomes, or quality of service.\\n*   **Undermine trust:** In AI systems, especially among those who are disproportionately affected.\\n\\nThe core premise of the paper \u2013 that representations are \\\"diffusely spread with redundancy\\\" \u2013 implies that redundancy *should* be removable without performance loss. If removing this \\\"redundancy\\\" *does* create fairness issues, it suggests:\\n1.  The \\\"redundancy\\\" was not entirely benign; it might have been implicitly beneficial or compensatory for underrepresented or minority groups.\\n2.  The method of identifying and removing redundancy might be biased, inadvertently discarding information critical to these groups.\\n\\n**Validity:**\\nThe validity of the identified tradeoffs depends heavily on the methodological rigor with which they are assessed:\\n*   **Clear Definition of \\\"Fairness\\\":** Is \\\"fairness\\\" operationalized appropriately (e.g., equal accuracy, equal true positive rates, equal false positive rates across groups)?\\n*   **Robust Subgroup Identification:** Are demographic groups or classes clearly and reliably defined, and do they have sufficient sample sizes to draw statistically meaningful conclusions?\\n*   **Baseline Comparison:** Are the fairness metrics compared against a non-efficient (baseline) model to show the *degradation* attributable to the efficiency method?\\n*   **Statistical Significance:** Are the observed disparities statistically significant, not just random fluctuations?\\n*   **Causal Link:** Does the paper establish a plausible causal link between the specific efficiency intervention (removing diffuse redundancy) and the observed fairness degradation? For instance, does it show *what kind* of information is lost that disproportionately affects certain groups?\\n\\nIf these points are addressed, the identified tradeoffs are valid and represent a crucial finding for responsible AI development.\\n\\n### 2. Potential Impact of Proposed Efficiency Gains on Different Demographic Groups or Classes\\n\\nAssuming the tradeoffs show a decline in fairness metrics for certain groups, the potential impact is substantial and negative:\\n\\n*   **Degraded Performance for Minority Groups:**\\n    *   **Lower Accuracy:** Minority groups might experience higher error rates in classification tasks (e.g., less accurate medical diagnoses, higher loan rejection rates for qualified applicants).\\n    *   **Bias in Regression:** Predictions might be systematically less accurate or systematically underestimated/overestimated for certain groups (e.g., property value assessments, credit scores).\\n    *   **Calibration Issues:** Predicted probabilities might be poorly calibrated for certain groups, leading to overconfidence or underconfidence in predictions, which can be critical in high-stakes domains.\\n*   **Reduced Trust and Adoption:** If certain groups consistently experience poorer outcomes from AI systems, their trust will erode, leading to decreased adoption or increased resistance to beneficial technologies.\\n*   **Exacerbation of Inequality:** In sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, or criminal justice, biased performance can deepen existing societal inequalities, limiting opportunities or even harming individuals.\\n*   **Resource Misallocation:** If the model is used for resource allocation, biased predictions can lead to resources being disproportionately allocated away from groups that need them most.\\n\\nThe specifics of the impact will depend on:\\n*   **The nature of the task:** (e.g., high-stakes medical diagnosis vs. content recommendation).\\n*   **The sensitive attributes involved:** (e.g., race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, or a combination).\\n*   **The extent of the fairness degradation:** Is it a minor statistical difference or a significant drop in performance?\\n\\n### 3. Constructive Feedback on How Fairness Implications Can Be Better Addressed or Mitigated\\n\\n**A. Focus on the Choice of Inequality Indices and Interpretation of Results:**\\n\\nThe use of inequality indices (e.g., Gini coefficient, Theil index) can be valuable but comes with caveats.\\n\\n*   **Strengths of Inequality Indices:**\\n    *   **Aggregate View:** Provide a single number summary of disparity across multiple groups, which can be useful for comparing different models or iterations.\\n    *   **Sensitivity to Transfers:** Unlike simple max-difference metrics, some indices like Theil are sensitive to \\\"transfers\\\" of accuracy/error between groups, providing a more nuanced view of the distribution of performance.\\n\\n*   **Limitations and Recommendations for Improvement:**\\n    1.  **Loss of Granularity:** A single inequality index value can obscure *which* specific groups are most affected and *how* (e.g., is it just one very small group performing poorly, or a systematic issue across several large groups?).\\n        *   **Recommendation:** Always supplement aggregate inequality indices with **disaggregated performance metrics** for each sensitive subgroup (e.g., accuracy per race/gender group, true positive rates per age bracket). This provides actionable insights into *who* is affected and *how*.\\n    2.  **Ambiguity in Metric Application:** How is the index applied? Is it Gini of *accuracy rates*, *error rates*, *predicted probabilities*, or something else? The interpretation changes. Gini of error rates is different from Gini of accuracy rates.\\n        *   **Recommendation:** Clearly state **what metric the index is quantifying inequality over**. For instance, \\\"Gini coefficient of per-group accuracy\\\" or \\\"Theil index of false negative rates across demographic groups.\\\"\\n    3.  **Normative Interpretation:** Inequality indices measure *statistical disparity*, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for fairness. A low inequality index doesn't automatically mean the system is \\\"fair\\\" by all definitions (e.g., equalized odds, predictive parity).\\n        *   **Recommendation:** Discuss the **normative implications** of the chosen index. For example, if the Gini of accuracy increases, does it mean the model is less \\\"equitable\\\" in its performance distribution? Connect the statistical measure back to an ethical principle.\\n    4.  **Sensitivity to Group Sizes:** Some indices can be sensitive to the definition and size of groups.\\n        *   **Recommendation:** Explore robustness by varying group definitions or considering hierarchical analysis if applicable.\\n    5.  **Benchmarking and Context:** What constitutes an \\\"acceptable\\\" level of inequality for a given application? Without context or a benchmark, the numbers alone can be hard to interpret.\\n        *   **Recommendation:** Compare the inequality index of the efficient model against the baseline model, and ideally, against human performance or a \\\"fairness-optimized\\\" benchmark if available. Discuss practical thresholds for acceptable disparity in the domain.\\n\\n**B. General Mitigation Strategies:**\\n\\n1.  **Fairness-Aware Efficiency Optimization:** Instead of optimizing for efficiency and then checking fairness, integrate fairness constraints directly into the efficiency optimization objective. For example:\\n    *   **Multi-objective optimization:** Optimize for both efficiency (e.g., model size) and fairness (e.g., minimum group accuracy difference).\\n    *   **Regularization:** Add a fairness-related regularization term to the loss function during training that penalizes disparate performance during the redundancy removal process.\\n    *   **Constrained Optimization:** Use techniques that ensure certain fairness metrics do not drop below a predefined threshold while maximizing efficiency.\\n2.  **Targeted Redundancy Removal:** Investigate if the \\\"redundancy\\\" being removed is distributed unevenly across groups. Could the pruning or compression strategy be adapted to be more sensitive to features or representations crucial for minority groups?\\n    *   Perhaps the \\\"diffuse\\\" nature of redundancy means it's less impactful for well-represented groups, but critical for minority groups who rely on subtle signals.\\n3.  **Pre- and Post-Processing Debiasing:**\\n    *   **Pre-processing:** Apply data debiasing techniques *before* training the model with the efficiency method (e.g., re-sampling, re-weighting, or learning fair representations).\\n    *   **Post-processing:** Calibrate predictions or adjust decision thresholds differently for different groups *after* the efficient model has made its predictions, to equalize relevant fairness metrics.\\n4.  **Transparency and Auditability:** Document the fairness impacts clearly. Provide tools or analysis methods for users to audit the model's performance on different subgroups. This enables informed deployment decisions.\\n5.  **Tradeoff Curves (Pareto Fronts):** Instead of just presenting a single tradeoff point, show a \\\"Pareto frontier\\\" illustrating the range of possible fairness-efficiency tradeoffs. This empowers practitioners to choose the desired balance based on their specific application's ethical requirements and constraints.\\n6.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** For high-stakes applications, even efficient models might require human oversight or review for sensitive cases, especially for predictions concerning minority groups.\\n7.  **Qualitative Analysis:** Beyond numbers, conduct qualitative studies (e.g., error analysis) to understand *why* certain groups are disproportionately affected by the efficiency method. This can reveal specific feature sensitivities or data representation issues.\\n\\n### 4. Generalizability of Fairness Concerns to Other Datasets and Tasks\\n\\nThe fairness concerns identified in this paper are **highly generalizable** to other datasets and tasks, especially for methods that modify or compress learned representations.\\n\\n**Why it's generalizable:**\\n\\n*   **Minority Data Challenges:** Minority groups often have:\\n    *   **Smaller sample sizes:** Leading to models learning less robust and potentially more brittle representations for these groups.\\n    *   **Higher variance or \\\"edge cases\\\":** Their data might contain more unique patterns or exceptions that are not well-covered by the majority.\\n    *   **Lower data quality:** Historical biases or collection methods can lead to noisier or less complete data for certain demographics.\\n*   **Impact of Compression/Pruning:** Any technique that compresses, prunes, or distills a model inherently involves discarding information. If the \\\"redundant\\\" information disproportionately contains the subtle, hard-to-learn signals crucial for minority groups (due to their smaller sample size or higher variance), then these groups will inevitably suffer a larger performance drop.\\n*   **Ubiquity of Bias:** Datasets themselves often reflect societal biases, and models trained on them learn these biases. Efficiency techniques applied to such models might amplify or redistribute these existing biases.\\n\\n**Variations in Generalizability:**\\n\\nWhile the *existence* of fairness concerns is generalizable, the *extent* and *nature* of the degradation will vary significantly based on:\\n*   **Dataset characteristics:** The degree of imbalance, the specific sensitive attributes, and the inherent \\\"difficulty\\\" of learning for different groups.\\n*   **Task type:** Classification vs. regression vs. generative tasks may manifest fairness issues differently (e.g., misclassification rates vs. prediction errors vs. biased generation).\\n*   **Model architecture:** Different architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs) might respond differently to efficiency techniques, potentially affecting different parts of their representations.\\n*   **Specific efficiency technique:** Pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, etc., each have unique ways of modifying representations, leading to different fairness implications.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the findings in \\\"Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy\\\" regarding fairness-efficiency tradeoffs are significant and point to a fundamental challenge in responsible AI development. Addressing these concerns requires a shift from solely optimizing for efficiency to a more holistic approach that integrates fairness as a primary design constraint, supported by robust measurement and transparent reporting.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.62414385\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the significance and validity of the identified fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in the paper titled 'Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy'.

Provide tools or analysis methods for users to audit the model\\'s performance on different subgroups. This enables informed deployment decisions.\\n5.  **Tradeoff Curves (Pareto Fronts):** Instead of just presenting a single tradeoff point, show a \"Pareto frontier\" illustrating the range of possible fairness-efficiency tradeoffs. This empowers practitioners to choose the desired balance based on their specific application\\'s ethical requirements and constraints.\\n6.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** For high-stakes applications, even efficient models might require human oversight or review for sensitive cases, especially for predictions concerning minority groups.\\n7.  **Qualitative Analysis:** Beyond numbers, conduct qualitative studies (e.g., error analysis) to understand *why* certain groups are disproportionately affected by the efficiency method. This can reveal specific feature sensitivities or data representation issues.\\n\\n### 4. Generalizability of Fairness Concerns to Other Datasets and Tasks\\n\\nThe fairness concerns identified in this paper are **highly generalizable** to other datasets and tasks, especially for methods that modify or compress learned representations.\\n\\n**Why it\\'s generalizable:**\\n\\n*   **Minority Data Challenges:** Minority groups often have:\\n    *   **Smaller sample sizes:** Leading to models learning less robust and potentially more brittle representations for these groups.\\n    *   **Higher variance or \"edge cases\":** Their data might contain more unique patterns or exceptions that are not well-covered by the majority.\\n    *   **Lower data quality:** Historical biases or collection methods can lead to noisier or less complete data for certain demographics.\\n*   **Impact of Compression/Pruning:** Any technique that compresses, prunes, or distills a model inherently involves discarding information. If the \"redundant\" information disproportionately contains the subtle, hard-to-learn signals crucial for minority groups (due to their smaller sample size or higher variance), then these groups will inevitably suffer a larger performance drop.\\n*   **Ubiquity of Bias:** Datasets themselves often reflect societal biases, and models trained on them learn these biases. Efficiency techniques applied to such models might amplify or redistribute these existing biases.\\n\\n**Variations in Generalizability:**\\n\\nWhile the *existence* of fairness concerns is generalizable, the *extent* and *nature* of the degradation will vary significantly based on:\\n*   **Dataset characteristics:** The degree of imbalance, the specific sensitive attributes, and the inherent \"difficulty\" of learning for different groups.\\n*   **Task type:** Classification vs. regression vs. generative tasks may manifest fairness issues differently (e.g., misclassification rates vs. prediction errors vs. biased generation).\\n*   **Model architecture:** Different architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs) might respond differently to efficiency techniques, potentially affecting different parts of their representations.\\n*   **Specific efficiency technique:** Pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, etc., each have unique ways of modifying representations, leading to different fairness implications.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the findings in \"Learned Neural Network Representations are Spread Diffusely with Redundancy\" regarding fairness-efficiency tradeoffs are significant and point to a fundamental challenge in responsible AI development. Addressing these concerns requires a shift from solely optimizing for efficiency to a more holistic approach that integrates fairness as a primary design constraint, supported by robust measurement and transparent reporting.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.62414385}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that all three agents have provided their evaluations, I will synthesize their feedback to arrive at a final decision.\n\n*   **RedundancyAnalyst**: The agent finds the proposed measure of diffused redundancy theoretically sound and intuitively appealing.
