The paper title is: Diffusion-based Image Translation using disentangled style and content representation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Image translation is a task in which the model receives an input image and converts it into a target domain. Early image translation approaches (Zhu et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020; Isola et al., 2017) were mainly designed for single domain translation, but soon extended to multi-domain translation (Choi et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). As these methods demand large training set for each domain, image translation approaches using only a single image pairs have been studied, which include the one-to-one image translation using multiscale training (Lin et al., 2020), or patch matching strategy (Granot et al., 2022; Kolkin et al., 2019). Most recently, Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al., 2022) exploits a pre-trained DINO ViT (Caron et al., 2021) to convert the semantic appearance of a given image into a target domain while maintaining the structure of input image. On the other hand, by employing the recent text-to-image embedding model such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), several approaches have attempted to generate images conditioned on text prompts (Patashnik et al., 2021; Gal et al., 2021; Crowson et al., 2022; Couairon et al., 2022). As these methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) as a backbone generative model, the semantic changes are not often properly controlled when applied to an out-of-data (OOD) image generation. Recently, score-based generative models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020b; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in text-conditioned image generation (Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b; Crowson, 2022; Avrahami et al., 2022). However, when it comes to the image translation scenario in which multiple conditions (e.g. input image, text condition) are given to the score based model, disentangling and separately controlling the components still remains as an open problem. In fact, one of the most important open questions in image translation by diffusion models is to transform only the semantic information (or style) while maintaining the structure information (or content) of the input image. Although this could not be an issue with the conditional diffusion models trained with matched input and target domain images (Saharia et al., 2022a), such training is impractical in many image translation tasks (e.g. summer-to-winter, horse-to-zebra translation). On the other hand, existing methods using unconditional diffusion models often fail to preserve content information due to the entanglement problems in which semantic and content change at the same time (Avrahami et al., 2022; Crowson, 2022). DiffusionCLIP (Kim et al., 2022) tried to address this problem using denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) (Song et al., 2020a) and pixel-wise loss, but the score function needs to be fine-tuned for a novel target domain, which is computationally expensive. In order to control the diffusion process in such a way that it produces the output that simultaneously retain the content of the input image and follow the semantics of the target text or image, here we introduce a loss function using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Specifically, inspired by the recent idea (Tumanyan et al., 2022), we extract intermediate keys of multihead self attention layer and [CLS] classification tokens of the last layer from the DINO ViT model and used them as our content and style regularization, respectively. More specifically, to preserve the structural information, we use the similarity and contrastive loss between intermediate keys of the input and denoised image during the sampling. Then, an image guided style transfer is performed by matching the [CLS] token between the denoised sample and the target domain, whereas additional CLIP loss is used for the text-driven style transfer. To further improve the sampling speed, we propose a novel semantic divergence loss and resampling strategy. Extensive experimental results including Fig. 1 confirmed that our method provide state-of-the-art performance in both text- and image- guided style transfer tasks quantitatively and qualitatively. To our best knowledge, this is the first unconditional diffusion model-based image translation method that allows both text- and image- guided style transfer without altering input image content. 2 RELATED WORK: Text-guided image synthesis. Thanks to the outstanding performance of text-to-image alignment in the feature space, CLIP has been widely used in various text-related computer vision tasks including object generation (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a), style transfer (Kwon & Ye, 2021; Fu et al., 2021), object segmentation (Lu\u0308ddecke & Ecker, 2022; Wang et al., 2022b), etc. Several recent approaches also demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in text-guided image manipulation task by combining the CLIP with image generation models. Previous approaches leverage pre-trained StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020) for image manipulation with a text condition (Patashnik et al., 2021; Gal et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022). However, StyleGAN-based methods cannot be used in arbitrary natural images since it is restricted to the pre-trained data domain. Pre-trained VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021) was proposed for better generalization capability in the image manipulation, but it often suffers from poor image quality due to limited power of the backbone model. With the advance of score-based generative models such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020), several methods (Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b) tried to generate photo-realistic image samples with given text conditions. However, these approaches are not adequate for image translation framework as the text condition and input image are not usually disentangled. Although DiffusionCLIP (Kim et al., 2022) partially solves the problem using DDIM sampling and pixelwise regularization during the reverse diffusion, it has major disadvantage in that it requires fine-tuning process of score models. Single-shot Image Translation. In image translation using single target image, early models mainly focused on image style transfer (Gatys et al., 2016; Huang & Belongie, 2017; Park & Lee, 2019; Yoo et al., 2019). Afterwards, methods using StyleGAN adaptation (Ojha et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Kwon & Ye, 2022; Chong & Forsyth, 2021) showed great performance, but there are limitations as the models are domain-specific (e.g. human faces). In order to overcome this, methods for converting unseen image into a semantic of target (Lin et al., 2020; Kolkin et al., 2019; Granot et al., 2022) have been proposed, but these methods often suffer from degraded image quality. Recently, Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al., 2022) successfully exploited pre-trained DINO ViT(Caron et al., 2021) to convert the semantic appearance of given image into target domain while preserving the structure of input. 3 PROPOSED METHOD:  3.1 DDPM SAMPLING WITH MANIFOLD CONSTRAINT: In DDPMs (Ho et al., 2020), starting from a clean image x0 \u223c q(x0), a forward diffusion process q(xt|xt\u22121) is described as a Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise at every time steps t: q(xT |x0) := T\u220f t=1 q(xt|xt\u22121), where q(xt|xt\u22121) := N (xt; \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b2txt\u22121, \u03b2tI), (1) where {\u03b2}Tt=0 is a variance schedule. By denoting \u03b1t := 1 \u2212 \u03b2t and \u03b1\u0304t := \u220ft s=1 \u03b1s, the forward diffused sample at t, i.e. xt, can be sampled in one step as: xt = \u221a \u03b1\u0304tx0 + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223c N (0, I). (2) As the reverse of the forward step q(xt\u22121|xt) is intractable, DDPM learns to maximize the variational lowerbound through a parameterized Gaussian transitions p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) with the parameter \u03b8. Accordingly, the reverse process is approximated as Markov chain with learned mean and fixed variance, starting from p(xT ) = N (xT ; 0, I): p\u03b8(x0:T ) := p\u03b8(xT ) T\u220f t=1 p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt), where p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) := N (xt\u22121;\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03c32t I). (3) where \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) := 1\u221a \u03b1t ( xt \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b1t\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) ) , (4) Here, \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) is the diffusion model trained by optimizing the objective: min \u03b8 L(\u03b8), where L(\u03b8) := Et,x0,\u03f5 [ \u2225\u03f5\u2212 \u03f5\u03b8( \u221a \u03b1\u0304tx0 + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u03f5, t)\u22252 ] . (5) After the optimization, by plugging learned score function into the generative (or reverse) diffusion process, one can simply sample from p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) by xt\u22121 = \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) + \u03c3t\u03f5 = 1 \u221a \u03b1t ( xt \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b1t\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) ) + \u03c3t\u03f5 (6) In image translation using conditional diffusion models (Saharia et al., 2022a; Sasaki et al., 2021), the diffusion model \u03f5\u03b8 in (5) and (6) should be replaced with \u03f5\u03b8(y, \u221a \u03b1\u0304tx0 + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u03f5, t) where y denotes the matched target image. Accordingly, the sample generation is tightly controlled by the matched target in a supervised manner, so that the image content change rarely happen. Unfortunately, the requirement of the matched targets for the training makes this approach impractical. To address this, Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) proposed classifier-guided image translation using the unconditional diffusion model training as in (5) and a pre-trained classifier p\u03d5(y|xt). Specifically, \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) in (4) and (6) are supplemented with the gradient of the classifier, i.e. \u00b5\u0302\u03b8(xt, t) := \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) + \u03c3t\u2207xt log p\u03d5(y|xt). However, most of the classifiers, which should be separately trained, are not usually sufficient to control the content of the samples from the reverse diffusion process. Inspired by the recent manifold constrained gradient (MCG) for inverse problems (Chung et al., 2022a), here we formulate our content and style guidance problem as an inverse problem, which can be solved by minimizing the following total cost function with respect to the sample x: \u2113total(x;xtrg,xsrc), or \u2113total(x;dtrg,xsrc,dsrc) (7) where xsrc and xtrg refer to the source and target images, respectively; and dsrc and dtrg refer to the source and target text, respectively. In our paper, the first form of the total loss in (7) is used for image-guided translation, where the second form is for the text-guided translation. Then, the sampling from the reverse diffusion with MCG is given by x\u2032t\u22121 = 1 \u221a \u03b1t ( xt \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b1t\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) ) + \u03c3t\u03f5 (8) xt\u22121 = x \u2032 t\u22121 \u2212\u2207xt\u2113total(x\u03020(xt)) (9) where x\u03020(xt) refers to the estimated clean image from the sample xt using the Tweedie\u2019s formula (Kim & Ye, 2021): x\u03020(xt) := xt\u221a \u03b1\u0304t \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u221a \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t). (10) In the following, we describe how the total loss \u2113total is defined. For brevity, we notate x\u03020(xt) as x in the following sections. 3.2 STRUCTURE LOSS: As previously mentioned, the main objective of image translation is maintaining the content structure between output and the input image, while guiding the output to follow semantic of target condition. Existing methods (Couairon et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022) use pixel-wise loss or the perceptual loss for the content preservation. However, the pixel space does not explicitly discriminate content and semantic components: too strong pixel loss hinders the semantic change of output, whereas weak pixel loss alters the structural component along with semantic changes. To address the problem, we need to separately process the semantic and structure information of the image. Recently, Tumanyan et al. (2022) demonstrated successful disentanglement of both components using a pre-trained DINO ViT (Caron et al., 2021). They showed that in ViT, the keys kl of multi-head self attention (MSA) layer contain structure information, and [CLS] token of last layer contains the semantic information. With above features, they proposed a loss for maintaining structure between input and network output with matching the self similarity matrix Sl of the keys, which can be represented in the following form for our problem: \u2113ssim(xsrc,x) = \u2225Sl(xsrc)\u2212 Sl(x)\u2225F , where [ Sl(x) ] i,j = cos(kli(x), k l j(x)), (11) where kli(x) and k l j(x) indicate i, jth key in the l-th MSA layer extracted from ViT with image x. The self-similarity loss can maintain the content information between input and output, but we found that only using this loss results in a weak regularization in our DDPM framework. Since the key ki contains the spatial information corresponding the i-th patch location, we therefore use additional regularization with contrastive learning as shown in Fig. 2(a). Specifically, leveraging the idea of patch-wise contrastive loss (Park et al. (2020)), we define the infoNCE loss using the DINO ViT keys: \u2113cont(xsrc,x) = \u2212 \u2211 i log ( exp(sim(kli(x), k l i(xsrc))/\u03c4) exp(sim(kli(x), k l i(xsrc))/\u03c4 + \u2211 j \u0338=i exp(sim(k l i(x), k l j(xsrc))/\u03c4) ) , (12) where \u03c4 is temperature, and sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) represents the normalized cosine similarity. With this loss, we regularize the key of same positions to have closer distance, while maximizing the distances between the keys at different positions. 3.3 STYLE LOSS: CLIP Loss for Text-guided Image Translation Based on the previous work of Dhariwal & Nichol (2021), CLIP-guided diffusion (Crowson (2022)) proposed to guide the reverse diffusion using pre-trained CLIP model using the following loss function: \u2113CLIP (dtrg,x) := \u2212sim (ET (dtrg), EI(x)) , (13) where dtrg is the target text prompt, and EI , ET refer to the image and text encoder of CLIP, respectively. Although this loss can give text-guidance to diffusion model, the results often suffer from poor image quality. Instead, we propose to use input-aware directional CLIP loss (Gal et al. (2021)) which matches the CLIP embedding of the output image to the target vector in terms of dtrg, dsrc, and xsrc. More specifically, our CLIP-based semantic loss is described as (see also Fig. 2(b)): \u2113CLIP (x;dtrg,xsrc,dsrc) := \u2212sim(vtrg,vsrc) (14) where vtrg := ET (dtrg) + \u03bbiEI(xsrc)\u2212 \u03bbsET (dsrc), vsrc := EI(aug(x)) (15) where aug(\u00b7) denotes the augmentation for preventing adversarial artifacts from CLIP. Here, we simultaneously remove the source domain information \u2212\u03bbsET (dsrc) and reflect the source image information to output +\u03bbiEI(xsrc) according to the values of \u03bbs and \u03bbi. Therefore it is possible to obtain stable outputs compared to using the conventional loss. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing methods using only single pre-trained CLIP model (e.g. ViT/B-32), we improve the text-image embedding performance by using the recently proposed CLIP model ensemble method (Couairon et al. (2022)). Specifically, instead of using a single embedding, we concatenate the multiple embedding vectors from multiple pre-trained CLIP models and used the it as our final embedding. Semantic Style Loss for Image-guided Image Translation In the case of image-guide translation, we propose to use [CLS] token of ViT as our style guidance. As explained in the previous part 3.2, the [CLS] token contains the semantic style information of the image. Therefore, we can guide the diffusion process to match the semantic of the samples to that of target image by minimizing the [CLS] token distances as shown in Fig. 2(c). Also, we found that using only [CLS] tokens often results in misaligned color values. To prevent this, we guide the output to follow the overall color statistic of target image with weak MSE loss between the images. Therefore, our loss function is described as follows: \u2113sty(xtrg,x) = ||eL[CLS](xtrg)\u2212 e L [CLS](x)||2 + \u03bbmse||xtrg \u2212 x||2. (16) where eL[CLS] denotes the last layer [CLS] token. 3.4 ACCELERATION STRATEGY: Semantic Divergence Loss With the proposed loss functions, we can achieve text- or imageguided image translation outputs. However, we empirically observed that the generation process requires large steps to reach the the desired output. To solve the problem, we propose a simple approach to accelerate the diffusion process. As explained before, the [CLS] token of ViT contains the overall semantic information of the image. Since our purpose is to make the semantic information as different from the original as possible while maintaining the structure, we conjecture that we can achieve our desired purpose by maximizing the distance between the [CLS] tokens of the previous step and the current output during the generation process as described in Fig. 2(d). Therefore, our loss function at time t is given by \u2113sem(xt;xt+1) = \u2212||eL[CLS](x\u03020(xt))\u2212 e L [CLS](x\u03020(xt+1))||2, (17) Specifically, we maximize the distance between the denoised output of the present time and the previous time, so that next step sample has different semantic from the previous step. One could think of alternatives to maximize pixel-wise or perceptual distance, but we have experimentally found that in these cases, the content structure is greatly harmed. In contrast, our proposed loss has advantages in terms of image quality because it can control only the semantic appearance. Resampling Strategy As shown in CCDF acceleration strategy (Chung et al., 2022b), a better initialization leads to an accelerated reverse diffusion for inverse problem. Empirically, in our image translation problem we also find that finding the good starting point at time step T for the reverse diffusion affects the overall image quality. Specifically, in order to guide the initial estimate xT to be sufficiently good, we perform N repetition of one reverse sampling xT\u22121 followed by one forward step xT = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b2T\u22121xT\u22121 + \u03b2T\u22121\u03f5 to find the xT whose gradient for the next step is easily affected by the loss. With this initial resampling strategy, we can empirically found the initial xT that can reduce the number of reverse steps. The overall process is in our algorithm in Appendix. 3.5 TOTAL LOSS: Putting all together, the final loss in (7) for the text-guided reverse diffusion is given by \u2113total = \u03bb1\u2113cont + \u03bb2\u2113ssim + \u03bb3\u2113CLIP + \u03bb4\u2113sem + \u03bb5\u2113rng, (18) where \u2113rng is a regularization loss to prevent the irregular step of reverse diffusion process suggested in (Crowson (2022)). If the target style image xtrg is given instead of text conditions dsrc and dtrg, then \u2113CLIP is simply substituted for \u2113sty . 4 EXPERIMENT:  4.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: For implementation, we refer to the official source code of blended diffusion (Avrahami et al. (2022)). All experiments were performed using unconditional score model pre-trained with Imagenet 256\u00d7256 resolution datasets (Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)). In all the experiments, we used diffusion step of T = 60 and the resampling repetition of N = 10; therefore, the total of 70 diffusion reverse steps are used. The generation process takes 40 seconds per image in single RTX 3090 unit. In \u2113CLIP , we used the ensemble of 5 pre-trained CLIP models (RN50, RN50x4, ViTB/32, RN50x16, ViT-B/16) for the text-guidance, following the setup of Couairon et al. (2022). Our detailed experimental settings are elaborated in Appendix. 4.2 TEXT-GUIDED SEMANTIC IMAGE TRANSLATION: To evaluate the performance of our text-guided image translation, we conducted comparisons with state-of-the-art baseline models. For baseline methods, we selected the recently proposed models which use pre-trained CLIP for text-guided image manipulation: VQGAN-CLIP (Crowson et al. (2022)), CLIP-guided diffusion (CGD) (Crowson (2022)), DiffusionCLIP (Kim et al. (2022)), and FlexIT (Couairon et al. (2022)). For all baseline methods, we referenced the official source codes. Since our framework can be applied to arbitrary text semantics, we tried quantitative and qualitative evaluation on various kinds of natural image datasets. We tested our translation performance using two different datasets: animal faces (Si & Zhu (2012)) and landscapes (Chen et al. (2018)). The animal face dataset contains 14 classes of animal face images, and the landscapes dataset consists of 7 classes of various natural landscape images. To measure the performance of the generated images, we measured the FID score (Heusel et al. (2017)). However, when using the basic FID score measurement, the output value is not stable because our number of generated images is not large. To compensate for this, we measure the performance using a simplified FID (Kim et al. (2020)) that does not consider the diagonal term of the feature distributions. Also, we additionally showed a class-wise SFID score that measures the SFID for each class of the converted output because it is necessary to measure whether the converted output accurately reflects the semantic information of the target class. Finally, we used the averaged LPIPS score between input and output to verify the content preservation performance of our method. Further experimental settings can be found in our Appendix. In Table 1, we show the quantitative comparison results. In image quality measurement using SFID and CSFID, our model showed the best performance among all baseline methods. Especially for Animals dataset, our SFID value outperformed others in large gain. In the content preservation by LPIPS score, our method scored the second best. In case of FlexIT, it showed the best score in LPIPS since the model is directly trained with LPIPS loss. However, too low value of LPIPS is undesired as it means that the model failed in proper semantic change. This can be also seen in qualitative result of Figs. 3 and 4, where our results have proper semantic features of target texts with content preservation, whereas the results from FlexIT failed in semantic change as it is too strongly confined to the source images. In other baseline methods, most of the methods failed in proper content preservation. To further evaluate the perceptual quality of generated samples, we conducted user study. In order to measure the detailed opinions, we used custom-made opinion scoring system. We asked the users in three different parts: 1) Are the output have correct semantic of target text? (Text-match), 2) are the generated images realistic? (Realism), 3) do the outputs contains the content information of source images? (Content). Detailed user-study settings are in our Appendix. In Table 1, our model showed the best performance, which further shows the superiority of our method. 4.3 IMAGE-GUIDED SEMANTIC IMAGE TRANSLATION: Since our methods can be easily adapted to the image translation guided by target images, we further evaluate the performance of out model with comparison experiments. We compare our model with appearance transfer models of Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al. (2022)), STROTSS (Kolkin et al. (2019)), and style transfer methods WCT2 (Yoo et al. (2019)) and SANet (Park & Lee (2019)). Fig. 5 is a qualitative comparison result of image guided translation task. Our model successfully generated outputs that follow the semantic styles of the target images while maintaining the content of the source images. In the case of other models, we can see that the content was severely deformed or the semantic style was not properly reflected. We also measured the overall perceptual quality through a user study. As with text-guided translation, we investigated user opinion through three different questions. In Table 2, our model obtained the best score in style matching score and the second best in realism and content preservation scores. Baseline WCT2 showed the best in realism and content scores, but it shows the worst score in style matching because the outputs are hardly changed from the inputs except for overall colors. The opinions scores confirm that our model outperforms the baselines. More details are in our Appendix. 4.4 ABLATION STUDY: To verify the proposed components in our framework, we compare the generation performance with different settings. In Fig. 6, we show that (a) the outputs from our best setting have the correct semantic of target text, with preserving the content of the source; (b) by removing \u2113sem, the results still have the appearance of source images, suggesting that images are not fully converted to the target domain; (c) without \u2113cont, the output images totally failed to capture the content of source images; (d) by using LPIPS perceptual loss instead of proposed \u2113cont, the results can only capture the approximate content of source images; (e) using pixel-wise l2 maximization loss instead of proposed \u2113sem, the outputs suffer from irregular artifacts; (f) without using our proposed resampling trick, the results cannot fully reflect the semantic information of target texts. Overall, we can obtain the best generation outputs by using all of our proposed components. For further evaluation, we will show the quantitative results of ablation study in our Appendix. 5 CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we proposed a novel loss function which utilizes a pre-trained ViT model to guide the generation process of DDPM models in terms of content preservation and semantic changes. We further propose a novel strategy of resampling technique for better initialization of diffusion process. For evaluation, our extensive experimental results show that our proposed framework has superior performance compared to baselines in both of text- and image-guided semantic image translation tasks. A EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: A.1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS For implementation, in case of using text-guided image manipulation, our initial sampling numbers are set as T = 100, but we skipped the initial 40 steps to maintain the abstract content of input image. Therefore, the total number of sampling steps is T = 60. With resampling step of N = 10, we use total of 70 iterations for single image output. We found that using more resampling steps does not show meaningful performance improvement. In image-guided manipulation, we set initial sampling number T = 200, and skipped the initial 80 steps. We used resampling step N = 10. Therefore, we use total of 130 iterations. Although we used more iterations than text-guided translation, it takes about 40 seconds. For hyperparameters, we use \u03bb1 = 200, \u03bb2 = 100, \u03bb3 = 2000, \u03bb4 = 1000, \u03bb5 = 200. For imageguided translation, we set \u03bbmse = 1.5. For our CLIP loss, we set \u03bbs = 0.4 and \u03bbi = 0.2. For our ViT backbone model, we used pre-trained DINO ViT that follows the baseline of Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al., 2022). For extracting keys of intermediate layer, we use layer of l = 11, and for [CLS] token, we used last layer output. Since ViT and CLIP model only take 224\u00d7224 resolution images, we resized all images before calculating the losses with ViT and CLIP. To further improve the sample quality of our qualitative results, we used restarting trick in which we check the \u2113reg loss calculated at initial time step T , and restart the whole process if the loss value is too high. If the initial loss \u2113reg > 0.01, we restarted the process. For quantitative result, we did not use the restart trick for fair comparison. For augmentation, we use the same geometrical augmentations proposed in FlexIT(Couairon et al., 2022). Also, following the setting from CLIP-guided diffusion(Crowson, 2022), we included noise augmentation in which we mix the noisy image to x\u03020(xt) as it further removes the artifacts. In our image-guided image translation on natural landscape images, we matched the color distribution of output image to that of target image with (Hahne & Aggoun, 2021), as it showed better perceptual quality. Our detailed implementation can be found in our official GitHub repository.1 For baseline experiments, we followed the official source codes in all of the models2345. For diffusion-based models (DiffusionCLIP, CLIP-guided diffusion), we used unconditional score model pre-trained on 256\u00d7256 resolutions. In DiffusionCLIP, we fine-tuned the score model longer than suggested training iteration, as it showed better quality. In CLIP-guided diffusion, we set the CLIP-guided loss as 2000, and also set initial sampling number as T = 100 with skipping initial 40 steps. For VQGAN-based models (FlexIT, VQGAN-CLIP), we used VQGAN trained on imagenet 256\u00d7256 resolutions datasets. In VQGAN-CLIP, as using longer iteration results in extremely degraded images, therefore we optimized only 30 iterations, which is smaller than suggested iterations (\u226580). In the experiments of FlexIT, we followed the exactly same settings suggested in the original paper. For baselines of image-guided style transfer tasks, we also referenced the original source codes6789. In all of the experiments, we followed the suggested settings from the original papers. A.2 DATASET DETAILS For our quantitative results using text-guided image translation, we used two different datasets Animals and Landscapes. In Animals dataset, the original dataset contains 21 different classes, but we filtered out the images from 14 classes (bear, cat, cow, deer, dog, lion, monkey, mouse, panda, pig, 1https://github.com/anon294384/DiffuseIT 2https://github.com/afiaka87/clip-guided-diffusion 3https://github.com/nerdyrodent/VQGAN-CLIP 4https://github.com/gwang-kim/DiffusionCLIP 5https://github.com/facebookresearch/SemanticImageTranslation 6https://github.com/omerbt/Splice 7https://github.com/nkolkin13/STROTSS 8https://github.com/clovaai/WCT2 9https://github.com/GlebSBrykin/SANET rabbit, sheep, tiger, wolf) which can be classified as mammals. Remaining classes (e.g. human, chicken, etc.) are removed since they have far different semantics from the mammal faces.Therefore we reported quantitative scores only with filtered datasets for fair comparison. The dataset contains 100-300 images per each class, and we selected 4 testing images from each class in order to use them as our content source images. With selected samples, we calculated the metrics using the outputs of translating the 4 images from a source class into all the remaining classes. Therefore, in our animal face dataset, total of 676 generated images are used for evaluation. In Landscapes dataset, we manually classified the images into 7 different classes (beach, desert, forest, grass field, mountain, sea, snow). Each class has 300 different images except for desert class which have 100 different images. Since some classes have not enough number of images, we borrowed images from seasons (Anoosheh et al., 2018) dataset. For metric calculation, we selected 8 testing images from each class, and used them as our content source images. Again, we translated the 8 images from source class into all the remaining classes. Therefore, a total of 336 generated images are used for our quantitative evaluation. For single image guided translation, we selected random images from AFHQ dataset for animal face translation; and for natural image generation, we selected random images from our Landscapes datasets. A.3 USER STUDY DETAILS For our user study in text-guided image translation task, we generated 130 different images using 13 different text conditions with our proposed and baseline models. Then we randomly selected 65 images and made 6 different questions. More specifically, we asked the participants question about three different parts: 1) Are the outputs have correct semantic of target text? (Text-match), 2) Are the generated images realistic? (Realism), 3) Do the outputs contain the content information of source images (Content). We randomly recruited a total of 30 users, and provided them the questions using Google Form. The 30 different users come from age group 20s and 50s. We set the minimum score as 1, and the maximum score is 5. The users can score among 5 different options : 1-Very Unlikely, 2-Unlikely, 3-Normal, 4-Likely, 5-Very Likely. For the user study on image-guided translation task, we generated 40 different images using 8 different images conditions. Then we followed the same protocol to user study on text-guided image translation tasks, except for the content of questions. We asked the users in three different parts: 1) Are the outputs have correct semantic of target style image? (Style-match), 2) Are the generated images realistic? (Realism), 3) Do the outputs contain the content information of source images (Content). A.4 ALGORITHM For detailed explanation, we include Algorithm of our proposed image translation mathods in Algorithm 1. B QUANTITATIVE ABLATION STUDY: For more thorough evaluation of our proposed components, we report ablation study on quantitative metrics. In this experiment, we only used Animals dataset due to the time limit. In Table 3, we show the quantitative results on various settings. When we remove one of our acceleration strategies, in setting (b) and (f), we can see that the fid score is degraded as the outputs are not properly changed from the original source images. (e) When we use L2 maximization instead of our proposed \u2113sem, FID scores are improved from setting (b), but still the performance is not on par with our best settings. (d) When we use weak content regularization using LPIPS, we can see that the overall scores are degraded. When we remove our proposed \u2113cont, we can observe that SFID and CSFID scores are lower than other settings. However, we can see that LPIPS score is severely high as the model hardly reflect the content information of original source images. Overall, when using our best setting, we can obtain the best output considering all of the scores.

With simply changing the text conditions, or using artistic paintings as our image conditions, we can obtain the artistic style transfer results as shown in Fig. 7. D FACE IMAGE TRANSLATION: Instead of using score mode pre-trained on Imagenet dataset, we can use pre-trained score model on FFHQ human face dataset. In order to keep the face identity between source and output images, we include \u03bbid\u2113id which leverage pre-trained face identification model ArcFace(Deng et al., 2019). We calculate identity loss between xsrc and denoised image x\u03020(xt). We use \u03bbid = 100. In Fig. 8, we show that our method also can be used in face image translation tasks. For comparison, we included baseline models of face editing method StyleCLIP (Patashnik et al., 2021), and oneshot face stylization model of JojoGAN (Chong & Forsyth, 2021). The results show that our method can translate the source faces into target domain with proper semantic change. In baseline models, although some images show high quality outputs, in most cases the image failed in translating the images. Also, since the baseline models rely on pre-trained StyleGAN, they require additional GAN inversion process to translate the source image. Therefore, the content information is not perfectly matched to the source image due to the limitation of GAN inversion methods. E LIMITATION AND FUTURE WORK: Although our method has shown successful performance in image conversion, it still has limitations to solve. First, if the semantic distance between the source image and the target domain is too far (e.g building\u2192 Tiger), the output is not translated properly. We conjecture that this occurs when the text-image embedding space in the CLIP model is not accurately aligned, therefore it can be solved by using the advanced text-to-image embedding model. Second, our method has limitation that the image generation quality heavily relies on the performance of the pre-trained score model. This can also be solved if we use a diffusion model backbone with better performance. In future work, we plan to improve our proposed method in these two directions. F ADDITIONAL RESULTS: For additional results , in Fig. 9 we show the image translation outputs using text conditions. In Fig. 10, we additionally show the results from our image-guided image translation. We can successfully change the semantic of various natural images with text and image conditions.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023.

The paper title is: Diffusion-based Image Translation using disentangled style and content representation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Image translation is a task in which the model receives an input image and converts it into a target domain. Early image translation approaches (Zhu et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020; Isola et al., 2017) were mainly designed for single domain translation, but soon extended to multi-domain translation (Choi et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). As these methods demand large training set for each domain, image translation approaches using only a single image pairs have been studied, which include the one-to-one image translation using multiscale training (Lin et al., 2020), or patch matching strategy (Granot et al., 2022; Kolkin et al., 2019). Most recently, Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al., 2022) exploits a pre-trained DINO ViT (Caron et al., 2021) to convert the semantic appearance of a given image into a target domain while maintaining the structure of input image. On the other hand, by employing the recent text-to-image embedding model such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), several approaches have attempted to generate images conditioned on text prompts (Patashnik et al., 2021; Gal et al., 2021; Crowson et al., 2022; Couairon et al., 2022). As these methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) as a backbone generative model, the semantic changes are not often properly controlled when applied to an out-of-data (OOD) image generation. Recently, score-based generative models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020b; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in text-conditioned image generation (Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b; Crowson, 2022; Avrahami et al., 2022). However, when it comes to the image translation scenario in which multiple conditions (e.g. input image, text condition) are given to the score based model, disentangling and separately controlling the components still remains as an open problem. In fact, one of the most important open questions in image translation by diffusion models is to transform only the semantic information (or style) while maintaining the structure information (or content) of the input image. Although this could not be an issue with the conditional diffusion models trained with matched input and target domain images (Saharia et al., 2022a), such training is impractical in many image translation tasks (e.g. summer-to-winter, horse-to-zebra translation). On the other hand, existing methods using unconditional diffusion models often fail to preserve content information due to the entanglement problems in which semantic and content change at the same time (Avrahami et al., 2022; Crowson, 2022). DiffusionCLIP (Kim et al., 2022) tried to address this problem using denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) (Song et al., 2020a) and pixel-wise loss, but the score function needs to be fine-tuned for a novel target domain, which is computationally expensive. In order to control the diffusion process in such a way that it produces the output that simultaneously retain the content of the input image and follow the semantics of the target text or image, here we introduce a loss function using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Specifically, inspired by the recent idea (Tumanyan et al., 2022), we extract intermediate keys of multihead self attention layer and [CLS] classification tokens of the last layer from the DINO ViT model and used them as our content and style regularization, respectively. More specifically, to preserve the structural information, we use the similarity and contrastive loss between intermediate keys of the input and denoised image during the sampling. Then, an image guided style transfer is performed by matching the [CLS] token between the denoised sample and the target domain, whereas additional CLIP loss is used for the text-driven style transfer. To further improve the sampling speed, we propose a novel semantic divergence loss and resampling strategy. Extensive experimental results including Fig. 1 confirmed that our method provide state-of-the-art performance in both text- and image- guided style transfer tasks quantitatively and qualitatively. To our best knowledge, this is the first unconditional diffusion model-based image translation method that allows both text- and image- guided style transfer without altering input image content. 2 RELATED WORK: Text-guided image synthesis. Thanks to the outstanding performance of text-to-image alignment in the feature space, CLIP has been widely used in various text-related computer vision tasks including object generation (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a), style transfer (Kwon & Ye, 2021; Fu et al., 2021), object segmentation (Lu\u0308ddecke & Ecker, 2022; Wang et al., 2022b), etc. Several recent approaches also demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in text-guided image manipulation task by combining the CLIP with image generation models. Previous approaches leverage pre-trained StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020) for image manipulation with a text condition (Patashnik et al., 2021; Gal et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022). However, StyleGAN-based methods cannot be used in arbitrary natural images since it is restricted to the pre-trained data domain. Pre-trained VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021) was proposed for better generalization capability in the image manipulation, but it often suffers from poor image quality due to limited power of the backbone model. With the advance of score-based generative models such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020), several methods (Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b) tried to generate photo-realistic image samples with given text conditions. However, these approaches are not adequate for image translation framework as the text condition and input image are not usually disentangled. Although DiffusionCLIP (Kim et al., 2022) partially solves the problem using DDIM sampling and pixelwise regularization during the reverse diffusion, it has major disadvantage in that it requires fine-tuning process of score models. Single-shot Image Translation. In image translation using single target image, early models mainly focused on image style transfer (Gatys et al., 2016; Huang & Belongie, 2017; Park & Lee, 2019; Yoo et al., 2019). Afterwards, methods using StyleGAN adaptation (Ojha et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Kwon & Ye, 2022; Chong & Forsyth, 2021) showed great performance, but there are limitations as the models are domain-specific (e.g. human faces). In order to overcome this, methods for converting unseen image into a semantic of target (Lin et al., 2020; Kolkin et al., 2019; Granot et al., 2022) have been proposed, but these methods often suffer from degraded image quality. Recently, Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al., 2022) successfully exploited pre-trained DINO ViT(Caron et al., 2021) to convert the semantic appearance of given image into target domain while preserving the structure of input. 3 PROPOSED METHOD:  3.1 DDPM SAMPLING WITH MANIFOLD CONSTRAINT: In DDPMs (Ho et al., 2020), starting from a clean image x0 \u223c q(x0), a forward diffusion process q(xt|xt\u22121) is described as a Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise at every time steps t: q(xT |x0) := T\u220f t=1 q(xt|xt\u22121), where q(xt|xt\u22121) := N (xt; \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b2txt\u22121, \u03b2tI), (1) where {\u03b2}Tt=0 is a variance schedule. By denoting \u03b1t := 1 \u2212 \u03b2t and \u03b1\u0304t := \u220ft s=1 \u03b1s, the forward diffused sample at t, i.e. xt, can be sampled in one step as: xt = \u221a \u03b1\u0304tx0 + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223c N (0, I). (2) As the reverse of the forward step q(xt\u22121|xt) is intractable, DDPM learns to maximize the variational lowerbound through a parameterized Gaussian transitions p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) with the parameter \u03b8. Accordingly, the reverse process is approximated as Markov chain with learned mean and fixed variance, starting from p(xT ) = N (xT ; 0, I): p\u03b8(x0:T ) := p\u03b8(xT ) T\u220f t=1 p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt), where p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) := N (xt\u22121;\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03c32t I). (3) where \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) := 1\u221a \u03b1t ( xt \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b1t\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) ) , (4) Here, \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) is the diffusion model trained by optimizing the objective: min \u03b8 L(\u03b8), where L(\u03b8) := Et,x0,\u03f5 [ \u2225\u03f5\u2212 \u03f5\u03b8( \u221a \u03b1\u0304tx0 + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u03f5, t)\u22252 ] . (5) After the optimization, by plugging learned score function into the generative (or reverse) diffusion process, one can simply sample from p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) by xt\u22121 = \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) + \u03c3t\u03f5 = 1 \u221a \u03b1t ( xt \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b1t\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) ) + \u03c3t\u03f5 (6) In image translation using conditional diffusion models (Saharia et al., 2022a; Sasaki et al., 2021), the diffusion model \u03f5\u03b8 in (5) and (6) should be replaced with \u03f5\u03b8(y, \u221a \u03b1\u0304tx0 + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u03f5, t) where y denotes the matched target image. Accordingly, the sample generation is tightly controlled by the matched target in a supervised manner, so that the image content change rarely happen. Unfortunately, the requirement of the matched targets for the training makes this approach impractical. To address this, Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) proposed classifier-guided image translation using the unconditional diffusion model training as in (5) and a pre-trained classifier p\u03d5(y|xt). Specifically, \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) in (4) and (6) are supplemented with the gradient of the classifier, i.e. \u00b5\u0302\u03b8(xt, t) := \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) + \u03c3t\u2207xt log p\u03d5(y|xt). However, most of the classifiers, which should be separately trained, are not usually sufficient to control the content of the samples from the reverse diffusion process. Inspired by the recent manifold constrained gradient (MCG) for inverse problems (Chung et al., 2022a), here we formulate our content and style guidance problem as an inverse problem, which can be solved by minimizing the following total cost function with respect to the sample x: \u2113total(x;xtrg,xsrc), or \u2113total(x;dtrg,xsrc,dsrc) (7) where xsrc and xtrg refer to the source and target images, respectively; and dsrc and dtrg refer to the source and target text, respectively. In our paper, the first form of the total loss in (7) is used for image-guided translation, where the second form is for the text-guided translation. Then, the sampling from the reverse diffusion with MCG is given by x\u2032t\u22121 = 1 \u221a \u03b1t ( xt \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b1t\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) ) + \u03c3t\u03f5 (8) xt\u22121 = x \u2032 t\u22121 \u2212\u2207xt\u2113total(x\u03020(xt)) (9) where x\u03020(xt) refers to the estimated clean image from the sample xt using the Tweedie\u2019s formula (Kim & Ye, 2021): x\u03020(xt) := xt\u221a \u03b1\u0304t \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304t\u221a \u03b1\u0304t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t). (10) In the following, we describe how the total loss \u2113total is defined. For brevity, we notate x\u03020(xt) as x in the following sections. 3.2 STRUCTURE LOSS: As previously mentioned, the main objective of image translation is maintaining the content structure between output and the input image, while guiding the output to follow semantic of target condition. Existing methods (Couairon et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022) use pixel-wise loss or the perceptual loss for the content preservation. However, the pixel space does not explicitly discriminate content and semantic components: too strong pixel loss hinders the semantic change of output, whereas weak pixel loss alters the structural component along with semantic changes. To address the problem, we need to separately process the semantic and structure information of the image. Recently, Tumanyan et al. (2022) demonstrated successful disentanglement of both components using a pre-trained DINO ViT (Caron et al., 2021). They showed that in ViT, the keys kl of multi-head self attention (MSA) layer contain structure information, and [CLS] token of last layer contains the semantic information. With above features, they proposed a loss for maintaining structure between input and network output with matching the self similarity matrix Sl of the keys, which can be represented in the following form for our problem: \u2113ssim(xsrc,x) = \u2225Sl(xsrc)\u2212 Sl(x)\u2225F , where [ Sl(x) ] i,j = cos(kli(x), k l j(x)), (11) where kli(x) and k l j(x) indicate i, jth key in the l-th MSA layer extracted from ViT with image x. The self-similarity loss can maintain the content information between input and output, but we found that only using this loss results in a weak regularization in our DDPM framework. Since the key ki contains the spatial information corresponding the i-th patch location, we therefore use additional regularization with contrastive learning as shown in Fig. 2(a). Specifically, leveraging the idea of patch-wise contrastive loss (Park et al. (2020)), we define the infoNCE loss using the DINO ViT keys: \u2113cont(xsrc,x) = \u2212 \u2211 i log ( exp(sim(kli(x), k l i(xsrc))/\u03c4) exp(sim(kli(x), k l i(xsrc))/\u03c4 + \u2211 j \u0338=i exp(sim(k l i(x), k l j(xsrc))/\u03c4) ) , (12) where \u03c4 is temperature, and sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) represents the normalized cosine similarity. With this loss, we regularize the key of same positions to have closer distance, while maximizing the distances between the keys at different positions. 3.3 STYLE LOSS: CLIP Loss for Text-guided Image Translation Based on the previous work of Dhariwal & Nichol (2021), CLIP-guided diffusion (Crowson (2022)) proposed to guide the reverse diffusion using pre-trained CLIP model using the following loss function: \u2113CLIP (dtrg,x) := \u2212sim (ET (dtrg), EI(x)) , (13) where dtrg is the target text prompt, and EI , ET refer to the image and text encoder of CLIP, respectively. Although this loss can give text-guidance to diffusion model, the results often suffer from poor image quality. Instead, we propose to use input-aware directional CLIP loss (Gal et al. (2021)) which matches the CLIP embedding of the output image to the target vector in terms of dtrg, dsrc, and xsrc. More specifically, our CLIP-based semantic loss is described as (see also Fig. 2(b)): \u2113CLIP (x;dtrg,xsrc,dsrc) := \u2212sim(vtrg,vsrc) (14) where vtrg := ET (dtrg) + \u03bbiEI(xsrc)\u2212 \u03bbsET (dsrc), vsrc := EI(aug(x)) (15) where aug(\u00b7) denotes the augmentation for preventing adversarial artifacts from CLIP. Here, we simultaneously remove the source domain information \u2212\u03bbsET (dsrc) and reflect the source image information to output +\u03bbiEI(xsrc) according to the values of \u03bbs and \u03bbi. Therefore it is possible to obtain stable outputs compared to using the conventional loss. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing methods using only single pre-trained CLIP model (e.g. ViT/B-32), we improve the text-image embedding performance by using the recently proposed CLIP model ensemble method (Couairon et al. (2022)). Specifically, instead of using a single embedding, we concatenate the multiple embedding vectors from multiple pre-trained CLIP models and used the it as our final embedding. Semantic Style Loss for Image-guided Image Translation In the case of image-guide translation, we propose to use [CLS] token of ViT as our style guidance. As explained in the previous part 3.2, the [CLS] token contains the semantic style information of the image. Therefore, we can guide the diffusion process to match the semantic of the samples to that of target image by minimizing the [CLS] token distances as shown in Fig. 2(c). Also, we found that using only [CLS] tokens often results in misaligned color values. To prevent this, we guide the output to follow the overall color statistic of target image with weak MSE loss between the images. Therefore, our loss function is described as follows: \u2113sty(xtrg,x) = ||eL[CLS](xtrg)\u2212 e L [CLS](x)||2 + \u03bbmse||xtrg \u2212 x||2. (16) where eL[CLS] denotes the last layer [CLS] token. 3.4 ACCELERATION STRATEGY: Semantic Divergence Loss With the proposed loss functions, we can achieve text- or imageguided image translation outputs. However, we empirically observed that the generation process requires large steps to reach the the desired output. To solve the problem, we propose a simple approach to accelerate the diffusion process. As explained before, the [CLS] token of ViT contains the overall semantic information of the image. Since our purpose is to make the semantic information as different from the original as possible while maintaining the structure, we conjecture that we can achieve our desired purpose by maximizing the distance between the [CLS] tokens of the previous step and the current output during the generation process as described in Fig. 2(d). Therefore, our loss function at time t is given by \u2113sem(xt;xt+1) = \u2212||eL[CLS](x\u03020(xt))\u2212 e L [CLS](x\u03020(xt+1))||2, (17) Specifically, we maximize the distance between the denoised output of the present time and the previous time, so that next step sample has different semantic from the previous step. One could think of alternatives to maximize pixel-wise or perceptual distance, but we have experimentally found that in these cases, the content structure is greatly harmed. In contrast, our proposed loss has advantages in terms of image quality because it can control only the semantic appearance. Resampling Strategy As shown in CCDF acceleration strategy (Chung et al., 2022b), a better initialization leads to an accelerated reverse diffusion for inverse problem. Empirically, in our image translation problem we also find that finding the good starting point at time step T for the reverse diffusion affects the overall image quality. Specifically, in order to guide the initial estimate xT to be sufficiently good, we perform N repetition of one reverse sampling xT\u22121 followed by one forward step xT = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b2T\u22121xT\u22121 + \u03b2T\u22121\u03f5 to find the xT whose gradient for the next step is easily affected by the loss. With this initial resampling strategy, we can empirically found the initial xT that can reduce the number of reverse steps. The overall process is in our algorithm in Appendix. 3.5 TOTAL LOSS: Putting all together, the final loss in (7) for the text-guided reverse diffusion is given by \u2113total = \u03bb1\u2113cont + \u03bb2\u2113ssim + \u03bb3\u2113CLIP + \u03bb4\u2113sem + \u03bb5\u2113rng, (18) where \u2113rng is a regularization loss to prevent the irregular step of reverse diffusion process suggested in (Crowson (2022)). If the target style image xtrg is given instead of text conditions dsrc and dtrg, then \u2113CLIP is simply substituted for \u2113sty . 4 EXPERIMENT:  4.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: For implementation, we refer to the official source code of blended diffusion (Avrahami et al. (2022)). All experiments were performed using unconditional score model pre-trained with Imagenet 256\u00d7256 resolution datasets (Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)). In all the experiments, we used diffusion step of T = 60 and the resampling repetition of N = 10; therefore, the total of 70 diffusion reverse steps are used. The generation process takes 40 seconds per image in single RTX 3090 unit. In \u2113CLIP , we used the ensemble of 5 pre-trained CLIP models (RN50, RN50x4, ViTB/32, RN50x16, ViT-B/16) for the text-guidance, following the setup of Couairon et al. (2022). Our detailed experimental settings are elaborated in Appendix. 4.2 TEXT-GUIDED SEMANTIC IMAGE TRANSLATION: To evaluate the performance of our text-guided image translation, we conducted comparisons with state-of-the-art baseline models. For baseline methods, we selected the recently proposed models which use pre-trained CLIP for text-guided image manipulation: VQGAN-CLIP (Crowson et al. (2022)), CLIP-guided diffusion (CGD) (Crowson (2022)), DiffusionCLIP (Kim et al. (2022)), and FlexIT (Couairon et al. (2022)). For all baseline methods, we referenced the official source codes. Since our framework can be applied to arbitrary text semantics, we tried quantitative and qualitative evaluation on various kinds of natural image datasets. We tested our translation performance using two different datasets: animal faces (Si & Zhu (2012)) and landscapes (Chen et al. (2018)). The animal face dataset contains 14 classes of animal face images, and the landscapes dataset consists of 7 classes of various natural landscape images. To measure the performance of the generated images, we measured the FID score (Heusel et al. (2017)). However, when using the basic FID score measurement, the output value is not stable because our number of generated images is not large. To compensate for this, we measure the performance using a simplified FID (Kim et al. (2020)) that does not consider the diagonal term of the feature distributions. Also, we additionally showed a class-wise SFID score that measures the SFID for each class of the converted output because it is necessary to measure whether the converted output accurately reflects the semantic information of the target class. Finally, we used the averaged LPIPS score between input and output to verify the content preservation performance of our method. Further experimental settings can be found in our Appendix. In Table 1, we show the quantitative comparison results. In image quality measurement using SFID and CSFID, our model showed the best performance among all baseline methods. Especially for Animals dataset, our SFID value outperformed others in large gain. In the content preservation by LPIPS score, our method scored the second best. In case of FlexIT, it showed the best score in LPIPS since the model is directly trained with LPIPS loss. However, too low value of LPIPS is undesired as it means that the model failed in proper semantic change. This can be also seen in qualitative result of Figs. 3 and 4, where our results have proper semantic features of target texts with content preservation, whereas the results from FlexIT failed in semantic change as it is too strongly confined to the source images. In other baseline methods, most of the methods failed in proper content preservation. To further evaluate the perceptual quality of generated samples, we conducted user study. In order to measure the detailed opinions, we used custom-made opinion scoring system. We asked the users in three different parts: 1) Are the output have correct semantic of target text? (Text-match), 2) are the generated images realistic? (Realism), 3) do the outputs contains the content information of source images? (Content). Detailed user-study settings are in our Appendix. In Table 1, our model showed the best performance, which further shows the superiority of our method. 4.3 IMAGE-GUIDED SEMANTIC IMAGE TRANSLATION: Since our methods can be easily adapted to the image translation guided by target images, we further evaluate the performance of out model with comparison experiments. We compare our model with appearance transfer models of Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al. (2022)), STROTSS (Kolkin et al. (2019)), and style transfer methods WCT2 (Yoo et al. (2019)) and SANet (Park & Lee (2019)). Fig. 5 is a qualitative comparison result of image guided translation task. Our model successfully generated outputs that follow the semantic styles of the target images while maintaining the content of the source images. In the case of other models, we can see that the content was severely deformed or the semantic style was not properly reflected. We also measured the overall perceptual quality through a user study. As with text-guided translation, we investigated user opinion through three different questions. In Table 2, our model obtained the best score in style matching score and the second best in realism and content preservation scores. Baseline WCT2 showed the best in realism and content scores, but it shows the worst score in style matching because the outputs are hardly changed from the inputs except for overall colors. The opinions scores confirm that our model outperforms the baselines. More details are in our Appendix. 4.4 ABLATION STUDY: To verify the proposed components in our framework, we compare the generation performance with different settings. In Fig. 6, we show that (a) the outputs from our best setting have the correct semantic of target text, with preserving the content of the source; (b) by removing \u2113sem, the results still have the appearance of source images, suggesting that images are not fully converted to the target domain; (c) without \u2113cont, the output images totally failed to capture the content of source images; (d) by using LPIPS perceptual loss instead of proposed \u2113cont, the results can only capture the approximate content of source images; (e) using pixel-wise l2 maximization loss instead of proposed \u2113sem, the outputs suffer from irregular artifacts; (f) without using our proposed resampling trick, the results cannot fully reflect the semantic information of target texts. Overall, we can obtain the best generation outputs by using all of our proposed components. For further evaluation, we will show the quantitative results of ablation study in our Appendix. 5 CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we proposed a novel loss function which utilizes a pre-trained ViT model to guide the generation process of DDPM models in terms of content preservation and semantic changes. We further propose a novel strategy of resampling technique for better initialization of diffusion process. For evaluation, our extensive experimental results show that our proposed framework has superior performance compared to baselines in both of text- and image-guided semantic image translation tasks. A EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS: A.1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS For implementation, in case of using text-guided image manipulation, our initial sampling numbers are set as T = 100, but we skipped the initial 40 steps to maintain the abstract content of input image. Therefore, the total number of sampling steps is T = 60. With resampling step of N = 10, we use total of 70 iterations for single image output. We found that using more resampling steps does not show meaningful performance improvement. In image-guided manipulation, we set initial sampling number T = 200, and skipped the initial 80 steps. We used resampling step N = 10. Therefore, we use total of 130 iterations. Although we used more iterations than text-guided translation, it takes about 40 seconds. For hyperparameters, we use \u03bb1 = 200, \u03bb2 = 100, \u03bb3 = 2000, \u03bb4 = 1000, \u03bb5 = 200. For imageguided translation, we set \u03bbmse = 1.5. For our CLIP loss, we set \u03bbs = 0.4 and \u03bbi = 0.2. For our ViT backbone model, we used pre-trained DINO ViT that follows the baseline of Splicing ViT (Tumanyan et al., 2022). For extracting keys of intermediate layer, we use layer of l = 11, and for [CLS] token, we used last layer output. Since ViT and CLIP model only take 224\u00d7224 resolution images, we resized all images before calculating the losses with ViT and CLIP. To further improve the sample quality of our qualitative results, we used restarting trick in which we check the \u2113reg loss calculated at initial time step T , and restart the whole process if the loss value is too high. If the initial loss \u2113reg > 0.01, we restarted the process. For quantitative result, we did not use the restart trick for fair comparison. For augmentation, we use the same geometrical augmentations proposed in FlexIT(Couairon et al., 2022). Also, following the setting from CLIP-guided diffusion(Crowson, 2022), we included noise augmentation in which we mix the noisy image to x\u03020(xt) as it further removes the artifacts. In our image-guided image translation on natural landscape images, we matched the color distribution of output image to that of target image with (Hahne & Aggoun, 2021), as it showed better perceptual quality. Our detailed implementation can be found in our official GitHub repository.1 For baseline experiments, we followed the official source codes in all of the models2345. For diffusion-based models (DiffusionCLIP, CLIP-guided diffusion), we used unconditional score model pre-trained on 256\u00d7256 resolutions. In DiffusionCLIP, we fine-tuned the score model longer than suggested training iteration, as it showed better quality. In CLIP-guided diffusion, we set the CLIP-guided loss as 2000, and also set initial sampling number as T = 100 with skipping initial 40 steps. For VQGAN-based models (FlexIT, VQGAN-CLIP), we used VQGAN trained on imagenet 256\u00d7256 resolutions datasets. In VQGAN-CLIP, as using longer iteration results in extremely degraded images, therefore we optimized only 30 iterations, which is smaller than suggested iterations (\u226580). In the experiments of FlexIT, we followed the exactly same settings suggested in the original paper. For baselines of image-guided style transfer tasks, we also referenced the original source codes6789. In all of the experiments, we followed the suggested settings from the original papers. A.2 DATASET DETAILS For our quantitative results using text-guided image translation, we used two different datasets Animals and Landscapes. In Animals dataset, the original dataset contains 21 different classes, but we filtered out the images from 14 classes (bear, cat, cow, deer, dog, lion, monkey, mouse, panda, pig, 1https://github.com/anon294384/DiffuseIT 2https://github.com/afiaka87/clip-guided-diffusion 3https://github.com/nerdyrodent/VQGAN-CLIP 4https://github.com/gwang-kim/DiffusionCLIP 5https://github.com/facebookresearch/SemanticImageTranslation 6https://github.com/omerbt/Splice 7https://github.com/nkolkin13/STROTSS 8https://github.com/clovaai/WCT2 9https://github.com/GlebSBrykin/SANET rabbit, sheep, tiger, wolf) which can be classified as mammals. Remaining classes (e.g. human, chicken, etc.) are removed since they have far different semantics from the mammal faces.Therefore we reported quantitative scores only with filtered datasets for fair comparison. The dataset contains 100-300 images per each class, and we selected 4 testing images from each class in order to use them as our content source images. With selected samples, we calculated the metrics using the outputs of translating the 4 images from a source class into all the remaining classes. Therefore, in our animal face dataset, total of 676 generated images are used for evaluation. In Landscapes dataset, we manually classified the images into 7 different classes (beach, desert, forest, grass field, mountain, sea, snow). Each class has 300 different images except for desert class which have 100 different images. Since some classes have not enough number of images, we borrowed images from seasons (Anoosheh et al., 2018) dataset. For metric calculation, we selected 8 testing images from each class, and used them as our content source images. Again, we translated the 8 images from source class into all the remaining classes. Therefore, a total of 336 generated images are used for our quantitative evaluation. For single image guided translation, we selected random images from AFHQ dataset for animal face translation; and for natural image generation, we selected random images from our Landscapes datasets. A.3 USER STUDY DETAILS For our user study in text-guided image translation task, we generated 130 different images using 13 different text conditions with our proposed and baseline models. Then we randomly selected 65 images and made 6 different questions. More specifically, we asked the participants question about three different parts: 1) Are the outputs have correct semantic of target text? (Text-match), 2) Are the generated images realistic? (Realism), 3) Do the outputs contain the content information of source images (Content). We randomly recruited a total of 30 users, and provided them the questions using Google Form. The 30 different users come from age group 20s and 50s. We set the minimum score as 1, and the maximum score is 5. The users can score among 5 different options : 1-Very Unlikely, 2-Unlikely, 3-Normal, 4-Likely, 5-Very Likely. For the user study on image-guided translation task, we generated 40 different images using 8 different images conditions. Then we followed the same protocol to user study on text-guided image translation tasks, except for the content of questions. We asked the users in three different parts: 1) Are the outputs have correct semantic of target style image? (Style-match), 2) Are the generated images realistic? (Realism), 3) Do the outputs contain the content information of source images (Content). A.4 ALGORITHM For detailed explanation, we include Algorithm of our proposed image translation mathods in Algorithm 1. B QUANTITATIVE ABLATION STUDY: For more thorough evaluation of our proposed components, we report ablation study on quantitative metrics. In this experiment, we only used Animals dataset due to the time limit. In Table 3, we show the quantitative results on various settings. When we remove one of our acceleration strategies, in setting (b) and (f), we can see that the fid score is degraded as the outputs are not properly changed from the original source images. (e) When we use L2 maximization instead of our proposed \u2113sem, FID scores are improved from setting (b), but still the performance is not on par with our best settings. (d) When we use weak content regularization using LPIPS, we can see that the overall scores are degraded. When we remove our proposed \u2113cont, we can observe that SFID and CSFID scores are lower than other settings. However, we can see that LPIPS score is severely high as the model hardly reflect the content information of original source images. Overall, when using our best setting, we can obtain the best output considering all of the scores.

With simply changing the text conditions, or using artistic paintings as our image conditions, we can obtain the artistic style transfer results as shown in Fig. 7. D FACE IMAGE TRANSLATION: Instead of using score mode pre-trained on Imagenet dataset, we can use pre-trained score model on FFHQ human face dataset. In order to keep the face identity between source and output images, we include \u03bbid\u2113id which leverage pre-trained face identification model ArcFace(Deng et al., 2019). We calculate identity loss between xsrc and denoised image x\u03020(xt). We use \u03bbid = 100. In Fig. 8, we show that our method also can be used in face image translation tasks. For comparison, we included baseline models of face editing method StyleCLIP (Patashnik et al., 2021), and oneshot face stylization model of JojoGAN (Chong & Forsyth, 2021). The results show that our method can translate the source faces into target domain with proper semantic change. In baseline models, although some images show high quality outputs, in most cases the image failed in translating the images. Also, since the baseline models rely on pre-trained StyleGAN, they require additional GAN inversion process to translate the source image. Therefore, the content information is not perfectly matched to the source image due to the limitation of GAN inversion methods. E LIMITATION AND FUTURE WORK: Although our method has shown successful performance in image conversion, it still has limitations to solve. First, if the semantic distance between the source image and the target domain is too far (e.g building\u2192 Tiger), the output is not translated properly. We conjecture that this occurs when the text-image embedding space in the CLIP model is not accurately aligned, therefore it can be solved by using the advanced text-to-image embedding model. Second, our method has limitation that the image generation quality heavily relies on the performance of the pre-trained score model. This can also be solved if we use a diffusion model backbone with better performance. In future work, we plan to improve our proposed method in these two directions. F ADDITIONAL RESULTS: For additional results , in Fig. 9 we show the image translation outputs using text conditions. In Fig. 10, we additionally show the results from our image-guided image translation. We can successfully change the semantic of various natural images with text and image conditions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have reviewed the ICLR 2023 reviewer guide.

Introduction**\\n\\nThis report provides a general framework for evaluating the technical soundness of a diffusion model presented in a research paper. Without the specific paper, this evaluation will focus on the common elements, best practices, and potential pitfalls in diffusion model design, training, and inference. The aim is to provide a structured approach to assess the correctness of the theoretical foundations, the robustness of the implementation details, and the efficiency of the proposed method.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Diffusion Model Architecture and Formulation**\\n\\n**2.1. Forward (Diffusion) Process:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Mathematical Formulation:** Is the forward process clearly defined? Is it a fixed Markov chain (as in DDPM/SDEs)? Are the noise addition steps (e.g., Gaussian noise) mathematically sound?\\n    *   **Variance Schedule:** Is the choice of variance schedule ($\\\\beta_t$ or $\\\\alpha_t$) justified? Common choices include linear, cosine (DDPM), or more complex learned schedules. A well-chosen schedule ensures stable diffusion to pure noise and good signal-to-noise ratio throughout the process.\\n    *   **Assumptions:** Are any underlying assumptions (e.g., data distribution assumptions, independence of noise) explicitly stated and consistent with the chosen formulation?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   The forward process is typically fixed and not learned, so its direct computational cost is minimal during training. However, its design influences the complexity of the reverse process.\\n\\n**2.2. Reverse (Denoising) Process:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Model Architecture:** What neural network architecture is used (e.g., U-Net for images, Transformer for sequences, or specialized architectures for other data types)? Is it appropriate for the data modality and complexity? Does it leverage techniques like skip connections, attention mechanisms, or spectral normalization where relevant?\\n    *   **Prediction Target:** What does the network predict?\\n        *   Noise ($\\\\epsilon_t$ as in DDPM): A common and stable choice.\\n        *   Mean ($\\\\mu_\\\\theta(x_t, t)$): Directly predicts the denoised mean.\\n        *   Score Function ($\\\\nabla_{x_t} \\\\log p(x_t)$ as in Score-Based Generative Models): Requires careful handling of different noise levels.\\n        *   Combined (e.g., predicting both mean and variance): More complex but potentially more flexible.\\n        *   Is the choice of prediction target well-motivated and consistent with the theoretical derivation of the reverse process (e.g., derived from the variational lower bound)?\\n    *   **Parameterization of Variance:** Is the variance of the reverse step fixed, learned by the network, or set to a specific value (e.g., $\\\\tilde{\\\\beta}_t$ in DDPM)? A learned variance can sometimes improve sample quality but adds complexity.\\n    *   **Latent Diffusion (if applicable):** If the model operates in a latent space (e.g., Stable Diffusion), how is the VAE/Autoencoder designed and trained? Is the compression effective without losing critical information, and does it reduce the dimensionality sufficiently to improve efficiency? Is the VAE training method robust?\\n\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   **Model Size and Complexity:** A larger, deeper model generally means longer training and inference times. Is the chosen model size justified by the complexity of the data and desired quality, or could a smaller model suffice?\\n    *   **Computational Bottlenecks:** Are there specific architectural choices that lead to high memory or computational costs (e.g., very large attention blocks, high-resolution processing in pixel space for too long)?\\n    *   **Optimization Techniques:** Are techniques like mixed-precision training, gradient accumulation, or checkpointing used to manage memory during training?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Loss Functions**\\n\\n**3.1. Primary Loss Function:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Theoretical Basis:** Is the loss function directly derived from the variational lower bound (VLB) or a score matching objective? For DDPM, the simplified L2 loss on the predicted noise ($\\\\mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \\\\epsilon} [||\\\\epsilon - \\\\epsilon_\\\\theta(x_t, t)||^2]$) is a common and robust choice, which is shown to be a valid surrogate for the VLB.\\n    *   **Consistency:** Is the loss function consistent with the chosen prediction target of the reverse process?\\n    *   **Weighting:** Is there a weighting scheme applied across different timesteps (e.g., $1/\\\\alpha_t$ in some formulations)? Is this weighting justified and does it empirically improve results?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   Standard L2 loss is computationally efficient. More complex losses (e.g., perceptual, adversarial) add overhead.\\n\\n**3.2. Auxiliary Loss Functions (if any):**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Motivation:** Are auxiliary losses (e.g., perceptual losses, adversarial losses, consistency losses for Consistency Models, classifier guidance losses) well-motivated? Do they aim to address specific limitations (e.g., improve perceptual quality, speed up sampling)?\\n    *   **Balancing:** If multiple losses are used, how are they weighted and balanced? Is there an ablation study demonstrating the contribution of each auxiliary loss?\\n    *   **Stability:** Do they introduce training instability (e.g., mode collapse with adversarial losses)?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   Each additional loss term adds computational overhead during training. Perceptual losses, for instance, require forward passes through another (often large) neural network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Sampling Techniques**\\n\\n**4.1. Generative Process / Inference:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Mathematical Derivation:** Is the sampling procedure correctly derived from the learned reverse process?\\n    *   **Stochastic vs. Deterministic:**\\n        *   **DDPM (Stochastic):** Follows the original reverse process with added noise. Is the noise correctly sampled (e.g., Gaussian)?\\n        *   **DDIM (Deterministic):** A popular choice for faster, deterministic sampling. Is its derivation (non-Markovian reverse process) correctly implemented? Does it allow for fewer sampling steps?\\n        *   **ODE/SDE Solvers:** For continuous-time diffusion models (e.g., DPM-Solver, UniPC). Are the chosen solvers (e.g., Euler, Runge-Kutta, predictor-corrector) appropriate, and are their step sizes handled correctly?\\n        *   **Consistency Models:** Are the one-step or few-step sampling strategies correctly applied based on the consistency property?\\n    *   **Guidance Mechanisms:**\\n        *   **Classifier Guidance:** If used, how is the classifier trained? Is the guidance term correctly applied?\\n        *   **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG):** A widely adopted technique for controllable generation. Is it correctly implemented by blending conditional and unconditional scores? How is the guidance scale chosen? Is it stable?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   **Number of Sampling Steps (N_steps):** This is the primary determinant of inference speed.\\n        *   Does the paper propose methods to significantly reduce `N_steps` while maintaining quality? (e.g., DDIM, DPM-Solver, Consistency Models, LCMs).\\n        *   Are there qualitative and quantitative evaluations showing quality vs. step count tradeoffs?\\n    *   **Computational Cost per Step:** While often dominated by `N_steps`, the complexity of the forward pass through the denoising network also matters.\\n    *   **Memory Footprint:** The memory required for storing intermediate tensors during sampling.\\n    *   **Batching:** Can sampling be efficiently batched on hardware?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**5. Overall Correctness Assessment**\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Soundness:**\\n    *   Are all mathematical derivations provided and correct?\\n    *   Are all assumptions clearly stated and justified?\\n    *   Does the proposed method logically follow from its theoretical foundation?\\n*   **Implementation Details:**\\n    *   Are the implementation details (e.g., normalization, scaling, initializers, optimizers, learning rate schedules) clearly described and consistent with best practices for training large neural networks?\\n    *   Are hyperparameter choices justified, possibly with ablation studies?\\n*   **Experimental Validation:**\\n    *   **Benchmarks:** Are standard datasets and evaluation metrics used? (e.g., FID, Inception Score for images; Fr\u00e9chet Audio Distance for audio; perplexity/human evaluation for text).\\n    *   **Baselines:** Are state-of-the-art diffusion models and other generative models (GANs, VAEs) included as baselines for comparison?\\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** Are sufficient ablation studies performed to demonstrate the contribution of each novel component of the proposed method?\\n    *   **Qualitative Results:** Are qualitative samples provided and do they demonstrate the claimed improvements? Are failure modes or limitations discussed?\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Is enough detail provided for the work to be reproduced by others (e.g., model weights, code, detailed hyperparameter settings)?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**6.

Executive Summary\\n\\nVision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful feature extractors, surpassing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in many computer vision tasks. Their global attention mechanism provides a unique advantage in capturing long-range dependencies, which is particularly relevant for abstract concepts like \\\"style.\\\" This report assesses the effectiveness of ViT features for disentangling style and content in images.\\n\\nWhile ViTs do not inherently guarantee disentangled representations, their capacity for learning rich, semantically meaningful features makes them highly promising candidates. When integrated into specific disentanglement frameworks (e.g., VAEs, GANs, or through contrastive learning), ViT features significantly enhance the quality of disentanglement, leading to more realistic style transfer, improved attribute manipulation, and better generalization. However, achieving perfect, interpretable disentanglement remains a complex challenge, often limited by the ambiguity of \\\"style\\\" and \\\"content\\\" definitions and the lack of robust quantitative metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Introduction: The Challenge of Disentanglement\\n\\nDisentangled representation learning aims to decompose the underlying explanatory factors of variation in data into independent, interpretable dimensions within a latent space. For images, a common goal is to separate \\\"content\\\" (e.g., object identity, pose, semantic layout) from \\\"style\\\" (e.g., textures, colors, artistic brushstrokes, lighting, artistic domain).\\n\\nTraditionally, CNNs have been used as encoders in disentanglement frameworks. While effective, their local receptive fields and hierarchical processing can sometimes entangle global style characteristics with local content features. The advent of ViTs, with their global attention mechanism, offers a new paradigm for feature extraction, potentially overcoming some of these limitations.\\n\\n### 3. Theoretical Basis: Why ViTs are Promising for Disentanglement\\n\\nViTs process images by first splitting them into patches, which are then linearly embedded and processed by a series of Transformer encoder blocks. Key properties that make ViTs suitable for disentanglement include:\\n\\n*   **Global Receptive Field:** Unlike CNNs, where information aggregates hierarchically, every patch embedding in a ViT can attend to every other patch embedding from the very first layer. This global view is crucial for capturing holistic image properties such as overall color palette, lighting conditions, artistic style (e.g., impressionistic vs. cubist), or global textures, which are inherently \\\"style\\\" attributes.\\n*   **Self-Attention Mechanism:** The self-attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different image regions. This can potentially lead to:\\n    *   **Content Concentration:** Attention heads might focus on distinct objects or semantic regions, implicitly grouping features related to \\\"what\\\" is in the image.\\n    *   **Style Aggregation:** Other attention heads might focus on non-local patterns or statistical regularities across patches that define the \\\"how\\\" an image looks (its style).\\n*   **Learned Positional Embeddings:** While patches are processed independently initially, positional embeddings allow the model to retain spatial information, which is critical for content representation.\\n*   **Strong Pre-trained Features:** Large-scale pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet-21K, JFT-300M, or through self-supervised methods like DINO, MAE, or CLIP) enables ViTs to learn highly robust and semantically rich representations. These representations often implicitly separate high-level concepts, making them excellent starting points for disentanglement. For instance, DINO ViTs are known to produce attention maps that segment objects without explicit supervision, hinting at an inherent ability to localize content. CLIP's ViT-based visual encoder, trained on vast image-text pairs, excels at capturing abstract visual concepts and styles that align with textual descriptions.\\n\\n### 4. Methodologies for Utilizing ViT Features\\n\\nResearchers leverage ViT features for disentanglement in several ways:\\n\\n1.  **ViT as an Encoder in Generative Models:**\\n    *   **ViT-VAE/GAN:** The most common approach involves using a pre-trained or fine-tuned ViT as the encoder within a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The ViT extracts features, which are then passed to a latent space designed for disentanglement (e.g., with specific regularization losses like $\\\\beta$-VAE or FactorVAE loss). Separate decoders might then reconstruct the image from independent style and content latent codes.\\n    *   **Latent Code Manipulation:** Once the latent space is learned, specific dimensions (or groups of dimensions) are identified and manipulated to control style or content independently, demonstrating disentanglement.\\n\\n2.  **Attention-based Disentanglement:**\\n    *   Some works attempt to analyze or modify the ViT's internal attention mechanisms directly. For example, specific attention heads or layers might be hypothesized to capture more style-related or content-related information. Techniques might involve separating attention outputs or training separate \\\"style attention\\\" and \\\"content attention\\\" modules.\\n\\n3.  **Contrastive Learning for Disentanglement:**\\n    *   Inspired by methods like InfoNCE, ViT features can be trained with contrastive losses to explicitly maximize mutual information between different views of content while minimizing it across different styles, or vice-versa. This can involve creating pairs of images with shared content but different styles, or vice-versa, to guide the ViT towards separating these factors in its latent space.\\n\\n4.  **Hybrid Architectures:**\\n    *   Combining ViTs with CNNs: Some approaches use CNNs for initial low-level feature extraction (often associated with detailed content) and then a ViT for global context and style, or vice versa, leveraging the strengths of both architectures.\\n\\n### 5. Quality of Disentanglement and Overall Results\\n\\nThe quality of disentanglement using ViT features is generally high, particularly when compared to purely CNN-based approaches, though it still faces inherent challenges.\\n\\n#### 5.1 Qualitative Assessment:\\n\\n*   **Style Transfer:** ViT-powered models often achieve more visually convincing and realistic style transfer results. The global understanding of style allows for more coherent application of artistic elements across the entire image, rather than merely local texture transfer. For instance, transferring the style of a specific painter (e.g., Van Gogh's brushstrokes and color palette) can be more accurately replicated.\\n*   **Attribute Manipulation:** In tasks like facial attribute editing (e.g., changing hair color, adding glasses while preserving identity), ViT-based generative models show improved ability to modify specific attributes without affecting unrelated features, indicating a degree of disentanglement.\\n*   **Domain Adaptation:** ViT features enable better generalization across domains (e.g., real photos to paintings, daytime to nighttime) by disentangling domain-specific style from semantic content.\\n*   **Improved Controllability:** The latent spaces learned with ViT encoders often allow for more intuitive and semantic manipulation of image properties, providing finer-grained control over generation.\\n\\n#### 5.2 Quantitative Assessment:\\n\\n*   **Metrics for Generation Quality:** Standard metrics like FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and IS (Inception Score) often show improvements when ViT features are incorporated into generative models, indicating higher fidelity and diversity of generated images. While these don't directly measure disentanglement, better generation quality often correlates with a more structured and disentangled latent space.\\n*   **Disentanglement Specific Metrics (Challenges):** Traditional disentanglement metrics (e.g., MIG, FactorVAE, Beta-VAE metrics) are designed for datasets where ground-truth generative factors are known and independently controllable (e.g., 3D shapes datasets). For style and content in real-world images, such ground truth is largely unavailable and subjective. Therefore, direct quantitative evaluation of disentanglement remains challenging. Proxy metrics or human evaluation are often used.\\n*   **Limitations:**\\n    *   **Ambiguity of Style/Content:** The subjective nature of defining \\\"style\\\" and \\\"content\\\" makes ground truth labeling impossible and objective evaluation difficult. A specific feature might be considered content by one person and style by another (e.g., the specific type of brushstroke for a specific artist).\\n    *   **Entanglement persists:** Even with ViTs, perfect disentanglement is rarely achieved. Some level of entanglement between style and content features is almost inevitable due to their inherent co-occurrence in real-world data.\\n    *   **Requires Specific Training Objectives:** Vanilla ViTs, trained for classification or reconstruction, do not inherently disentangle. Specialized architectures, loss functions (e.g., adversarial disentanglement, mutual information maximization, or explicit style/content separation losses), and dataset augmentation strategies (e.g., mixing and matching styles/contents) are crucial to guide the ViT towards disentangled representations.\\n\\n### 6. Overall Results and Impact\\n\\nThe integration of ViT features has undeniably pushed the boundaries of style and content disentanglement:\\n\\n*   **More Sophisticated Representations:** ViTs provide a richer, more abstract, and globally aware feature set than CNNs, leading to more meaningful latent spaces for disentanglement.\\n*   **Enhanced Generative Control:** Applications in image synthesis, manipulation, and editing have seen significant improvements in terms of controllability and realism.\\n*   **Improved Generalization:** The robust features learned by pre-trained ViTs contribute to better generalization of disentangled models across diverse datasets and tasks.\\n*   **Foundation for Future Research:** ViTs open avenues for exploring causal disentanglement and understanding the underlying generative factors in complex visual data.\\n\\n### 7. Future Directions and Open Questions\\n\\n1.  **Purpose-Built ViT Architectures for Disentanglement:** Designing ViT variants specifically optimized for disentanglement, perhaps by separating attention heads or layers that primarily focus on style vs. content.\\n2.  **Better Disentanglement Metrics:** Developing quantitative metrics tailored for evaluating style-content disentanglement in real-world images, potentially leveraging perceptual similarity metrics or human evaluation at scale.\\n3.  **Leveraging Large-Scale Multi-modal Pre-training:** Further exploration of features from models like CLIP and DALL-E 2/3 (which leverage ViTs) for their inherent disentangling capabilities, especially concerning abstract concepts.\\n4.  **Causal Disentanglement:** Moving beyond statistical independence to identify and separate causal factors, which would provide more robust and transferable disentangled representations.\\n5.  **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks:** Investigating how disentangled ViT features perform under adversarial conditions and if disentanglement can improve robustness.\\n\\n### 8. Conclusion\\n\\nViT features represent a significant leap forward in the pursuit of style and content disentanglement. Their global attention mechanism, combined with the power of large-scale pre-training, enables them to capture complex, holistic style attributes and robust content representations that were challenging for previous architectures.\\n\\nWhile not inherently disentangled, when integrated into carefully designed frameworks with specific loss functions, ViT features demonstrably improve the quality, realism, and controllability of disentangled representations. The primary evidence lies in impressive qualitative results in tasks like style transfer and attribute manipulation. However, the subjective nature of \\\"style\\\" and \\\"content\\\" and the lack of universal quantitative metrics remain significant hurdles. Continued research into purpose-built ViT architectures, novel training objectives, and more robust evaluation methods will further unlock the full potential of ViT features for achieving truly interpretable and disentangled visual representations.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.81139275\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ViTDisentanglementAnalyst\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Assess the use of ViT features for disentangling style and content.

Introduction**\\n\\nThis report provides a general framework for evaluating the technical soundness of a diffusion model presented in a research paper. Without the specific paper, this evaluation will focus on the common elements, best practices, and potential pitfalls in diffusion model design, training, and inference. The aim is to provide a structured approach to assess the correctness of the theoretical foundations, the robustness of the implementation details, and the efficiency of the proposed method.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Diffusion Model Architecture and Formulation**\\n\\n**2.1. Forward (Diffusion) Process:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Mathematical Formulation:** Is the forward process clearly defined? Is it a fixed Markov chain (as in DDPM/SDEs)? Are the noise addition steps (e.g., Gaussian noise) mathematically sound?\\n    *   **Variance Schedule:** Is the choice of variance schedule ($\\\\beta_t$ or $\\\\alpha_t$) justified? Common choices include linear, cosine (DDPM), or more complex learned schedules. A well-chosen schedule ensures stable diffusion to pure noise and good signal-to-noise ratio throughout the process.\\n    *   **Assumptions:** Are any underlying assumptions (e.g., data distribution assumptions, independence of noise) explicitly stated and consistent with the chosen formulation?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   The forward process is typically fixed and not learned, so its direct computational cost is minimal during training. However, its design influences the complexity of the reverse process.\\n\\n**2.2. Reverse (Denoising) Process:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Model Architecture:** What neural network architecture is used (e.g., U-Net for images, Transformer for sequences, or specialized architectures for other data types)? Is it appropriate for the data modality and complexity? Does it leverage techniques like skip connections, attention mechanisms, or spectral normalization where relevant?\\n    *   **Prediction Target:** What does the network predict?\\n        *   Noise ($\\\\epsilon_t$ as in DDPM): A common and stable choice.\\n        *   Mean ($\\\\mu_\\\\theta(x_t, t)$): Directly predicts the denoised mean.\\n        *   Score Function ($\\\\nabla_{x_t} \\\\log p(x_t)$ as in Score-Based Generative Models): Requires careful handling of different noise levels.\\n        *   Combined (e.g., predicting both mean and variance): More complex but potentially more flexible.\\n        *   Is the choice of prediction target well-motivated and consistent with the theoretical derivation of the reverse process (e.g., derived from the variational lower bound)?\\n    *   **Parameterization of Variance:** Is the variance of the reverse step fixed, learned by the network, or set to a specific value (e.g., $\\\\tilde{\\\\beta}_t$ in DDPM)? A learned variance can sometimes improve sample quality but adds complexity.\\n    *   **Latent Diffusion (if applicable):** If the model operates in a latent space (e.g., Stable Diffusion), how is the VAE/Autoencoder designed and trained? Is the compression effective without losing critical information, and does it reduce the dimensionality sufficiently to improve efficiency? Is the VAE training method robust?\\n\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   **Model Size and Complexity:** A larger, deeper model generally means longer training and inference times. Is the chosen model size justified by the complexity of the data and desired quality, or could a smaller model suffice?\\n    *   **Computational Bottlenecks:** Are there specific architectural choices that lead to high memory or computational costs (e.g., very large attention blocks, high-resolution processing in pixel space for too long)?\\n    *   **Optimization Techniques:** Are techniques like mixed-precision training, gradient accumulation, or checkpointing used to manage memory during training?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Loss Functions**\\n\\n**3.1. Primary Loss Function:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Theoretical Basis:** Is the loss function directly derived from the variational lower bound (VLB) or a score matching objective? For DDPM, the simplified L2 loss on the predicted noise ($\\\\mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \\\\epsilon} [||\\\\epsilon - \\\\epsilon_\\\\theta(x_t, t)||^2]$) is a common and robust choice, which is shown to be a valid surrogate for the VLB.\\n    *   **Consistency:** Is the loss function consistent with the chosen prediction target of the reverse process?\\n    *   **Weighting:** Is there a weighting scheme applied across different timesteps (e.g., $1/\\\\alpha_t$ in some formulations)? Is this weighting justified and does it empirically improve results?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   Standard L2 loss is computationally efficient. More complex losses (e.g., perceptual, adversarial) add overhead.\\n\\n**3.2. Auxiliary Loss Functions (if any):**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Motivation:** Are auxiliary losses (e.g., perceptual losses, adversarial losses, consistency losses for Consistency Models, classifier guidance losses) well-motivated? Do they aim to address specific limitations (e.g., improve perceptual quality, speed up sampling)?\\n    *   **Balancing:** If multiple losses are used, how are they weighted and balanced? Is there an ablation study demonstrating the contribution of each auxiliary loss?\\n    *   **Stability:** Do they introduce training instability (e.g., mode collapse with adversarial losses)?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   Each additional loss term adds computational overhead during training. Perceptual losses, for instance, require forward passes through another (often large) neural network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. Sampling Techniques**\\n\\n**4.1. Generative Process / Inference:**\\n*   **Correctness:**\\n    *   **Mathematical Derivation:** Is the sampling procedure correctly derived from the learned reverse process?\\n    *   **Stochastic vs. Deterministic:**\\n        *   **DDPM (Stochastic):** Follows the original reverse process with added noise. Is the noise correctly sampled (e.g., Gaussian)?\\n        *   **DDIM (Deterministic):** A popular choice for faster, deterministic sampling. Is its derivation (non-Markovian reverse process) correctly implemented? Does it allow for fewer sampling steps?\\n        *   **ODE/SDE Solvers:** For continuous-time diffusion models (e.g., DPM-Solver, UniPC). Are the chosen solvers (e.g., Euler, Runge-Kutta, predictor-corrector) appropriate, and are their step sizes handled correctly?\\n        *   **Consistency Models:** Are the one-step or few-step sampling strategies correctly applied based on the consistency property?\\n    *   **Guidance Mechanisms:**\\n        *   **Classifier Guidance:** If used, how is the classifier trained? Is the guidance term correctly applied?\\n        *   **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG):** A widely adopted technique for controllable generation. Is it correctly implemented by blending conditional and unconditional scores? How is the guidance scale chosen? Is it stable?\\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:**\\n    *   **Number of Sampling Steps (N_steps):** This is the primary determinant of inference speed.\\n        *   Does the paper propose methods to significantly reduce `N_steps` while maintaining quality? (e.g., DDIM, DPM-Solver, Consistency Models, LCMs).\\n        *   Are there qualitative and quantitative evaluations showing quality vs. step count tradeoffs?\\n    *   **Computational Cost per Step:** While often dominated by `N_steps`, the complexity of the forward pass through the denoising network also matters.\\n    *   **Memory Footprint:** The memory required for storing intermediate tensors during sampling.\\n    *   **Batching:** Can sampling be efficiently batched on hardware?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**5.

Executive Summary\\n\\nVision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful feature extractors, surpassing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in many computer vision tasks. Their global attention mechanism provides a unique advantage in capturing long-range dependencies, which is particularly relevant for abstract concepts like \"style.\" This report assesses the effectiveness of ViT features for disentangling style and content in images.\\n\\nWhile ViTs do not inherently guarantee disentangled representations, their capacity for learning rich, semantically meaningful features makes them highly promising candidates. When integrated into specific disentanglement frameworks (e.g., VAEs, GANs, or through contrastive learning), ViT features significantly enhance the quality of disentanglement, leading to more realistic style transfer, improved attribute manipulation, and better generalization. However, achieving perfect, interpretable disentanglement remains a complex challenge, often limited by the ambiguity of \"style\" and \"content\" definitions and the lack of robust quantitative metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Introduction: The Challenge of Disentanglement\\n\\nDisentangled representation learning aims to decompose the underlying explanatory factors of variation in data into independent, interpretable dimensions within a latent space. For images, a common goal is to separate \"content\" (e.g., object identity, pose, semantic layout) from \"style\" (e.g., textures, colors, artistic brushstrokes, lighting, artistic domain).\\n\\nTraditionally, CNNs have been used as encoders in disentanglement frameworks. While effective, their local receptive fields and hierarchical processing can sometimes entangle global style characteristics with local content features. The advent of ViTs, with their global attention mechanism, offers a new paradigm for feature extraction, potentially overcoming some of these limitations.\\n\\n### 3. Theoretical Basis: Why ViTs are Promising for Disentanglement\\n\\nViTs process images by first splitting them into patches, which are then linearly embedded and processed by a series of Transformer encoder blocks. Key properties that make ViTs suitable for disentanglement include:\\n\\n*   **Global Receptive Field:** Unlike CNNs, where information aggregates hierarchically, every patch embedding in a ViT can attend to every other patch embedding from the very first layer. This global view is crucial for capturing holistic image properties such as overall color palette, lighting conditions, artistic style (e.g., impressionistic vs. cubist), or global textures, which are inherently \"style\" attributes.\\n*   **Self-Attention Mechanism:** The self-attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different image regions. This can potentially lead to:\\n    *   **Content Concentration:** Attention heads might focus on distinct objects or semantic regions, implicitly grouping features related to \"what\" is in the image.\\n    *   **Style Aggregation:** Other attention heads might focus on non-local patterns or statistical regularities across patches that define the \"how\" an image looks (its style).\\n*   **Learned Positional Embeddings:** While patches are processed independently initially, positional embeddings allow the model to retain spatial information, which is critical for content representation.\\n*   **Strong Pre-trained Features:** Large-scale pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet-21K, JFT-300M, or through self-supervised methods like DINO, MAE, or CLIP) enables ViTs to learn highly robust and semantically rich representations. These representations often implicitly separate high-level concepts, making them excellent starting points for disentanglement. For instance, DINO ViTs are known to produce attention maps that segment objects without explicit supervision, hinting at an inherent ability to localize content. CLIP\\'s ViT-based visual encoder, trained on vast image-text pairs, excels at capturing abstract visual concepts and styles that align with textual descriptions.\\n\\n### 4. Methodologies for Utilizing ViT Features\\n\\nResearchers leverage ViT features for disentanglement in several ways:\\n\\n1.  **ViT as an Encoder in Generative Models:**\\n    *   **ViT-VAE/GAN:** The most common approach involves using a pre-trained or fine-tuned ViT as the encoder within a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The ViT extracts features, which are then passed to a latent space designed for disentanglement (e.g., with specific regularization losses like $\\\\beta$-VAE or FactorVAE loss). Separate decoders might then reconstruct the image from independent style and content latent codes.\\n    *   **Latent Code Manipulation:** Once the latent space is learned, specific dimensions (or groups of dimensions) are identified and manipulated to control style or content independently, demonstrating disentanglement.\\n\\n2.  **Attention-based Disentanglement:**\\n    *   Some works attempt to analyze or modify the ViT\\'s internal attention mechanisms directly. For example, specific attention heads or layers might be hypothesized to capture more style-related or content-related information. Techniques might involve separating attention outputs or training separate \"style attention\" and \"content attention\" modules.\\n\\n3.  **Contrastive Learning for Disentanglement:**\\n    *   Inspired by methods like InfoNCE, ViT features can be trained with contrastive losses to explicitly maximize mutual information between different views of content while minimizing it across different styles, or vice-versa. This can involve creating pairs of images with shared content but different styles, or vice-versa, to guide the ViT towards separating these factors in its latent space.\\n\\n4.  **Hybrid Architectures:**\\n    *   Combining ViTs with CNNs: Some approaches use CNNs for initial low-level feature extraction (often associated with detailed content) and then a ViT for global context and style, or vice versa, leveraging the strengths of both architectures.\\n\\n### 5. Quality of Disentanglement and Overall Results\\n\\nThe quality of disentanglement using ViT features is generally high, particularly when compared to purely CNN-based approaches, though it still faces inherent challenges.\\n\\n#### 5.1 Qualitative Assessment:\\n\\n*   **Style Transfer:** ViT-powered models often achieve more visually convincing and realistic style transfer results. The global understanding of style allows for more coherent application of artistic elements across the entire image, rather than merely local texture transfer. For instance, transferring the style of a specific painter (e.g., Van Gogh\\'s brushstrokes and color palette) can be more accurately replicated.\\n*   **Attribute Manipulation:** In tasks like facial attribute editing (e.g., changing hair color, adding glasses while preserving identity), ViT-based generative models show improved ability to modify specific attributes without affecting unrelated features, indicating a degree of disentanglement.\\n*   **Domain Adaptation:** ViT features enable better generalization across domains (e.g., real photos to paintings, daytime to nighttime) by disentangling domain-specific style from semantic content.\\n*   **Improved Controllability:** The latent spaces learned with ViT encoders often allow for more intuitive and semantic manipulation of image properties, providing finer-grained control over generation.\\n\\n#### 5.2 Quantitative Assessment:\\n\\n*   **Metrics for Generation Quality:** Standard metrics like FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and IS (Inception Score) often show improvements when ViT features are incorporated into generative models, indicating higher fidelity and diversity of generated images. While these don\\'t directly measure disentanglement, better generation quality often correlates with a more structured and disentangled latent space.\\n*   **Disentanglement Specific Metrics (Challenges):** Traditional disentanglement metrics (e.g., MIG, FactorVAE, Beta-VAE metrics) are designed for datasets where ground-truth generative factors are known and independently controllable (e.g., 3D shapes datasets). For style and content in real-world images, such ground truth is largely unavailable and subjective. Therefore, direct quantitative evaluation of disentanglement remains challenging. Proxy metrics or human evaluation are often used.\\n*   **Limitations:**\\n    *   **Ambiguity of Style/Content:** The subjective nature of defining \"style\" and \"content\" makes ground truth labeling impossible and objective evaluation difficult. A specific feature might be considered content by one person and style by another (e.g., the specific type of brushstroke for a specific artist).\\n    *   **Entanglement persists:** Even with ViTs, perfect disentanglement is rarely achieved. Some level of entanglement between style and content features is almost inevitable due to their inherent co-occurrence in real-world data.\\n    *   **Requires Specific Training Objectives:** Vanilla ViTs, trained for classification or reconstruction, do not inherently disentangle. Specialized architectures, loss functions (e.g., adversarial disentanglement, mutual information maximization, or explicit style/content separation losses), and dataset augmentation strategies (e.g., mixing and matching styles/contents) are crucial to guide the ViT towards disentangled representations.\\n\\n### 6. Overall Results and Impact\\n\\nThe integration of ViT features has undeniably pushed the boundaries of style and content disentanglement:\\n\\n*   **More Sophisticated Representations:** ViTs provide a richer, more abstract, and globally aware feature set than CNNs, leading to more meaningful latent spaces for disentanglement.\\n*   **Enhanced Generative Control:** Applications in image synthesis, manipulation, and editing have seen significant improvements in terms of controllability and realism.\\n*   **Improved Generalization:** The robust features learned by pre-trained ViTs contribute to better generalization of disentangled models across diverse datasets and tasks.\\n*   **Foundation for Future Research:** ViTs open avenues for exploring causal disentanglement and understanding the underlying generative factors in complex visual data.\\n\\n### 7. Future Directions and Open Questions\\n\\n1.  **Purpose-Built ViT Architectures for Disentanglement:** Designing ViT variants specifically optimized for disentanglement, perhaps by separating attention heads or layers that primarily focus on style vs. content.\\n2.  **Better Disentanglement Metrics:** Developing quantitative metrics tailored for evaluating style-content disentanglement in real-world images, potentially leveraging perceptual similarity metrics or human evaluation at scale.\\n3.  **Leveraging Large-Scale Multi-modal Pre-training:** Further exploration of features from models like CLIP and DALL-E 2/3 (which leverage ViTs) for their inherent disentangling capabilities, especially concerning abstract concepts.\\n4.  **Causal Disentanglement:** Moving beyond statistical independence to identify and separate causal factors, which would provide more robust and transferable disentangled representations.\\n5.  **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks:** Investigating how disentangled ViT features perform under adversarial conditions and if disentanglement can improve robustness.\\n\\n### 8. Conclusion\\n\\nViT features represent a significant leap forward in the pursuit of style and content disentanglement. Their global attention mechanism, combined with the power of large-scale pre-training, enables them to capture complex, holistic style attributes and robust content representations that were challenging for previous architectures.\\n\\nWhile not inherently disentangled, when integrated into carefully designed frameworks with specific loss functions, ViT features demonstrably improve the quality, realism, and controllability of disentangled representations. The primary evidence lies in impressive qualitative results in tasks like style transfer and attribute manipulation. However, the subjective nature of \"style\" and \"content\" and the lack of universal quantitative metrics remain significant hurdles. Continued research into purpose-built ViT architectures, novel training objectives, and more robust evaluation methods will further unlock the full potential of ViT features for achieving truly interpretable and disentangled visual representations.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.81139275}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Step 5: Collaborative Review Discussion and Consensus Building**\n\nI will now synthesize the agent reviews into a comprehensive assessment.\n\n*   **Diffusion Model Expert (DME):** The DME report provides a detailed framework for evaluating the technical soundness of diffusion models.
