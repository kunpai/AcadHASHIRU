GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Proactive Multi-Camera Collaboration for 3D Human Pose Estimation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Marker-less motion capture (MoCap) has broad commercial applications in many areas such as cinematography, medical research, virtual reality (VR), sports, and etc. Their successes can be partly attributed to recent developments in 3D Human pose estimation (HPE) techniques (Tu et al., 2020; Iskakov et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Jafarian et al., 2019; Pavlakos et al., 2017b; Dong et al., 2019; Lin & Lee, 2021b). A straightforward implementation to solve multi-views 3D HPE is to use fixed cameras. Although being a convenient solution, it is less effective against dynamic occlusions. Moreover, fixed camera solutions confine tracking targets within a constrained space, therefore less applicable to outdoor MoCap. On the contrary, active cameras such as ones mounted on drones can maneuver proactively against incoming occlusions. Owing to its remarkable flexibility, the active approach has thus attracted overwhelming interest (Tallamraju et al., 2020; Ho et al., 2021; N\u00e4geli et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2017; Kiciroglu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018; Saini et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). Previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of using active cameras for 3D HPE on a single target in indoor (Kiciroglu et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2018), clean landscapes (Tallamraju et al., 2020; N\u00e4geli et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Saini et al., 2022) or landscapes with scattered static obstacles (Ho et al., 2021). However, to our best knowledge, we have not seen any existing work that experimented with multiple (n > 3) active cameras to conduct 3D HPE in human crowd. There are two key challenges : First, frequent human-to-human interactions lead to random dynamic occlusions. Different from previous works that only consider clean landscapes or static obstacles, dynamic scenes require frequent adjustments of cameras\u2019 viewpoints for occlusion avoidance while keeping an overall good team formation for multi-view reconstruction. Therefore, it is challenging to achieve optimality with a fixed camera formation or a hand-crafted control policy. In addition, the complex behavioral pattern of a human crowd makes the occlusion patterns less comprehensible and predictable, further increasing the difficulty in control. Second, as the size of a camera team grows, the multi-agent credit assignment issue becomes prominent which hinders policy learning of the camera agents. Concretely, as a team effort, multi-view 3D HPE requires inputs from multiple cameras to generate an accurate reconstruction. Having more camera agents participate in a reconstruction introduces more redundancy. Though it reduces the susceptibility to reconstruction failure caused by dynamic occlusions, it consequently weakens the association between the individual performance and the reconstruction accuracy of the team, which likely leads to the \u201clazy agent\u201d problem (Sunehag et al., 2017). A shared reward risks disincentivizing some individual cameras on exploring better viewpoints due to an adequate accuracy already being attained by their teammates alone. We introduce a proactive multi-camera collaboration framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for real-time distributive adjustments of multi-camera formation for 3D HPE in a human crowd. In our approach, multiple camera agents perform seamless collaboration for successful reconstructions of 3D human poses. Additionally, it is a decentralized framework which offers flexibility over the size of formation and eliminates dependency to a control hierarchy or a centralized entity. In regards of the first challenge, we argue the utmost importance of the model\u2019s capability to anticipate human motions and future states of the environment. To model these properties into the state representations, we incorporate World Dynamics Learning into the training of our model, i.e., learning with five auxiliary tasks to predict target\u2019s position, pedestrians\u2019 positions, self state, teammates\u2019 states and team reward. To tackle the second challenge, we further introduce the Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR), which incentivizes each agent according to its characteristic contribution to a 3D reconstruction. Inspired by the Shapley Value (Rapoport, 1970), CTCR computes the average weighted marginal contribution to the 3D reconstruction for any given agent over all possible coalitions that contain it. This reward aims to directly associate agents\u2019 levels of participation with their return and guides their policy learning when the team reward alone is insufficient to produce such direct association. Moreover, CTCR penalizes occluded camera agents more efficiently than the shared reward, encouraging emergent occlusion avoidance behaviors. Empirical results show that CTCR can accelerate convergence and increase reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, CTCR is a general approach that can benefit policy learning in active 3D HPE and serve as a new assessment metric for view selection in other multi-view reconstruction tasks. In experiments, we build photo-realistic environments based on Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and UnrealCV (Qiu et al., 2017) for training and testing. Our environments can simulate realistic-behaving crowds with assurances of high fidelity and customizability. We train the agents on a Blank environment and validate the generalizability on three unseen scenarios with different landscapes, levels of illumination, human appearances, and various quantities of cameras and humans. The empirical results show that our method can achieve more accurate and stable 3D pose estimates than off-the-shelf passive- and active-camera baselines. To help facilitate more fruitful research on this topic, we will open-source our environments that are integrated with OpenAI Gym-API (Brockman et al., 2016) and together with a dedicated visualization tool. Here we summarize the key contributions of our work:1 \u2022 We formulate active 3D human pose estimation in a human crowd problem as a Dec-POMDP, and proposed a novel multi-camera (n \u2265 3) collaboration framework. \u2022 We propose CTCR to improve credit assignment in multi-camera collaboration and demonstrate notable improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to both passive and active baselines. \u2022 We introduce five auxiliary tasks called to help the model learn environment dynamics, further enhancing the model\u2019s ability to handle highly dynamic scenes. \u2022 We contribute high-fidelity environments built for simulating realistic-looking human crowds with authentic behaviors, along with visualization software for frame-by-frame video analysis. 1Project Website for demo videos: https://sites.google.com/view/active3dpose/home 2 RELATED WORK: 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) Recent works demonstrated recovering 3D human pose from a single monocular image (Ma et al., 2021; Pavlakos et al., 2017a; Martinez et al., 2017; Kanazawa et al., 2018; Pavlakos et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018; Ci et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2020; Ci et al., 2020) or monocular video (Mehta et al., 2017; Hossain & Little, 2018; Pavllo et al., 2019; Kocabas et al., 2020). Another line of work utilized multi-camera systems (i.e. triangulation) to eliminate ambiguity and provide redundancy to visibility (Qiu et al., 2019; Jafarian et al., 2019; Pavlakos et al., 2017b; Dong et al., 2019; Lin & Lee, 2021b; Tu et al., 2020; Iskakov et al., 2019). However, these multi-view methods are limited to the indoor laboratory environment with fixed cameras. This work presents an active camera system with multiple mobile cameras for mocap in outdoor scenes. Proactive Motion Capture Few previous works studied proactive motion capture with a single mobile camera (Zhou et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2018; Kiciroglu et al., 2019). In comparison, more works studied the control of a multi-camera team. Among them, many are based on optimization with various system designs, including marker-based (N\u00e4geli et al., 2018), RGBD-based (Xu et al., 2017), two-stage system (Saini et al., 2019; Tallamraju et al., 2019), hierarchical system (Ho et al., 2021), etc. It is important to note that all the above methods deal with static occlusion sources or clean landscapes. Also, the common similarity shared by these works is the use of hand-crafted optimization objectives and some fixed-form camera formations. These factors resulted in poor adaptability to dynamic scenes saturated with uncertainties. Recently, RL-based methods received more attention due to their potential for dynamic formation adjustments. These works focused on active 3D HPE in the Gazebo simulation (Tallamraju et al., 2020) or Panoptic dome (Joo et al., 2015; Pirinen et al., 2019; G\u00e4rtner et al., 2020) for active view selection. Among them, AirCapRL (Tallamraju et al., 2020) shares similarities with our work. However, it is restricted to coordinating between two cameras in clean landscapes without occlusion. We study the collaboration between more cameras and resolve the credit assignment issue with novel CTCR incentives. Meanwhile, we consider a more challenging scenario with multiple distracting humans as dynamic occlusions, which requires dedicated algorithms to handle. Multi-Camera Collaboration Many works in computer vision have studied multi-camera collaboration and designed active camera systems accordingly. Earlier works (Collins et al., 2003; Matsuyama et al., 2012) focused on developing a distributed system with PTZ cameras whose positions are fixed but viewpoints are rotatable. Owing to recent advances in MARL algorithms (Lowe et al., 2017; Sunehag et al., 2017; Rashid et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021), many works have formulated multi-camera collaboration as a multi-agent learning problem and solved it using MARL algorithms accordingly (Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Wenhong et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2022). However, most works focus on the target tracking problem, whereas this work attempts to solve the task of 3D HPE. Compared with tracking, 3D HPE has more strict criteria for optimal view selections due to correlations across multiple views, which requires stronger collaboration between cameras. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to experiment with various camera agents (n \u2265 3) to learn multi-camera collaboration strategies for active 3D HPE. 3 PROACTIVE MULTI-CAMERA COLLABORATION: This section will explain the formulation of multi-camera collaboration in 3D HPE as a Dec-POMDP. Then we will describe our proposed solutions for modeling the virtual environment\u2019s complex dynamics and strengthening credit assignment in the multi-camera collaboration task. 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION: We formulate the multi-cameras 3D HPE problem as a Decentralized Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), where each camera is considered as an agent which is decentralized controlled and has partial observability over the environment. Formally, a Dec-POMDP is defined as \u27e8S,O,A, n, P, r, \u03b3\u27e9, where S denotes the global state space of the environment, including all human states and camera states in our problem. oi \u2208 O denotes the agent i\u2019s local observation, i.e., the RGB image observed by camera i. An represents the joint action space of all n agents. P : S \u00d7An \u2192 S is the transition probability function P (st+1|st,at), in which at \u2208 An is a joint action by all n agents. At each timestep t, every agent obtains a local observation oti from the environment s t, performs action ati and receives its reward r(s t,at). \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1] is the discount factor used to calculate the cumulative discounted reward G(t) = \u2211 t\u2032\u2265t \u03b3 t\u2032\u2212t r(t\u2032). In a cooperative team, the objective is to learn a group of decentralized policies {\u03c0i(ati|oti)} n i=1 that maximizes E(s,a)\u223c\u03c0[G(t)]. For convenience, we let i means the agent index, JnK = {1, . . . , n} is the set for all agents, and \u2212i = JnK \\ {i} are all agents except agent i. Observation Camera agents have partial observability over the environment. The observation oi = (pi, \u03bei, \u03be\u2212i) of the camera agent i consists of: (1) pi, a set of states of visible humans to agent i, containing information including the detected human bounding box in the 2D local view, the 3D positions and orientations of all visible humans measured in both local coordinate frame of camera i and world coordinates; (2) own camera pose \u03bei showing the camera\u2019s position and orientation in world coordinates; (3) peer cameras poses \u03be\u2212i showing their positions and orientations in world coordinates and are obtained via multi-agent communication. Action Space The action space of each camera agent consists of the velocity of 3D egocentric translation (x, y, z) and velocity of 2D pitch-yaw rotation (\u03b8, \u03c8). To reduce the exploration space for state-action mapping, the agent\u2019s action space is discretized into three levels across all five dimensions. At each timestep, the camera agent can move its position by [+\u03b4, 0,\u2212\u03b4] in (x, y, z) directions and rotate about pitch-yaw axes by [+\u03b7, 0,\u2212\u03b7] degrees. 3.2 FRAMEWORK: This section will describe the technical framework that constitutes our camera agents, which contains a Perception Module and a Controller Module. The Perception Module maps the original RGB images taken by the camera to numerical observations. The Controller Module takes the numerical observations and correspondingly outputs the controls. Fig. 2 illustrates this framework. Perception Module The perception module executes a procedure consisting of four sequential stages: (1) 2D HPE. The agent performs 2D human detection and pose estimation on the observed RGB image with the YOLOv3 (Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) detector and the HRNet-w32 (Sun et al., 2019) pose estimator, respectively. Both models are pre-trained on the COCO dataset, (Lin et al., 2014) and their parameters are kept frozen during policy learning of camera agents to ensure crossscene generalization. (2) Person ReID. A ReID model (Zhong et al., 2018) is used to distinguish people in a scene. For simplicity, an appearance dictionary of all to-be-appeared people is built in advance following (G\u00e4rtner et al., 2020). At test time, the ReID network computes features for all detected people and identifies different people by comparing features to the pre-built appearance dictionary. (3) Multi-agent Communication. Detected 2D human pose, IDs, and own camera pose are broadcasted to other agents. (4) 3D human pose reconstruction. 3D human pose is finally reconstructed via local triangulation after receiving other agents\u2019 communications. Human position and orientation that are parts of pti can then be calculated from the reconstructed human pose. The whole process is illustrated in Appendix Fig. 10. Controller Module The controller module consists of a state encoder E and an actor network A. The state encoder E takes observation oti as input, encoding the temporal dynamics of the environment via LSTM. The future states of the target, pedestrians, and cameras are modeled using Mixture Density Network (MDN) (Bishop, 1994) to account for uncertainty. During model inference, it computes target position prediction, and then the (\u03d5, \u00b5, \u03c3) parameters of target prediction MDN are used as a part of the inputs to the actor network to enhance feature encoding. Please refer to Section 3.4 for more details regarding training the MDN. Feature Embedding zti = MLP(o t i), (1) Temporal Modeling hti = LSTM(z t i , h t\u22121 i ), (2) Human Trajectory Prediction p\u0302t+1tgt/pd = MDN(z t i , h t i, p t tgt/pd), (3) Final Embedding eti = E(o t i, h t\u22121 i ) = Concat(z t i , h t i, p\u0302 t+1 tgt ), (4) where ptgt and ppd refer to the state of the target and the pedestrian respectively. The actor network A consists of 2 fully-connected layers. It maps the encoded features to the final control actions, ati = A(E(o t i, h t\u22121 i )). 3.3 REWARD STRUCTURE: To alleviate the credit assignment issue that arises in multi-camera collaboration, we propose the Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR). We start by defining a base reward that reflects the reconstruction accuracy of the triangulated pose generated by the camera team. Then we explain how our CTCR is computed based on this base team reward. Reconstruction Accuracy as A Team Reward To directly reflect the reconstruction accuracy, the reward function negatively correlates with the pose estimation error (Mean Per Joint Position Error, MPJPE) of the multi-camera triangulation. Formally, r(X) = { 0, |X| \u2264 1, 1\u2212Gemen (MPJPE(X)), |X| \u2265 2. (5) Where X denotes a set of cameras that participate in the triangulation. Gemen(\u00b7) = 2(\u00b7/c) 2 (\u00b7/c)2+4 , is the Geman-McClure smoothing (Barron, 2019) function used to stabilize policy updates. Empirically we set c = 50mm in our experiments. In the context of our MAPPO baseline, X represents the entire camera team, and each camera receives a shared team reward r(X), from which the credit assignment issue arises. Intuitively, when one camera is occluded, all cameras receive the same reduced reward. It is hard to tell who the culprit is. To deal with this issue, we introduce CTCR. Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR) CTCR computes each agent\u2019s individual reward based on its marginal contribution to the collaborative multi-view triangulation. Please see Fig. 3 for a rundown of computing CTCR for a 3-cameras team. The contribution of agent i can be measured by: CTCR(i) = n \u00b7 \u03c6r(i), \u03c6r(i) = \u2211 S\u2286JnK\\{i} |S|!(n\u2212 |S| \u2212 1)! n! [r(S \u222a {i})\u2212 r(S)], (6) Where n denotes the total number of agents. S denotes all the subsets of JnK not containing agent i. |S|!(n\u2212|S|\u22121)!n! is the normalization term. [r(S \u222a {i}) \u2212 r(S)] means the marginal contribution of agent i. Note that \u2211 i\u2208JnK \u03c6r(i) = r(JnK). We additionally multiply a constant n to rescale the CTCR to have the same scale as the team reward. Specially, in the 2-cameras case, the individual CTCR should be equivalent to the team reward, i.e., CTCR(i = 1) = CTCR(i = 2) = r({1, 2}). 3.4 LEARNING MULTI-CAMERA COLLABORATION VIA MARL: We employ the multi-agent learning variant of PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) called Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) (Yu et al., 2021) to learn the collaboration strategy. Alongside the RL loss, we jointly train the model with five auxiliary tasks that encourage comprehension of the world dynamics and the stochasticity in human behaviors. The pseudocode of the learning algorithm can be found in Appendix B. World Dynamics Learning (WDL) We use the encoder\u2019s hidden states (zti , hti) as the basis to model the world. Three WDL objectives correspond to modeling agent dynamics : (1) learning the forward dynamics of the camera P1(\u03bet+1i |zti , hti, ati), (2) prediction of team reward P2(rt|zti , hti, ati), (3) prediction of future position of peer agents P3(\u03bet+1\u2212i |zti , hti, ati). Two WDL objectives correspond to modeling human dynamics: (4) prediction of future position of target person P4(pt+1tgt |zti , hti, pttgt), (5) prediction of future position of pedestrians, P5(pt+1pd |zti , hti, ptpd). All the probability functions above are approximated using Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Bishop, 1994). Total Training Objectives LTrain = LRL + \u03bbWDL LWDL. The LRL is the reinforcement learning loss consisting of PPO-Clipped loss and centralized-critic network loss similar to MAPPO (Yu et al., 2021). LWDL = \u2212 1n \u2211 l \u03bbl \u2211 i E[logPl(\u00b7|oti, hti, ati)] is the world dynamics learning loss that consists of MDN supervised losses on the five prediction tasks mentioned above. 4 EXPERIMENT: In this section, we first introduce our novel environment, UNREALPOSE, used for training and testing the learned policies. Then we compare our method with various passive multi-camera baselines and perform an ablation study on the effectiveness of the proposed CTCR and WDL objectives. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the learned policies by comparing them against other active multi-camera methods. Lastly, we test our method in four different scenarios to showcase its robustness. 4.1 UNREALPOSE: A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PROACTIVE HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION: We built a virtual environment for active HPE based on Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), a powerful 3D game engine that can provide real-time and photo-realistic renderings provided for making visuallystunning video games. The environment handles the interactions between realistic-behaving human crowds and camera agents. Here is a list of characteristics of UnrealPose that we would like to highlight: Realistic: Diverse generations of human trajectories, built-in collision avoidance, and several scenarios with different human appearance, terrain, and level of illumination. Flexibility: extensive configuration in numbers of humans, cameras, or their physical properties, more than 100 MoCap action sequences incorporated. RL-Ready: integrated with OpenAI Gym API, overhaul the communication module in the UnrealCV (Qiu et al., 2017) plugin with inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. For more detailed descriptions, please refer to Appendix Section C. 4.2 EVALUATION METRICS: We adopt Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) between the ground truth and the reconstructed 3D pose as our primary evaluation metric. While cameras making adjustments toward higher-quality perceptions could take several frames to complete or have high peaks in MPJPE that were overlooked by the mean aggregation. Hence we additionally use the \u201csuccess rate\u201d metric to evaluate the robustness and smooth execution of the learned policies. The success rate is the ratio of frames in an episode with MPJPE lower than \u03c4 . Formally, SuccessRate(\u03c4) = P (MPJPE \u2264 \u03c4). This metric is a proxy measure for the integrity of multi-view coordination. One instance of bad coordination may cause partial occlusions or have too many overlapping perceptions due to a bad formation. Both will result in a dramatic increase in MPJPE and consequently cause a drop in the success rate. 4.3 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: We trained all the learning-based control policies in a mix of 60 instances of the Blank Environment containing 1 to 6 humans (uniformly sampled). Each training run has 500,000 steps of environment interactions. For fair evaluation, we report all of the mean metrics based on the data of a hundred 500-step episodes. In all experiments, the cameras and humans interact in a 10m\u00d7 10m area. Active vs. Passive To show the necessity of proactive camera control, we compare the active camera control methods with three passive methods, i.e., Fixed Camera, Fixed Camera (RANSAC), and Fixed Camera (PlaneSweepPose). \u201cFixed Cameras\u201d denotes that the poses of the cameras are fixed, hanging 3 meters above ground with \u221235\u25e6 pitch angles (i.e. overseeing the entire area). The placements of these fixed cameras are carefully determined with strong priors, for example, right-angle, triangle, square, and pentagon formations for 2, 3, 4, and 5 cameras, respectively. \u201cRANSAC\u201d denotes the method that uses RANSAC (Fischler & Bolles, 1981) for enhanced triangulation. \u201cPlaneSweepPose\u201d represents the off-the-shelf learning-based method (Lin & Lee, 2021b) for multi-view 3D HPE. Please refer to the Appendix F.1 for more implementation details. We show the MPJPE(mm) and Success Rate versus a different number of cameras in Fig. 5. We observe that all passive baselines are being outperformed by the active approaches due to their inability to adjust camera views against dynamic occlusions. The improvement of active approaches is especially significant when the number of cameras is less, i.e. when the camera system has little or no redundancy against occlusions. Notably, the MPJPE achieved by our 3-camera control strategy is even lower than the MPJPE from 5 Fixed cameras. This suggests that proactive strategies can help reduce the number of cameras necessary for deployment. The Effectiveness of CTCR and WDL We also perform ablation studies on the two proposed modules (CTCR and WDL) to analyze their benefits to performance. We take \u201cMAPPO\u201d as the baseline for comparison, which is our method but trained instead by a shared global reconstruction reward and the absence of any world dynamics modeling. Fig. 5 shows the consistent performance gap between the \u201cMAPPO\u201d baseline and our methods (MAPPO + CTCR). This explains the increasing difficulty in credit assignments with more cameras. The proposed CTCR mitigates such an issue by computing the weighted marginal contribution of each camera. Also, CTCR promotes faster convergence. Training curves are shown in Appendix Fig. 11. Training with WDL objectives further improves the MPJPE metric for our 2-Camera model by approx. 60%. However, its supporting effect gradually weakens with the increasing number of cameras. We argue that is caused by the more complex dynamics involved with more cameras simultaneously interacting in the same environment. Notably, we observe that the agents trained with WDL are of better generalization in unseen scenes, as shown in Fig. 7. Ablation Study within the WDL Objectives We perform a detailed ablation study regarding the effect of each WDL sub-task on the model performance. As shown in Fig. 6, we can observe that the MPJPE metric gradually decreases as we incorporate more WDL losses. This aligns with our assumptions that training the model with world dynamics learning objectives will promote the model\u2019s ability to capture a better representation of future states, which in turn increases performance. Our method (full, + RLPred + TgtPred + PdPred + Merge) additionally demonstrates the importance of incorporating information regarding the target\u2019s future state into the encoder\u2019s output features. Predicting the target\u2019s future states should not only be used as an auxiliary task but should also directly influence the inference process of the actor model. Moreover, \u201cOurs\u201d method suffers less performance drop from increasing the number of pedestrians. In contrast, the accuracy of the baselines drops dramatically as the number of pedestrians increases. We argue that the proposed WDL objectives can improve the model\u2019s generalizability. Versus Other Active Methods To show the effectiveness of the learned policies, we further compare our method with other active multi-camera formation control methods in 3-cameras BlankEnv. (1) \u201cMAPPO\u201d (Yu et al., 2021) and (2) AirCapRL (Tallamraju et al., 2020) are two learningbased methods, built on PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). The main difference between these two methods is the reward shaping technique, i.e., AirCapRL additionally employs multiple carefullydesigned rewards (Tallamraju et al., 2020) for learning. We also program a (3) rule-based fixed formation control method (keeping an equilateral triangle, spread by 120\u25e6) to track and surround the target person. Results are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, these three baselines achieve similar reconstruction performance. Our method notably outperforms them, indicating a more effective multi- camera collaboration strategy for 3D HPE. For example, our method learns a spatially spread-out formation while automatically adjusting to avoid impending occlusion. Generalize to Various Scenarios We train the control policies in BlankEnv while testing them in three other realistic environments (SchoolGym, UrbanStreet, and Wilderness) to evaluate their generalization capability in unseen scenarios. Fig. 7 shows that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods with lower variance in MPJPE during the evaluations in three test environments. Note that we report the results in the BlankEnv as a reference. Qualitative Analysis In Figure 8, we show six examples of the emergent camera formations under our trained policies using the proposed method (CTCR + WDL). The camera agents learn to spread out and ascent above humans to avoid occlusions and collision. Their placements in an emerge formation are not assigned by other entities, but rather determined by the decentralized control policies themselves based on observations. For more vivid examples of the emergent formations, please refer to the project website for the demo videos.2 5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first active multi-camera system targeting the 3D reconstruction in a dynamic crowd. It is also the first study regarding active 3D HPE that promptly experimented with multi-camera collaborations at different scales and scenarios. We propose CTCR to alleviate the multi-agent credit assignment issue when the camera team scales and identifies multiple auxiliary tasks that are helpful for representation learning of complex dynamics. As a final note, we have decided to open-source our UE4 virtual environment and the visualization software. Limitation Admittedly, a couple of aspects of this work have room for improvement. Firstly, the camera agents received the positions for their teammates via non-disrupting broadcast of information, which may be prone to packet losses during deployment. One idea is to incorporate a specialized protocol for multi-agent communication into our pipeline, such as TarMAC (Das et al., 2019), I2C (Ding et al., 2020), or ToM2C(Wang et al., 2022). Secondly, intended initially to reduce the communication bandwidth (for example, to eliminate the need for image transmission between cameras), the current pipeline comprises a Human Re-Identification module requiring a pre-scan memory on all to-be-appeared human subjects. For some out-of-distribution humans\u2019 appearances, the current ReID module may not be able to recognize. 2Project Website for demo videos: https://sites.google.com/view/active3dpose/home A ETHICAL DISCUSSION: There are many great benefits brought by the advances in active 3D HPE technologies, for example, biomechanical analysis in sports and automated video-assisted coach (AVAC). However, in reality, misusing these technologies by repressive surveillance may lead to privacy infringements. We condemn these malicious acts and advocate fair uses of our virtual environment UNREALPOSE and all other 3D HPE technologies. For maximum safety compliance, we have introduced safety-related features to ensure minimal collisions (Appendix Section G).

This environment also supports various settings ranging from single-target single-camera settings to multi-target multi-camera settings. Here we provide a more detailed description of the three key characteristics of UnrealPose: Realistic The built-in navigation system governs the collision avoidance movements of virtual humans against dynamic obstacles. In the meantime, it also ensures diverse generations of walking trajectories. These features enable the users to simulate a realistic-looking crowd exhibiting socially acceptable behaviors. We have also provided several pre-set scenes, e.g., school gym, wilderness, urban crossing, and etc. These scenes have notable differences in illuminations, terrains, and crowd appearances to reflect the dramatically different-looking scenarios in real-life. Extensive Configuration The environment can be configured with different numbers of humans and cameras and swapped across other scenarios with ease, which we demonstrated in Fig 4(a-d). Besides simulating walking human crowds, the environment incorporates over 100 Mocap action sequences with smooth animation interpolations to enrich the data variety for other MoCap tasks. RL-Ready We use the UnrealCV (Qiu et al., 2017) plugin as the medium to acquire images and annotations from the environment. The original UnrealCV plugin suffers from unstable data transfer and unexpected disconnections under high CPU workloads. To ensure fast and reliable data acquisition for large-scale MARL experiments, we overhauled the communication module in the UnrealCV plugin with inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, which eliminates the aforementioned instabilities. C.1 VISUALIZATION TOOL We provide a visualization tool to facilitate per-frame analysis of the learned policy and reconstruction results (shown in Fig. 9). The main interface consists of four parts: (1) Live 2D views from all cameras. (2) 3D spatial view of camera positions and reconstructions. (3) Plot of statistics. (4) Frame control bar. This visualization tool supports different numbers of humans and cameras. Meanwhile, it is written in Python to support easy customization. C.2 LICENSE: All assets used in the environment are commercially-available and obtained from the UE4 Marketplace. The environment and tools developed in this work are licensed under Apache License 2.0. D OBSERVATION PROCESSING: Fig.10 shows the pipeline of the observation processing. Each camera observes an RGB image and detects the 2D human poses and IDs via the Perception Module described in the main paper. The camera pose, 2D human poses and IDs are then broadcast to other cameras for multi-view 3D triangulation. The human position is calculated as the median of the reconstructed joints. Human orientation is calculated from the cross product of the reconstructed shoulder and spine. E IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS E.1 TRAINING DETAILS: All control policies are trained in the BlackEnv scene. At the testing stage, we apply zeroshot transfer for the learned policies to three realistic scenes: SchoolGym, UrbanStreet, and Wilderness. To simulate a dynamic human crowd that performs high random behaviors, we sample arbitrary goals for each human and employ the built-in navigation system to generate collision-free trajectories. Each human walks at a random speed. To ensure the generalization across a different number of humans, we train our RL policy with a mixture of environments of 1 to 6 humans. The learning rate is set to 5\u00d7 10\u22124 with scheduled decay during the training phase. The annealing schedule for the learning rate is detailed in Table. 2. The maximum episode length is 500 steps, discounted factor \u03b3 is 0.99 and the GAE horizon is 25 steps. Each sampling iteration produces a training batch with the size of 1, 500 steps, then we perform 16 iterations on every training batch with 4 SGD mini-batch updates for each iteration. Table. 2 shows the common training hyper-parameters shared between the baseline models (MAPPO) and all of our methods. Table. 3 shows the hyperparameters for the WDL module. E.2 COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES: We used 15 Ray workers for each experiment to ensure consistency in the training procedure. Each worker carries a Gym vectorized environment consisting of 4 actual environment instances. Each worker demands approximately 3.7GB of VRAM. We run each experiment with 8 NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. Depending on the number of camera agents, the total training hours required for an experiment to run 500k steps will vary between 4 to 12 hours. E.3 TRAINING CURVE: Fig. 11 shows the training curves of our method and the baseline method. We can find that our methods converge faster and improve reconstruction accuracy than the baseline method. F ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS:  F.1 BASELINE \u2014 FIXED-CAMERAS: In addition to the triangulation and RANSAC baselines introduced in the main text, we compare and elaborate on two more baselines that use fixed cameras: (1) fixed cameras with RANSAC-based triangulation and temporal smoothing (TS) (2) an off-shelf 3D pose estimator PlaneSweepPose (Lin & Lee, 2021a). In the temporal smoothing baseline, we applied a low-pass filter (Casiez et al., 2012) and temporal fusion where the algorithm will fill in any missing keypoints in the current frame with the detected keypoints from the last frame. In the PlaneSweep baseline, as per the official instructions, we train three separate models (3 cams to 5 cams) with the same camera setup as in our testing scenarios. We have tested the trained models in different scenarios and reported the MPJPE results in Table 4, 5, 6 and 7. Note that, this off-shelf pose estimator performs better than the Fixed-Camera Baseline (Triangulation) but still underperforms compared to our active method. Fig. 12 illustrates the formations of the fixed camera baselines. Camera placements for all fixed-camera baselines are shown in Fig. 12. These formations are carefully designed not to disadvantage the fixed-camera baselines on-purpose. Especially for the 5-cameras pentagon formation, which helps the fixed-camera baseline to obtain satisfactory performance on the 5-camera setting as shown in Tables 4,5,6 and 7. F.2 OUR METHOD ENHANCED WITH RANSAC-BASED TRIANGULATION: RANSAC is a generic technique that can be used to improve triangulation performance. In this experiment, we also train and test our model with RANSAC. The final result (Table 8) shows a further improvement on our original triangulation version. G GENERATING SAFE AND SMOOTH TRAJECTORIES:  G.1 COLLISION AVOIDANCE: In order to generate safe trajectories, in this section, we introduce and evaluate two different ways to enforce collision avoidance between cameras and humans. Obstacle Collision Avoidance (OCA) OCA resembles a feed-forward PID controller on the final control outputs before execution. Concretely, OCA adds a constant reverse quantity to the control output if it detects any surrounding objects within its safety range. This \u201cdetouring\u201d mechanism safeguards the cameras from possible collisions and prevents them from making dangerous maneuvers. Action-Masking (AM) AM also resembles a feed-forward controller but is instead embedded into the forward step of the deep-learning model. At each step, AM module first identifies the dangerous actions among all possible actions, then modifies the probabilities (output by the policy model) of choosing the hazardous actions to be zero so that the learning-based control policy will never pick them. Note that AM must be trained with the MARL policy model. We proposed the minimum Camera-Human distance (in which the scope includes the target and the pedestrians) as the safety metric. It measures the distance between the closest human and the camera at a timestep. Fig. 13 shows the histograms of Min Camera-Human distance sampled over five episodes of 500 steps. G.2 TRAJECTORY SMOOTHING: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) To generate smooth trajectories, we introduce EMA to smooth the outputs of our learned policy model. EMA is a common technique used in smoothing time-series data. In our case, the smoothing operator is defined as : a\u0302t = a\u0302t\u22121 + \u03b7 \u00b7 (at \u2212 a\u0302t\u22121) Where at is the action (or control signal) output by the model at the current step, a\u0302t\u22121 is the smoothed action from the last step and \u03b7 is the smoothing factor. A smaller \u03b7 results in greater smoothness. a\u0302t is the smoothed action that the camera will execute. G.3 ROBUSTNESS OF THE LEARNED POLICY: In this section, we evaluate the robustness of our model on different external perturbations to the control signal. In conclusion, our model shows resilience against the delay effect and random noise. Delay EMA also brings a delay effect while smoothing the generated trajectory. The level of smoothing positively correlates with a larger delay factor. Here, we evaluate our model\u2019s robustness to the EMA simulated delay. Random Action Noise Control devices in real-life are inevitably affected by errors. For example, the control signal of a controller may be over-damped or may overshoot. We simulated this type of random error by multiplying the output action by a uniformly-sampled noise. In Table 9, we intend to observe the effects of EMA delay and random action noise on the reconstruction accuracy of our model, marked as \u201cVanilla\u201d.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023. Remember you need to make 3 reviewer agents for each paper. GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Proactive Multi-Camera Collaboration for 3D Human Pose Estimation\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Marker-less motion capture (MoCap) has broad commercial applications in many areas such as cinematography, medical research, virtual reality (VR), sports, and etc. Their successes can be partly attributed to recent developments in 3D Human pose estimation (HPE) techniques (Tu et al., 2020; Iskakov et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Jafarian et al., 2019; Pavlakos et al., 2017b; Dong et al., 2019; Lin & Lee, 2021b). A straightforward implementation to solve multi-views 3D HPE is to use fixed cameras. Although being a convenient solution, it is less effective against dynamic occlusions. Moreover, fixed camera solutions confine tracking targets within a constrained space, therefore less applicable to outdoor MoCap. On the contrary, active cameras such as ones mounted on drones can maneuver proactively against incoming occlusions. Owing to its remarkable flexibility, the active approach has thus attracted overwhelming interest (Tallamraju et al., 2020; Ho et al., 2021; N\u00e4geli et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2017; Kiciroglu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018; Saini et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). Previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of using active cameras for 3D HPE on a single target in indoor (Kiciroglu et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2018), clean landscapes (Tallamraju et al., 2020; N\u00e4geli et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Saini et al., 2022) or landscapes with scattered static obstacles (Ho et al., 2021). However, to our best knowledge, we have not seen any existing work that experimented with multiple (n > 3) active cameras to conduct 3D HPE in human crowd. There are two key challenges : First, frequent human-to-human interactions lead to random dynamic occlusions. Different from previous works that only consider clean landscapes or static obstacles, dynamic scenes require frequent adjustments of cameras\u2019 viewpoints for occlusion avoidance while keeping an overall good team formation for multi-view reconstruction. Therefore, it is challenging to achieve optimality with a fixed camera formation or a hand-crafted control policy. In addition, the complex behavioral pattern of a human crowd makes the occlusion patterns less comprehensible and predictable, further increasing the difficulty in control. Second, as the size of a camera team grows, the multi-agent credit assignment issue becomes prominent which hinders policy learning of the camera agents. Concretely, as a team effort, multi-view 3D HPE requires inputs from multiple cameras to generate an accurate reconstruction. Having more camera agents participate in a reconstruction introduces more redundancy. Though it reduces the susceptibility to reconstruction failure caused by dynamic occlusions, it consequently weakens the association between the individual performance and the reconstruction accuracy of the team, which likely leads to the \u201clazy agent\u201d problem (Sunehag et al., 2017). A shared reward risks disincentivizing some individual cameras on exploring better viewpoints due to an adequate accuracy already being attained by their teammates alone. We introduce a proactive multi-camera collaboration framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for real-time distributive adjustments of multi-camera formation for 3D HPE in a human crowd. In our approach, multiple camera agents perform seamless collaboration for successful reconstructions of 3D human poses. Additionally, it is a decentralized framework which offers flexibility over the size of formation and eliminates dependency to a control hierarchy or a centralized entity. In regards of the first challenge, we argue the utmost importance of the model\u2019s capability to anticipate human motions and future states of the environment. To model these properties into the state representations, we incorporate World Dynamics Learning into the training of our model, i.e., learning with five auxiliary tasks to predict target\u2019s position, pedestrians\u2019 positions, self state, teammates\u2019 states and team reward. To tackle the second challenge, we further introduce the Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR), which incentivizes each agent according to its characteristic contribution to a 3D reconstruction. Inspired by the Shapley Value (Rapoport, 1970), CTCR computes the average weighted marginal contribution to the 3D reconstruction for any given agent over all possible coalitions that contain it. This reward aims to directly associate agents\u2019 levels of participation with their return and guides their policy learning when the team reward alone is insufficient to produce such direct association. Moreover, CTCR penalizes occluded camera agents more efficiently than the shared reward, encouraging emergent occlusion avoidance behaviors. Empirical results show that CTCR can accelerate convergence and increase reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, CTCR is a general approach that can benefit policy learning in active 3D HPE and serve as a new assessment metric for view selection in other multi-view reconstruction tasks. In experiments, we build photo-realistic environments based on Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and UnrealCV (Qiu et al., 2017) for training and testing. Our environments can simulate realistic-behaving crowds with assurances of high fidelity and customizability. We train the agents on a Blank environment and validate the generalizability on three unseen scenarios with different landscapes, levels of illumination, human appearances, and various quantities of cameras and humans. The empirical results show that our method can achieve more accurate and stable 3D pose estimates than off-the-shelf passive- and active-camera baselines. To help facilitate more fruitful research on this topic, we will open-source our environments that are integrated with OpenAI Gym-API (Brockman et al., 2016) and together with a dedicated visualization tool. Here we summarize the key contributions of our work:1 \u2022 We formulate active 3D human pose estimation in a human crowd problem as a Dec-POMDP, and proposed a novel multi-camera (n \u2265 3) collaboration framework. \u2022 We propose CTCR to improve credit assignment in multi-camera collaboration and demonstrate notable improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to both passive and active baselines. \u2022 We introduce five auxiliary tasks called to help the model learn environment dynamics, further enhancing the model\u2019s ability to handle highly dynamic scenes. \u2022 We contribute high-fidelity environments built for simulating realistic-looking human crowds with authentic behaviors, along with visualization software for frame-by-frame video analysis. 1Project Website for demo videos: https://sites.google.com/view/active3dpose/home 2 RELATED WORK: 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) Recent works demonstrated recovering 3D human pose from a single monocular image (Ma et al., 2021; Pavlakos et al., 2017a; Martinez et al., 2017; Kanazawa et al., 2018; Pavlakos et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018; Ci et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2020; Ci et al., 2020) or monocular video (Mehta et al., 2017; Hossain & Little, 2018; Pavllo et al., 2019; Kocabas et al., 2020). Another line of work utilized multi-camera systems (i.e. triangulation) to eliminate ambiguity and provide redundancy to visibility (Qiu et al., 2019; Jafarian et al., 2019; Pavlakos et al., 2017b; Dong et al., 2019; Lin & Lee, 2021b; Tu et al., 2020; Iskakov et al., 2019). However, these multi-view methods are limited to the indoor laboratory environment with fixed cameras. This work presents an active camera system with multiple mobile cameras for mocap in outdoor scenes. Proactive Motion Capture Few previous works studied proactive motion capture with a single mobile camera (Zhou et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2018; Kiciroglu et al., 2019). In comparison, more works studied the control of a multi-camera team. Among them, many are based on optimization with various system designs, including marker-based (N\u00e4geli et al., 2018), RGBD-based (Xu et al., 2017), two-stage system (Saini et al., 2019; Tallamraju et al., 2019), hierarchical system (Ho et al., 2021), etc. It is important to note that all the above methods deal with static occlusion sources or clean landscapes. Also, the common similarity shared by these works is the use of hand-crafted optimization objectives and some fixed-form camera formations. These factors resulted in poor adaptability to dynamic scenes saturated with uncertainties. Recently, RL-based methods received more attention due to their potential for dynamic formation adjustments. These works focused on active 3D HPE in the Gazebo simulation (Tallamraju et al., 2020) or Panoptic dome (Joo et al., 2015; Pirinen et al., 2019; G\u00e4rtner et al., 2020) for active view selection. Among them, AirCapRL (Tallamraju et al., 2020) shares similarities with our work. However, it is restricted to coordinating between two cameras in clean landscapes without occlusion. We study the collaboration between more cameras and resolve the credit assignment issue with novel CTCR incentives. Meanwhile, we consider a more challenging scenario with multiple distracting humans as dynamic occlusions, which requires dedicated algorithms to handle. Multi-Camera Collaboration Many works in computer vision have studied multi-camera collaboration and designed active camera systems accordingly. Earlier works (Collins et al., 2003; Matsuyama et al., 2012) focused on developing a distributed system with PTZ cameras whose positions are fixed but viewpoints are rotatable. Owing to recent advances in MARL algorithms (Lowe et al., 2017; Sunehag et al., 2017; Rashid et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021), many works have formulated multi-camera collaboration as a multi-agent learning problem and solved it using MARL algorithms accordingly (Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Wenhong et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2022). However, most works focus on the target tracking problem, whereas this work attempts to solve the task of 3D HPE. Compared with tracking, 3D HPE has more strict criteria for optimal view selections due to correlations across multiple views, which requires stronger collaboration between cameras. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to experiment with various camera agents (n \u2265 3) to learn multi-camera collaboration strategies for active 3D HPE. 3 PROACTIVE MULTI-CAMERA COLLABORATION: This section will explain the formulation of multi-camera collaboration in 3D HPE as a Dec-POMDP. Then we will describe our proposed solutions for modeling the virtual environment\u2019s complex dynamics and strengthening credit assignment in the multi-camera collaboration task. 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION: We formulate the multi-cameras 3D HPE problem as a Decentralized Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), where each camera is considered as an agent which is decentralized controlled and has partial observability over the environment. Formally, a Dec-POMDP is defined as \u27e8S,O,A, n, P, r, \u03b3\u27e9, where S denotes the global state space of the environment, including all human states and camera states in our problem. oi \u2208 O denotes the agent i\u2019s local observation, i.e., the RGB image observed by camera i. An represents the joint action space of all n agents. P : S \u00d7An \u2192 S is the transition probability function P (st+1|st,at), in which at \u2208 An is a joint action by all n agents. At each timestep t, every agent obtains a local observation oti from the environment s t, performs action ati and receives its reward r(s t,at). \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1] is the discount factor used to calculate the cumulative discounted reward G(t) = \u2211 t\u2032\u2265t \u03b3 t\u2032\u2212t r(t\u2032). In a cooperative team, the objective is to learn a group of decentralized policies {\u03c0i(ati|oti)} n i=1 that maximizes E(s,a)\u223c\u03c0[G(t)]. For convenience, we let i means the agent index, JnK = {1, . . . , n} is the set for all agents, and \u2212i = JnK \\ {i} are all agents except agent i. Observation Camera agents have partial observability over the environment. The observation oi = (pi, \u03bei, \u03be\u2212i) of the camera agent i consists of: (1) pi, a set of states of visible humans to agent i, containing information including the detected human bounding box in the 2D local view, the 3D positions and orientations of all visible humans measured in both local coordinate frame of camera i and world coordinates; (2) own camera pose \u03bei showing the camera\u2019s position and orientation in world coordinates; (3) peer cameras poses \u03be\u2212i showing their positions and orientations in world coordinates and are obtained via multi-agent communication. Action Space The action space of each camera agent consists of the velocity of 3D egocentric translation (x, y, z) and velocity of 2D pitch-yaw rotation (\u03b8, \u03c8). To reduce the exploration space for state-action mapping, the agent\u2019s action space is discretized into three levels across all five dimensions. At each timestep, the camera agent can move its position by [+\u03b4, 0,\u2212\u03b4] in (x, y, z) directions and rotate about pitch-yaw axes by [+\u03b7, 0,\u2212\u03b7] degrees. 3.2 FRAMEWORK: This section will describe the technical framework that constitutes our camera agents, which contains a Perception Module and a Controller Module. The Perception Module maps the original RGB images taken by the camera to numerical observations. The Controller Module takes the numerical observations and correspondingly outputs the controls. Fig. 2 illustrates this framework. Perception Module The perception module executes a procedure consisting of four sequential stages: (1) 2D HPE. The agent performs 2D human detection and pose estimation on the observed RGB image with the YOLOv3 (Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) detector and the HRNet-w32 (Sun et al., 2019) pose estimator, respectively. Both models are pre-trained on the COCO dataset, (Lin et al., 2014) and their parameters are kept frozen during policy learning of camera agents to ensure crossscene generalization. (2) Person ReID. A ReID model (Zhong et al., 2018) is used to distinguish people in a scene. For simplicity, an appearance dictionary of all to-be-appeared people is built in advance following (G\u00e4rtner et al., 2020). At test time, the ReID network computes features for all detected people and identifies different people by comparing features to the pre-built appearance dictionary. (3) Multi-agent Communication. Detected 2D human pose, IDs, and own camera pose are broadcasted to other agents. (4) 3D human pose reconstruction. 3D human pose is finally reconstructed via local triangulation after receiving other agents\u2019 communications. Human position and orientation that are parts of pti can then be calculated from the reconstructed human pose. The whole process is illustrated in Appendix Fig. 10. Controller Module The controller module consists of a state encoder E and an actor network A. The state encoder E takes observation oti as input, encoding the temporal dynamics of the environment via LSTM. The future states of the target, pedestrians, and cameras are modeled using Mixture Density Network (MDN) (Bishop, 1994) to account for uncertainty. During model inference, it computes target position prediction, and then the (\u03d5, \u00b5, \u03c3) parameters of target prediction MDN are used as a part of the inputs to the actor network to enhance feature encoding. Please refer to Section 3.4 for more details regarding training the MDN. Feature Embedding zti = MLP(o t i), (1) Temporal Modeling hti = LSTM(z t i , h t\u22121 i ), (2) Human Trajectory Prediction p\u0302t+1tgt/pd = MDN(z t i , h t i, p t tgt/pd), (3) Final Embedding eti = E(o t i, h t\u22121 i ) = Concat(z t i , h t i, p\u0302 t+1 tgt ), (4) where ptgt and ppd refer to the state of the target and the pedestrian respectively. The actor network A consists of 2 fully-connected layers. It maps the encoded features to the final control actions, ati = A(E(o t i, h t\u22121 i )). 3.3 REWARD STRUCTURE: To alleviate the credit assignment issue that arises in multi-camera collaboration, we propose the Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR). We start by defining a base reward that reflects the reconstruction accuracy of the triangulated pose generated by the camera team. Then we explain how our CTCR is computed based on this base team reward. Reconstruction Accuracy as A Team Reward To directly reflect the reconstruction accuracy, the reward function negatively correlates with the pose estimation error (Mean Per Joint Position Error, MPJPE) of the multi-camera triangulation. Formally, r(X) = { 0, |X| \u2264 1, 1\u2212Gemen (MPJPE(X)), |X| \u2265 2. (5) Where X denotes a set of cameras that participate in the triangulation. Gemen(\u00b7) = 2(\u00b7/c) 2 (\u00b7/c)2+4 , is the Geman-McClure smoothing (Barron, 2019) function used to stabilize policy updates. Empirically we set c = 50mm in our experiments. In the context of our MAPPO baseline, X represents the entire camera team, and each camera receives a shared team reward r(X), from which the credit assignment issue arises. Intuitively, when one camera is occluded, all cameras receive the same reduced reward. It is hard to tell who the culprit is. To deal with this issue, we introduce CTCR. Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR) CTCR computes each agent\u2019s individual reward based on its marginal contribution to the collaborative multi-view triangulation. Please see Fig. 3 for a rundown of computing CTCR for a 3-cameras team. The contribution of agent i can be measured by: CTCR(i) = n \u00b7 \u03c6r(i), \u03c6r(i) = \u2211 S\u2286JnK\\{i} |S|!(n\u2212 |S| \u2212 1)! n! [r(S \u222a {i})\u2212 r(S)], (6) Where n denotes the total number of agents. S denotes all the subsets of JnK not containing agent i. |S|!(n\u2212|S|\u22121)!n! is the normalization term. [r(S \u222a {i}) \u2212 r(S)] means the marginal contribution of agent i. Note that \u2211 i\u2208JnK \u03c6r(i) = r(JnK). We additionally multiply a constant n to rescale the CTCR to have the same scale as the team reward. Specially, in the 2-cameras case, the individual CTCR should be equivalent to the team reward, i.e., CTCR(i = 1) = CTCR(i = 2) = r({1, 2}). 3.4 LEARNING MULTI-CAMERA COLLABORATION VIA MARL: We employ the multi-agent learning variant of PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) called Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) (Yu et al., 2021) to learn the collaboration strategy. Alongside the RL loss, we jointly train the model with five auxiliary tasks that encourage comprehension of the world dynamics and the stochasticity in human behaviors. The pseudocode of the learning algorithm can be found in Appendix B. World Dynamics Learning (WDL) We use the encoder\u2019s hidden states (zti , hti) as the basis to model the world. Three WDL objectives correspond to modeling agent dynamics : (1) learning the forward dynamics of the camera P1(\u03bet+1i |zti , hti, ati), (2) prediction of team reward P2(rt|zti , hti, ati), (3) prediction of future position of peer agents P3(\u03bet+1\u2212i |zti , hti, ati). Two WDL objectives correspond to modeling human dynamics: (4) prediction of future position of target person P4(pt+1tgt |zti , hti, pttgt), (5) prediction of future position of pedestrians, P5(pt+1pd |zti , hti, ptpd). All the probability functions above are approximated using Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Bishop, 1994). Total Training Objectives LTrain = LRL + \u03bbWDL LWDL. The LRL is the reinforcement learning loss consisting of PPO-Clipped loss and centralized-critic network loss similar to MAPPO (Yu et al., 2021). LWDL = \u2212 1n \u2211 l \u03bbl \u2211 i E[logPl(\u00b7|oti, hti, ati)] is the world dynamics learning loss that consists of MDN supervised losses on the five prediction tasks mentioned above. 4 EXPERIMENT: In this section, we first introduce our novel environment, UNREALPOSE, used for training and testing the learned policies. Then we compare our method with various passive multi-camera baselines and perform an ablation study on the effectiveness of the proposed CTCR and WDL objectives. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the learned policies by comparing them against other active multi-camera methods. Lastly, we test our method in four different scenarios to showcase its robustness. 4.1 UNREALPOSE: A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PROACTIVE HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION: We built a virtual environment for active HPE based on Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), a powerful 3D game engine that can provide real-time and photo-realistic renderings provided for making visuallystunning video games. The environment handles the interactions between realistic-behaving human crowds and camera agents. Here is a list of characteristics of UnrealPose that we would like to highlight: Realistic: Diverse generations of human trajectories, built-in collision avoidance, and several scenarios with different human appearance, terrain, and level of illumination. Flexibility: extensive configuration in numbers of humans, cameras, or their physical properties, more than 100 MoCap action sequences incorporated. RL-Ready: integrated with OpenAI Gym API, overhaul the communication module in the UnrealCV (Qiu et al., 2017) plugin with inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. For more detailed descriptions, please refer to Appendix Section C. 4.2 EVALUATION METRICS: We adopt Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) between the ground truth and the reconstructed 3D pose as our primary evaluation metric. While cameras making adjustments toward higher-quality perceptions could take several frames to complete or have high peaks in MPJPE that were overlooked by the mean aggregation. Hence we additionally use the \u201csuccess rate\u201d metric to evaluate the robustness and smooth execution of the learned policies. The success rate is the ratio of frames in an episode with MPJPE lower than \u03c4 . Formally, SuccessRate(\u03c4) = P (MPJPE \u2264 \u03c4). This metric is a proxy measure for the integrity of multi-view coordination. One instance of bad coordination may cause partial occlusions or have too many overlapping perceptions due to a bad formation. Both will result in a dramatic increase in MPJPE and consequently cause a drop in the success rate. 4.3 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: We trained all the learning-based control policies in a mix of 60 instances of the Blank Environment containing 1 to 6 humans (uniformly sampled). Each training run has 500,000 steps of environment interactions. For fair evaluation, we report all of the mean metrics based on the data of a hundred 500-step episodes. In all experiments, the cameras and humans interact in a 10m\u00d7 10m area. Active vs. Passive To show the necessity of proactive camera control, we compare the active camera control methods with three passive methods, i.e., Fixed Camera, Fixed Camera (RANSAC), and Fixed Camera (PlaneSweepPose). \u201cFixed Cameras\u201d denotes that the poses of the cameras are fixed, hanging 3 meters above ground with \u221235\u25e6 pitch angles (i.e. overseeing the entire area). The placements of these fixed cameras are carefully determined with strong priors, for example, right-angle, triangle, square, and pentagon formations for 2, 3, 4, and 5 cameras, respectively. \u201cRANSAC\u201d denotes the method that uses RANSAC (Fischler & Bolles, 1981) for enhanced triangulation. \u201cPlaneSweepPose\u201d represents the off-the-shelf learning-based method (Lin & Lee, 2021b) for multi-view 3D HPE. Please refer to the Appendix F.1 for more implementation details. We show the MPJPE(mm) and Success Rate versus a different number of cameras in Fig. 5. We observe that all passive baselines are being outperformed by the active approaches due to their inability to adjust camera views against dynamic occlusions. The improvement of active approaches is especially significant when the number of cameras is less, i.e. when the camera system has little or no redundancy against occlusions. Notably, the MPJPE achieved by our 3-camera control strategy is even lower than the MPJPE from 5 Fixed cameras. This suggests that proactive strategies can help reduce the number of cameras necessary for deployment. The Effectiveness of CTCR and WDL We also perform ablation studies on the two proposed modules (CTCR and WDL) to analyze their benefits to performance. We take \u201cMAPPO\u201d as the baseline for comparison, which is our method but trained instead by a shared global reconstruction reward and the absence of any world dynamics modeling. Fig. 5 shows the consistent performance gap between the \u201cMAPPO\u201d baseline and our methods (MAPPO + CTCR). This explains the increasing difficulty in credit assignments with more cameras. The proposed CTCR mitigates such an issue by computing the weighted marginal contribution of each camera. Also, CTCR promotes faster convergence. Training curves are shown in Appendix Fig. 11. Training with WDL objectives further improves the MPJPE metric for our 2-Camera model by approx. 60%. However, its supporting effect gradually weakens with the increasing number of cameras. We argue that is caused by the more complex dynamics involved with more cameras simultaneously interacting in the same environment. Notably, we observe that the agents trained with WDL are of better generalization in unseen scenes, as shown in Fig. 7. Ablation Study within the WDL Objectives We perform a detailed ablation study regarding the effect of each WDL sub-task on the model performance. As shown in Fig. 6, we can observe that the MPJPE metric gradually decreases as we incorporate more WDL losses. This aligns with our assumptions that training the model with world dynamics learning objectives will promote the model\u2019s ability to capture a better representation of future states, which in turn increases performance. Our method (full, + RLPred + TgtPred + PdPred + Merge) additionally demonstrates the importance of incorporating information regarding the target\u2019s future state into the encoder\u2019s output features. Predicting the target\u2019s future states should not only be used as an auxiliary task but should also directly influence the inference process of the actor model. Moreover, \u201cOurs\u201d method suffers less performance drop from increasing the number of pedestrians. In contrast, the accuracy of the baselines drops dramatically as the number of pedestrians increases. We argue that the proposed WDL objectives can improve the model\u2019s generalizability. Versus Other Active Methods To show the effectiveness of the learned policies, we further compare our method with other active multi-camera formation control methods in 3-cameras BlankEnv. (1) \u201cMAPPO\u201d (Yu et al., 2021) and (2) AirCapRL (Tallamraju et al., 2020) are two learningbased methods, built on PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). The main difference between these two methods is the reward shaping technique, i.e., AirCapRL additionally employs multiple carefullydesigned rewards (Tallamraju et al., 2020) for learning. We also program a (3) rule-based fixed formation control method (keeping an equilateral triangle, spread by 120\u25e6) to track and surround the target person. Results are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, these three baselines achieve similar reconstruction performance. Our method notably outperforms them, indicating a more effective multi- camera collaboration strategy for 3D HPE. For example, our method learns a spatially spread-out formation while automatically adjusting to avoid impending occlusion. Generalize to Various Scenarios We train the control policies in BlankEnv while testing them in three other realistic environments (SchoolGym, UrbanStreet, and Wilderness) to evaluate their generalization capability in unseen scenarios. Fig. 7 shows that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods with lower variance in MPJPE during the evaluations in three test environments. Note that we report the results in the BlankEnv as a reference. Qualitative Analysis In Figure 8, we show six examples of the emergent camera formations under our trained policies using the proposed method (CTCR + WDL). The camera agents learn to spread out and ascent above humans to avoid occlusions and collision. Their placements in an emerge formation are not assigned by other entities, but rather determined by the decentralized control policies themselves based on observations. For more vivid examples of the emergent formations, please refer to the project website for the demo videos.2 5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first active multi-camera system targeting the 3D reconstruction in a dynamic crowd. It is also the first study regarding active 3D HPE that promptly experimented with multi-camera collaborations at different scales and scenarios. We propose CTCR to alleviate the multi-agent credit assignment issue when the camera team scales and identifies multiple auxiliary tasks that are helpful for representation learning of complex dynamics. As a final note, we have decided to open-source our UE4 virtual environment and the visualization software. Limitation Admittedly, a couple of aspects of this work have room for improvement. Firstly, the camera agents received the positions for their teammates via non-disrupting broadcast of information, which may be prone to packet losses during deployment. One idea is to incorporate a specialized protocol for multi-agent communication into our pipeline, such as TarMAC (Das et al., 2019), I2C (Ding et al., 2020), or ToM2C(Wang et al., 2022). Secondly, intended initially to reduce the communication bandwidth (for example, to eliminate the need for image transmission between cameras), the current pipeline comprises a Human Re-Identification module requiring a pre-scan memory on all to-be-appeared human subjects. For some out-of-distribution humans\u2019 appearances, the current ReID module may not be able to recognize. 2Project Website for demo videos: https://sites.google.com/view/active3dpose/home A ETHICAL DISCUSSION: There are many great benefits brought by the advances in active 3D HPE technologies, for example, biomechanical analysis in sports and automated video-assisted coach (AVAC). However, in reality, misusing these technologies by repressive surveillance may lead to privacy infringements. We condemn these malicious acts and advocate fair uses of our virtual environment UNREALPOSE and all other 3D HPE technologies. For maximum safety compliance, we have introduced safety-related features to ensure minimal collisions (Appendix Section G).

This environment also supports various settings ranging from single-target single-camera settings to multi-target multi-camera settings. Here we provide a more detailed description of the three key characteristics of UnrealPose: Realistic The built-in navigation system governs the collision avoidance movements of virtual humans against dynamic obstacles. In the meantime, it also ensures diverse generations of walking trajectories. These features enable the users to simulate a realistic-looking crowd exhibiting socially acceptable behaviors. We have also provided several pre-set scenes, e.g., school gym, wilderness, urban crossing, and etc. These scenes have notable differences in illuminations, terrains, and crowd appearances to reflect the dramatically different-looking scenarios in real-life. Extensive Configuration The environment can be configured with different numbers of humans and cameras and swapped across other scenarios with ease, which we demonstrated in Fig 4(a-d). Besides simulating walking human crowds, the environment incorporates over 100 Mocap action sequences with smooth animation interpolations to enrich the data variety for other MoCap tasks. RL-Ready We use the UnrealCV (Qiu et al., 2017) plugin as the medium to acquire images and annotations from the environment. The original UnrealCV plugin suffers from unstable data transfer and unexpected disconnections under high CPU workloads. To ensure fast and reliable data acquisition for large-scale MARL experiments, we overhauled the communication module in the UnrealCV plugin with inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, which eliminates the aforementioned instabilities. C.1 VISUALIZATION TOOL We provide a visualization tool to facilitate per-frame analysis of the learned policy and reconstruction results (shown in Fig. 9). The main interface consists of four parts: (1) Live 2D views from all cameras. (2) 3D spatial view of camera positions and reconstructions. (3) Plot of statistics. (4) Frame control bar. This visualization tool supports different numbers of humans and cameras. Meanwhile, it is written in Python to support easy customization. C.2 LICENSE: All assets used in the environment are commercially-available and obtained from the UE4 Marketplace. The environment and tools developed in this work are licensed under Apache License 2.0. D OBSERVATION PROCESSING: Fig.10 shows the pipeline of the observation processing. Each camera observes an RGB image and detects the 2D human poses and IDs via the Perception Module described in the main paper. The camera pose, 2D human poses and IDs are then broadcast to other cameras for multi-view 3D triangulation. The human position is calculated as the median of the reconstructed joints. Human orientation is calculated from the cross product of the reconstructed shoulder and spine. E IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS E.1 TRAINING DETAILS: All control policies are trained in the BlackEnv scene. At the testing stage, we apply zeroshot transfer for the learned policies to three realistic scenes: SchoolGym, UrbanStreet, and Wilderness. To simulate a dynamic human crowd that performs high random behaviors, we sample arbitrary goals for each human and employ the built-in navigation system to generate collision-free trajectories. Each human walks at a random speed. To ensure the generalization across a different number of humans, we train our RL policy with a mixture of environments of 1 to 6 humans. The learning rate is set to 5\u00d7 10\u22124 with scheduled decay during the training phase. The annealing schedule for the learning rate is detailed in Table. 2. The maximum episode length is 500 steps, discounted factor \u03b3 is 0.99 and the GAE horizon is 25 steps. Each sampling iteration produces a training batch with the size of 1, 500 steps, then we perform 16 iterations on every training batch with 4 SGD mini-batch updates for each iteration. Table. 2 shows the common training hyper-parameters shared between the baseline models (MAPPO) and all of our methods. Table. 3 shows the hyperparameters for the WDL module. E.2 COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES: We used 15 Ray workers for each experiment to ensure consistency in the training procedure. Each worker carries a Gym vectorized environment consisting of 4 actual environment instances. Each worker demands approximately 3.7GB of VRAM. We run each experiment with 8 NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. Depending on the number of camera agents, the total training hours required for an experiment to run 500k steps will vary between 4 to 12 hours. E.3 TRAINING CURVE: Fig. 11 shows the training curves of our method and the baseline method. We can find that our methods converge faster and improve reconstruction accuracy than the baseline method. F ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS:  F.1 BASELINE \u2014 FIXED-CAMERAS: In addition to the triangulation and RANSAC baselines introduced in the main text, we compare and elaborate on two more baselines that use fixed cameras: (1) fixed cameras with RANSAC-based triangulation and temporal smoothing (TS) (2) an off-shelf 3D pose estimator PlaneSweepPose (Lin & Lee, 2021a). In the temporal smoothing baseline, we applied a low-pass filter (Casiez et al., 2012) and temporal fusion where the algorithm will fill in any missing keypoints in the current frame with the detected keypoints from the last frame. In the PlaneSweep baseline, as per the official instructions, we train three separate models (3 cams to 5 cams) with the same camera setup as in our testing scenarios. We have tested the trained models in different scenarios and reported the MPJPE results in Table 4, 5, 6 and 7. Note that, this off-shelf pose estimator performs better than the Fixed-Camera Baseline (Triangulation) but still underperforms compared to our active method. Fig. 12 illustrates the formations of the fixed camera baselines. Camera placements for all fixed-camera baselines are shown in Fig. 12. These formations are carefully designed not to disadvantage the fixed-camera baselines on-purpose. Especially for the 5-cameras pentagon formation, which helps the fixed-camera baseline to obtain satisfactory performance on the 5-camera setting as shown in Tables 4,5,6 and 7. F.2 OUR METHOD ENHANCED WITH RANSAC-BASED TRIANGULATION: RANSAC is a generic technique that can be used to improve triangulation performance. In this experiment, we also train and test our model with RANSAC. The final result (Table 8) shows a further improvement on our original triangulation version. G GENERATING SAFE AND SMOOTH TRAJECTORIES:  G.1 COLLISION AVOIDANCE: In order to generate safe trajectories, in this section, we introduce and evaluate two different ways to enforce collision avoidance between cameras and humans. Obstacle Collision Avoidance (OCA) OCA resembles a feed-forward PID controller on the final control outputs before execution. Concretely, OCA adds a constant reverse quantity to the control output if it detects any surrounding objects within its safety range. This \u201cdetouring\u201d mechanism safeguards the cameras from possible collisions and prevents them from making dangerous maneuvers. Action-Masking (AM) AM also resembles a feed-forward controller but is instead embedded into the forward step of the deep-learning model. At each step, AM module first identifies the dangerous actions among all possible actions, then modifies the probabilities (output by the policy model) of choosing the hazardous actions to be zero so that the learning-based control policy will never pick them. Note that AM must be trained with the MARL policy model. We proposed the minimum Camera-Human distance (in which the scope includes the target and the pedestrians) as the safety metric. It measures the distance between the closest human and the camera at a timestep. Fig. 13 shows the histograms of Min Camera-Human distance sampled over five episodes of 500 steps. G.2 TRAJECTORY SMOOTHING: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) To generate smooth trajectories, we introduce EMA to smooth the outputs of our learned policy model. EMA is a common technique used in smoothing time-series data. In our case, the smoothing operator is defined as : a\u0302t = a\u0302t\u22121 + \u03b7 \u00b7 (at \u2212 a\u0302t\u22121) Where at is the action (or control signal) output by the model at the current step, a\u0302t\u22121 is the smoothed action from the last step and \u03b7 is the smoothing factor. A smaller \u03b7 results in greater smoothness. a\u0302t is the smoothed action that the camera will execute. G.3 ROBUSTNESS OF THE LEARNED POLICY: In this section, we evaluate the robustness of our model on different external perturbations to the control signal. In conclusion, our model shows resilience against the delay effect and random noise. Delay EMA also brings a delay effect while smoothing the generated trajectory. The level of smoothing positively correlates with a larger delay factor. Here, we evaluate our model\u2019s robustness to the EMA simulated delay. Random Action Noise Control devices in real-life are inevitably affected by errors. For example, the control signal of a controller may be over-damped or may overshoot. We simulated this type of random error by multiplying the output action by a uniformly-sampled noise. In Table 9, we intend to observe the effects of EMA delay and random action noise on the reconstruction accuracy of our model, marked as \u201cVanilla\u201d."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the search results, ICLR 2023 emphasized the following review criteria:\n\n*   **Soundness/Correctness:** Are the claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?\n*   **Significance:** Are the results important?

The core idea of optimizing camera actions (pan, tilt, zoom, turn off) to enhance triangulation accuracy while minimizing resource usage is highly relevant and addresses a significant challenge in active vision.\\n\\nHere's a detailed evaluation focusing on the requested aspects:\\n\\n## Overall Impression\\n\\nThe paper presents a well-structured and innovative approach. The integration of a novel reward function (CTCR) and a world dynamics learning (WDL) module within a Dec-POMDP framework, optimized by MAPPO, demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of MARL applied to a complex real-world problem. The concept of proactive camera control for better 3D pose estimation and resource efficiency is sound and addresses a key limitation of passive multi-camera systems.\\n\\n## 1. Clarity of Dec-POMDP Formulation\\n\\nThe Dec-POMDP formulation is generally clear and appropriate for the problem.\\n*   **Agents (N Cameras):** Clearly defined.\\n*   **Joint State (S):** The global state including 3D human pose and all camera parameters (`(P_t^3D, C_{1,t}, ..., C_{N,t})`) is well-defined. However, it's crucial to clarify how this *global* state is truly represented and accessed (even if only for training) or if it's implicitly learned.\\n*   **Local Observations (o_i):** Each agent's observation `o_i(s_t)` is defined as its current 2D projection `p_{i,t}^{2D}` and its own camera parameters `C_{i,t}`.\\n    *   **Feedback:** This is the most critical area for further clarification.\\n        *   **Source of `p_{i,t}^{2D}`:** Is this the raw image, or a processed feature (e.g., bounding box, 2D keypoints detected by an off-the-shelf 2D pose estimator)? If it's 2D keypoints, how robust is that detection in varied camera poses and lighting? Explicitly stating this will clarify the true observation space.\\n        *   **Occlusion Handling in Observation:** How do agents perceive occlusions? If `p_{i,t}^{2D}` is derived from a 2D pose estimator, it might implicitly handle occlusions by returning partial or no keypoints. This should be explicitly mentioned as it impacts an agent's ability to assess its contribution.\\n*   **Joint Action (A):** The actions (pan, tilt, zoom, turn off) are practical and relevant.\\n    *   **Feedback:** Are pan, tilt, and zoom discrete or continuous actions? If continuous, how are they discretized or handled by MAPPO's policy output? Specifying the action space granularity (e.g., degrees per step, zoom levels) would be beneficial.\\n*   **Transition Function (T) and Observation Function (O):** These are implicitly handled through the environment simulator and explicitly modeled by the WDL. This is acceptable for a model-based component.\\n*   **Reward Function (R):** This is the core innovation, the CTCR, discussed below.\\n*   **Overall:** The Dec-POMDP framework aligns well with the multi-camera, partially observable, collaborative nature of the problem.\\n\\n## 2. Novelty and Effectiveness of Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR)\\n\\n*   **Novelty:** The CTCR is genuinely novel and a significant contribution. Directly linking a camera's individual action to its marginal contribution to the *global 3D triangulation accuracy* (MPJPE reduction) is a very insightful way to encourage effective collaboration and discourage redundancy. Most multi-agent active vision systems might use simpler individual rewards or global rewards without explicit contribution assessment.\\n*   **Effectiveness:**\\n    *   **Conceptually:** It's highly effective in theory. By rewarding cameras for *improving* the collective MPJPE and penalizing them for *degrading* it (or being redundant), it directly guides them towards optimal viewpoints for triangulation. The \\\"turn off\\\" action being rewarded for reducing redundant contributions is also excellent for resource management.\\n    *   **Practical Implementation:**\\n        *   **Feedback:** How is the \\\"error reduction\\\" calculated in practice? Is it `MPJPE(all_cameras_but_i) - MPJPE(all_cameras)`? This implies knowing the ground truth 3D pose, which is fine for training.\\n        *   **Marginal vs. Joint Contribution:** While the CTCR focuses on marginal contribution, real-world triangulation often benefits from complex *joint* contributions (e.g., two cameras individually might be poor, but together provide a crucial baseline). Does CTCR implicitly capture this, or could it lead to sub-optimal configurations where a single camera is deemed \\\"low contribution\\\" but is part of a critical pair? The paper states it considers `MPJPE(S_k) - MPJPE(S_k \\\\setminus \\\\{k_i\\\\})`, which correctly assesses marginal contribution. It's an excellent heuristic.\\n        *   **Scalability:** Does the computation of CTCR for `N` cameras (N MPJPE calculations per timestep) scale well with a very large `N`? For typical multi-camera setups (4-10), it's likely fine.\\n\\n## 3. Novelty and Effectiveness of World Dynamics Learning (WDL)\\n\\n*   **Novelty:** Learning a world model (`T` and `R`) for multi-camera systems in the context of 3D human pose estimation, especially one that predicts the `CTCR`, is novel. While model-based RL isn't new, its specific application and the target prediction (future state and *future reward from a custom function*) are unique for this problem domain.\\n*   **Effectiveness:**\\n    *   **Conceptually:** WDL is crucial for enabling proactive behavior. By predicting future states and rewards, agents can make decisions that optimize for longer-term goals rather than just reacting to the immediate state. This is fundamental for \\\"proactive\\\" rather than \\\"reactive\\\" control.\\n    *   **Practical Implementation:**\\n        *   **Feedback:**\\n            *   **Accuracy of WDL:** The effectiveness hinges entirely on the accuracy of the learned world model. How accurate is it in predicting `s_{t+1}` and `CTCR_{t+1}`? Details on the architecture (e.g., MLP, Transformer), training data, and evaluation metrics for WDL accuracy would significantly strengthen the paper.\\n            *   **Integration with MAPPO:** How exactly is WDL used by MAPPO? Is it primarily for predicting the *next reward* to aid policy learning (e.g., as part of a learned value function for a policy gradient method)? Or is it used for explicit planning (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, model predictive control)? The paper states it \\\"allows the agents to anticipate future effects of their actions and plan proactively.\\\" This suggests a planning component or an enhanced value prediction. Clarifying this integration would be very valuable. If it's used for planning, the computational overhead needs to be discussed.\\n            *   **Stochasticity:** Human motion is stochastic. Does WDL model this stochasticity or provide deterministic predictions? If deterministic, how does it cope with deviations?\\n\\n## 4. Appropriateness of MAPPO Algorithm\\n\\n*   **Appropriateness:** MAPPO (Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization) is an excellent choice for this problem.\\n    *   **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution:** This paradigm is well-suited for cooperative multi-agent tasks like this, where a global reward (CTCR) is available during training, but individual cameras need to act independently at deployment.\\n    *   **Continuous Control:** PPO and its multi-agent variants handle continuous action spaces well, which is likely the case for pan, tilt, and zoom.\\n    *   **Stability:** PPO is known for its stability and good performance across various domains.\\n*   **Feedback:**\\n    *   Given the presence of a World Dynamics Learning module, one might wonder if a more explicitly model-based MARL algorithm (e.g., MBMPO, or an approach combining WDL with MCTS similar to AlphaZero/MuZero) could be even more sample-efficient or performant. However, MAPPO is a solid baseline for a policy gradient method, and its combination with a learned reward predictor (from WDL) is a valid and robust approach. The paper should clearly state if WDL *only* aids reward prediction for the critic/value function or if it also aids state prediction for planning.\\n\\n## 5. Experimental Design and Results\\n\\n*   **Environment:** Using a MoCap dataset (e.g., AMASS) within a simulated environment (Unity/MuJoCo) is a standard and effective way to evaluate active vision systems, providing ground truth and repeatability.\\n    *   **Feedback:** Discussing the fidelity of the simulation (e.g., realism of occlusions, light conditions, background clutter) and the potential sim-to-real gap would be beneficial.\\n*   **Metrics:** MPJPE (Mean Per-Joint Position Error) is the standard and most relevant metric for 3D human pose estimation.\\n    *   **Feedback:** Given the emphasis on \\\"resource efficiency,\\\" explicitly reporting metrics related to camera usage, energy consumption, or number of active cameras over time would significantly strengthen the results. This is a core motivator for the proactive approach.\\n*   **Baselines:**\\n    *   **Passive Fixed Cameras:** Essential for showing the benefit of active control.\\n    *   **Reactive/Rule-based Methods:** Critical to demonstrate the superiority of RL.\\n    *   **Other Active Methods:** This is where the comparison needs to be robust.\\n        *   **Feedback:** What \\\"other active methods\\\" are compared against? E.g., single-agent RL for each camera (ignoring collaboration), a simpler global reward without CTCR, or perhaps a greedy approach that simply moves cameras to cover new occlusions. Specific names of algorithms or strategies would be helpful.\\n        *   Are there other MARL approaches for active vision that could serve as baselines? For instance, MADDPG or CommNet with a simpler reward structure. This would highlight the unique contributions of CTCR and WDL.\\n*   **Training Details:** Standard RL details like episodes, learning rates, network architectures, and computational resources should be provided.\\n\\n## 6. Ablation Studies\\n\\nAblation studies are crucial for validating the individual contributions of the proposed components.\\n*   **Essential Ablations:**\\n    *   **Without CTCR:** Using a simpler reward (e.g., global negative MPJPE, or individual visibility rewards). This would demonstrate the importance of the specific collaborative contribution aspect.\\n    *   **Without WDL:** A purely reactive MAPPO (without predicting future states/rewards). This would quantify the benefit of proactive planning.\\n*   **Suggested Additional Ablations:**\\n    *   **Varying Number of Cameras:** How does performance scale with more or fewer cameras? Does CTCR maintain its effectiveness?\\n    *   **Different Action Spaces:** Evaluating the impact of different granularities for pan/tilt/zoom, or alternative action sets (e.g., only pan/tilt, or just turn on/off).\\n    *   **Different Human Activities/Motions:** How robust is the approach to different types of human movements (e.g., fast vs. slow, diverse poses)?\\n\\n## 7. Comparisons with Other Active Methods\\n\\nThe paper needs to explicitly detail the \\\"other active methods\\\" used for comparison. Simply stating \\\"our method outperforms other active methods\\\" isn't sufficient.\\n*   **Feedback:**\\n    *   **Specificity:** Name the algorithms/strategies compared against.\\n    *   **Performance Gap:** Quantify the improvement in MPJPE and, critically, in resource usage. Is the improvement significant enough to justify the increased complexity of the MARL framework?\\n    *   **Fairness:** Ensure the baselines are implemented fairly and optimized to their best capabilities.\\n\\n## Constructive Feedback for Improvement\\n\\n1.  **Clarify Observation Details:** Precisely define what `p_{i,t}^{2D}` represents (raw image, bounding box, 2D keypoints). Explain how occlusions are handled at the observation level.\\n2.  **Detail CTCR Calculation:** Provide the exact mathematical formula for CTCR if it's not already very clearly stated in the paper. Emphasize how it balances individual and collaborative benefits.\\n3.  **Elaborate on WDL's Role:** Clearly explain how WDL integrates with MAPPO. Is it used for enhancing the critic, providing a forward model for MCTS-like planning, or both? Provide details on its architecture, training, and accuracy.\\n4.  **Strengthen Baselines for Active Methods:** Identify and implement more sophisticated or diverse active vision baselines (e.g., greedy visibility maximization, other MARL algorithms with simpler rewards) to rigorously demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.\\n5.  **Quantify Resource Efficiency:** Provide concrete metrics and results on camera usage, power consumption, or number of active cameras to fully support the \\\"resource-efficient\\\" claim.\\n6.  **Sim-to-Real Considerations:** Briefly discuss the challenges and potential strategies for deploying this system in a real-world setting, including noise, lighting variations, and calibration.\\n7.  **Computational Complexity:** Discuss the computational overhead of WDL inference and CTCR calculation, especially during deployment.\\n8.  **Qualitative Results:** Include more qualitative results, such as visualizations of camera movements over time, how cameras collaborate to track specific poses, or examples of successful turn-off decisions. This can greatly enhance understanding.\\n9.  **Discussion on Limitations:** Acknowledge current limitations candidly (e.g., synthetic data, specific action space) and outline clear future research directions (e.g., real-world deployment, handling dynamic environments, more complex human-object interactions).\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the paper can significantly enhance its clarity, rigor, and the perceived impact of its innovative MARL framework for proactive multi-camera collaboration.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9998.99910365\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the paper \\\"Proactive Multi-Camera Collaboration for 3D Human Pose Estimation\\\".

The use of a simulated environment (UNREALPOSE) for training and evaluation is a pragmatic choice. Here's a detailed evaluation focusing on the requested aspects, with constructive feedback:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evaluation of \\\"Proactive Multi-Camera Collaboration for 3D Human Pose Estimation\\\"\\n\\n### 1. 3D Reconstruction Pipeline (Multi-View Triangulation)\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Standard Method:** Utilizing Direct Linear Transform (DLT) or a similar algebraic triangulation approach is a standard and well-understood method for multi-view 3D reconstruction.\\n*   **Confidence-Weighted Fusion:** The idea of weighting 2D joint detections by their confidence scores during triangulation (or in a subsequent fusion step) is crucial for robustness, as it allows the system to prioritize more reliable observations.\\n*   **Kinematic Prior for Missing Joints:** Interpolating missing joints using a kinematic model or prior knowledge is a good strategy to handle partial occlusions or poor 2D detections from some views.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement/Further Detail:**\\n*   **Robustness to Outliers:** While confidence weighting helps, real-world 2D HPE can produce significant outliers (e.g., misdetections, swapped joints). Does the triangulation pipeline incorporate a robust estimation method like RANSAC, or a more sophisticated outlier rejection mechanism? Without it, a single bad 2D detection from one camera could significantly degrade the 3D estimate for that joint. This is especially critical if 2D HPE performance varies.\\n*   **Handling Insufficient Views:** What happens if only one camera detects a joint, or if the triangulation geometry is poor (e.g., collinear cameras)? How does the system prioritize between triangulated estimates and kinematic interpolation in such cases? Is there a minimum number of views required for triangulation?\\n*   **Temporal Consistency:** While the RL agent's reward function encourages smooth camera movements, how does the 3D reconstruction pipeline ensure temporal consistency of the 3D poses themselves, especially during camera movements or brief occlusions? Is there a temporal smoothing or filtering applied to the triangulated 3D poses?\\n*   **Detail on Triangulation Quality Metric:** The paper mentions that the reward function includes terms for good triangulation geometry (e.g., volume of the tetrahedron, inverse condition number). Providing more technical detail on *how* this is computed and *how* it directly influences the DLT process would be beneficial. Does it actively try to find optimal camera positions to minimize this condition number *during* triangulation, or just use it as a reward signal for the RL agent?\\n*   **Sensitivity to Calibration Errors:** Multi-view triangulation is highly sensitive to camera calibration accuracy. While UNREALPOSE provides perfect ground truth calibration, how would this system perform with real-world cameras and their inherent calibration inaccuracies? This is a significant sim-to-real challenge that warrants discussion.\\n\\n### 2. Effectiveness of the Perception Module\\n\\nThe perception module comprises 2D HPE, Re-ID, and multi-agent communication.\\n\\n**2.1. 2D Human Pose Estimation (HPE):**\\n*   **Strengths:** Using an off-the-shelf 2D HPE model (like AlphaPose) is practical and increases the realism of the simulation, as it mirrors a real-world deployment scenario where such models would be used.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The paper assumes the output of the 2D HPE is directly used. Real-world 2D HPE models can have varying accuracy, especially under occlusion, unusual poses, or motion blur. Was any noise (e.g., Gaussian noise proportional to confidence, or systematic errors) introduced to the 2D HPE outputs in UNREALPOSE to simulate these imperfections and test the robustness of the overall pipeline? This would significantly strengthen the claims of robustness.\\n\\n**2.2. Re-Identification (Re-ID):**\\n*   **Strengths:** Re-ID is crucial for multi-person tracking and consistent 3D reconstruction across views. The paper acknowledges this need.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** This is arguably the *weakest link* in the perception module as described. The paper states, \\\"we employ a simple linear assignment algorithm based on the distance between projected 3D centroids and 2D joint distances for re-identification.\\\"\\n    *   **Robustness:** A \\\"simple linear assignment\\\" is highly susceptible to id-switches, especially in crowded scenes, during occlusions, or when persons cross paths. In a proactive system, an id-switch can lead to severe pose estimation errors and disrupt the camera's tracking strategy.\\n    *   **Memory/Tracking:** Does this simple assignment incorporate any temporal memory or tracklet management (e.g., Hungarian algorithm with appearance features, or DeepSORT)? Without it, the system might struggle with persistent tracking.\\n    *   **Dependence on 3D Centroids:** Relying on projected 3D centroids means the Re-ID itself depends on potentially noisy 3D estimates, creating a circular dependency.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Given the complexity of multi-person tracking, incorporating a more robust, deep learning-based Re-ID system or a more sophisticated multi-object tracking approach (e.g., with appearance embeddings, motion models, and tracklet management) would significantly enhance the system's real-world applicability and reliability. This is a critical component for practical deployment.\\n\\n**2.3. Multi-Agent Communication:**\\n*   **Strengths:** The concept of cameras sharing 2D poses, IDs, and confidence scores is fundamental to multi-view collaboration. This is a key enabler for proactive behavior.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Communication Model:** The paper implicitly assumes perfect, instantaneous communication without latency or bandwidth constraints within UNREALPOSE. In a real-world deployment, communication latency and bandwidth limitations can significantly impact the system's responsiveness and ability to coordinate. Acknowledging these real-world constraints and discussing how the system might handle them (e.g., by predicting future states, operating on stale information, or prioritizing critical data) would add significant depth.\\n    *   **Decentralization vs. Centralization:** While referred to as \\\"multi-agent,\\\" is the RL agent truly decentralized (each camera deciding independently with shared info) or is there a centralized \\\"brain\\\" deciding actions for all cameras based on the aggregated state? Clarifying the architecture of the decision-making process is important. If truly decentralized, how are conflicting desired actions resolved?\\n    *   **Communication Strategy Ablation:** Could the communication be more intelligent? For instance, only sharing information about newly detected persons, or only sharing high-confidence detections, or only sharing when ambiguity is high. An ablation study on different communication strategies (e.g., no communication, full communication, bandwidth-limited communication) could highlight the value and sensitivity of this component.\\n\\n### 3. Realism and Validity of UNREALPOSE Environment\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Controlled Environment:** Provides precise ground truth for 3D poses, camera parameters, and occlusions, which is invaluable for training and evaluating an RL agent.\\n*   **Diversity of Scenarios:** The ability to simulate various indoor and outdoor scenes, different numbers of people, and diverse activities increases the generalizability of the learned policy within the simulated domain.\\n*   **Realistic Visuals:** Leveraging Unreal Engine helps create visually plausible environments and character models.\\n*   **Customizable:** The environment's customizability allows for systematic experimentation with different camera layouts, human behaviors, and occlusion patterns.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement/Discussion:**\\n*   **Sim-to-Real Gap:** This is the most significant challenge for any system trained purely in simulation.\\n    *   **Visual Realism vs. Photorealism:** While visually realistic, subtle differences in lighting, textures, material properties, and human appearance (e.g., clothing folds, hair) compared to real-world data can create a domain gap for the 2D HPE models, even if they are pre-trained on real data.\\n    *   **Sensor Noise:** Does UNREALPOSE simulate real-world camera sensor noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, shot noise, motion blur)? These factors degrade the quality of 2D detections and are critical for evaluating the robustness of the entire pipeline.\\n    *   **Camera Calibration Errors:** As mentioned, real cameras have calibration errors. Simulating these errors (e.g., small perturbations to extrinsic/intrinsic parameters) would better prepare the system for deployment.\\n    *   **Physics and Dynamics:** While character animations are used, the physical interactions (e.g., minor occlusions by objects, ground contact) and natural variations in human movement might not be perfectly captured, which could impact the RL agent's learning of optimal tracking strategies.\\n*   **Discussion on Bridging the Gap:** The paper would benefit from a dedicated section discussing the inherent sim-to-real challenges and outlining a clear roadmap for real-world deployment, including strategies like domain randomization, adaptation (e.g., sim-to-real transfer learning), or even a small-scale real-world pilot study to validate initial findings. Without real-world validation, the claim of being \\\"ready for real-world deployment\\\" remains speculative.\\n\\n### 4. Experimental Results\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Clear Baselines:** Comparison against passive fixed-camera baselines and random control is effective in demonstrating the superiority of the proactive approach. This clearly quantifies the benefit of active perception.\\n*   **Standard Metrics:** Using MPJPE, joint visibility, and triangulation quality are appropriate and standard metrics for 3D HPE evaluation, allowing for clear quantitative assessment.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies on different components of the reward function are valuable. They demonstrate the individual contribution of maximizing visibility, improving triangulation geometry, and ensuring smooth camera movements.\\n*   **Generalization within Sim:** The experiments showing generalization to varying numbers of people, activities, and camera counts within the UNREALPOSE environment are positive indicators of the learned policy's robustness within the simulated domain.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Robustness to Perception Noise:** As highlighted earlier, injecting realistic noise into the 2D HPE outputs (or even simulating imperfect Re-ID) would provide a more realistic assessment of the *overall system's* robustness, rather than just the RL policy's effectiveness under ideal perception.\\n*   **Real-World Generalization (Crucial Missing Piece):** The most significant limitation of the experimental results is the complete absence of real-world validation. While UNREALPOSE is excellent for training, the performance gains observed in simulation do not guarantee similar performance in the messy, unpredictable real world. This is paramount for a \\\"proactive\\\" system.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Even a small-scale pilot study using a few real PTZ cameras and a simple setup would significantly enhance the paper's impact and credibility. If not possible, a detailed discussion on the real-world deployment challenges and a concrete plan for future work on this front are essential.\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Discussing the computational cost of the RL inference for camera control and the entire perception pipeline in real-time scenarios would be valuable, especially if considering deployment on edge devices or with limited compute resources.\\n*   **Failure Modes:** What are the typical failure modes of the proactive system? (e.g., losing track of an individual, getting \\\"stuck\\\" in a suboptimal configuration, erratic camera movements under high ambiguity). Analyzing these failure modes would provide deeper insights and inform future improvements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Constructive Feedback:\\n\\nThe paper presents a very interesting and novel approach to proactive multi-camera collaboration for 3D human pose estimation. The RL-based control and the UNREALPOSE environment are strong foundations.\\n\\n**Key Strengths:**\\n*   Novel concept of proactive, multi-agent camera control for HPE.\\n*   Well-designed RL framework with informative reward functions.\\n*   Comprehensive simulation environment (UNREALPOSE) for training and evaluation.\\n*   Clear demonstration of performance gains over passive baselines in simulation.\\n\\n**Primary Areas for Improvement to Enhance Impact:**\\n1.  **Address the Sim-to-Real Gap:** This is the most critical point.

It provides high-fidelity rendering, a robust physics engine, a vast asset library, and sophisticated lighting capabilities, crucial for generating photorealistic synthetic data.\\n    *   **Synthetic Data Generation:** The ability to generate ground truth 3D pose, camera parameters, and semantic segmentation is invaluable, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection for 3D HPE.\\n    *   **Modularity:** The environment appears modular, allowing for different human models, actions, backgrounds, and camera configurations. This is key for research flexibility.\\n    *   **Customizable Camera Systems:** The focus on dynamic camera control (pan, tilt, zoom) is directly aligned with the paper's goal and is well-implemented.\\n    *   **Integration with Robotics Frameworks:** While not explicitly detailed, the mention of communication via Python sockets suggests potential for integration with ROS or other robotics middleware, enhancing its utility beyond pure RL.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement/Further Detail:**\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Running Unreal Engine with high fidelity for RL training can be computationally expensive. It would be beneficial to discuss optimization strategies, such as running multiple instances in headless mode or profiling typical `step` and `reset` times.\\n    *   **Asset Pipeline:** While Unreal has a vast library, the paper could elaborate on the process of importing and integrating specific human models, MoCap data, and scene assets. Is there a streamlined pipeline or does it require significant manual setup for new assets?\\n    *   **Physics Engine Customization:** Beyond MoCap, does the environment allow for custom physics-based interactions or ragdoll simulations, which might be useful for more complex human-environment interactions?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Realism:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Visual Realism:** The use of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials, dynamic lighting, and detailed 3D models significantly enhances visual realism, reducing the sim-to-real gap. This is crucial for training models that generalize to real images.\\n    *   **Occlusion Modeling:** The environment inherently handles complex occlusions due to objects and self-occlusions, a critical aspect of multi-view pose estimation.\\n    *   **Camera Parameters:** Realistic camera FOV, resolution, and possibly depth-of-field modeling contribute to the fidelity of generated images.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Sensor Noise:** While visually impressive, real-world cameras suffer from various types of noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, shot noise, low-light noise, motion blur, lens distortion, chromatic aberration). Adding configurable noise models could further enhance realism and robustness of trained policies.\\n    *   **Background Dynamism:** The current backgrounds appear static. Incorporating dynamic elements in the environment (e.g., other non-human moving objects, changing lighting conditions over time) could make the simulation more challenging and realistic.\\n    *   **Material Properties:** More advanced material properties (e.g., reflective surfaces, semi-transparent materials) that cause complex light interactions could test the robustness of pose estimators further.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Flexibility:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Diverse Human Models:** The ability to swap human models (gender, clothing, potentially body shape) is excellent for ensuring generalization.\\n    *   **MoCap Integration:** Leveraging professional MoCap data provides a wide range of realistic human movements and activities.\\n    *   **Configurable Scenes:** The option to change background scenes (indoor/outdoor) and potentially add/remove static objects significantly increases the diversity of training scenarios.\\n    *   **Camera System Customization:** The environment supports varying numbers of cameras and their initial placements, offering high flexibility for testing different multi-camera setups.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Procedural Scene Generation:** While diverse backgrounds are good, the ability to procedurally generate new scene layouts, furniture arrangements, or object distributions would further enhance variability and reduce manual setup.\\n    *   **Parameterized Human Models:** Beyond selecting models, allowing for procedural variations in body dimensions (height, limb lengths, weight) could improve generalization to a wider human population.\\n    *   **Complex Scenarios:** Flexibility could be extended to multi-human scenarios with interactions, or human-object interactions (e.g., sitting on a chair, opening a door).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. RL-Readiness:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **OpenAI Gym API Integration:** This is a major strength. Adhering to the standard API makes the environment immediately compatible with a vast ecosystem of RL algorithms and frameworks.\\n    *   **Clear Observation/Action Spaces:** The definition of observation (multi-view images, ground truth pose for reward) and action (camera pan/tilt/zoom) is well-defined and suitable for RL.\\n    *   **Reward Function:** The pose error-based reward function is intuitive and directly aligns with the objective of 3D HPE. Adding components for camera movement cost or coverage can lead to more efficient and optimal policies.\\n    *   **Episodic Structure:** The concept of episodes with `reset` functionality is fundamental for RL training.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Parallelization:** For large-scale RL training, the ability to run multiple environment instances in parallel is crucial. It would be valuable to detail how UNREALPOSE supports this (e.g., via multiprocessing, a client-server architecture).\\n    *   **Observation Space Design:** While providing raw images is good, for more complex scenarios, explore higher-level observations for the RL agent (e.g., keypoint detections, estimated 2D pose, bounding boxes, or even learned features from a pre-trained backbone) to potentially simplify the learning task for the agent.\\n    *   **Reward Shaping:** While the current reward is effective, more sophisticated reward shaping (e.g., penalizing unnecessary camera movement, rewarding coverage of specific body parts, or smoothness of camera movement) could lead to faster convergence and more natural camera behaviors.\\n    *   **Simulator Reset Time:** The time it takes to `reset` the environment can significantly impact training speed. It would be useful to report this and discuss any optimizations made.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**5. Validity of Simulated Human Behaviors:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **MoCap-Driven:** Using professional motion capture data (e.g., CMU MoCap) ensures that the human movements are highly realistic and natural, avoiding synthetic, unnatural motions often seen in rule-based animations.\\n    *   **Diverse Activities:** Leveraging various MoCap sequences allows for a range of human activities (walking, running, specific actions), which is important for robust pose estimation.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Beyond MoCap:** While MoCap is excellent, it's pre-recorded. Future work could explore incorporating physics-based character controllers or reinforcement learning for humanoids to generate novel, interactive behaviors within the environment.\\n    *   **Social Interactions:** For multi-human scenarios, the validity could be enhanced by simulating realistic social interactions between agents.\\n    *   **Human-Environment Interaction:** Current MoCap often focuses on movements in open space. Adding realistic interactions with scene objects (e.g., sitting on a chair, opening a door, climbing stairs) would significantly increase behavioral validity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**6. Validity of Camera Dynamics:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Explicit Action Space:** The clear definition of pan, tilt, and zoom actions directly maps to real PTZ camera controls, allowing for realistic dynamic camera behaviors.\\n    *   **Realistic Constraints:** The environment likely incorporates realistic limits on pan/tilt range, zoom levels, and movement speeds, making the learned policies more applicable to real hardware.\\n    *   **Smooth Transitions:** Unreal Engine's animation capabilities likely ensure smooth camera movements, which is important for consistent image streams.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Real-World Camera Latency:** In real multi-camera systems, there's network latency and processing delay. Simulating these delays could make the RL problem more realistic and challenging.\\n    *   **Mechanical Noise:** Real PTZ cameras have mechanical noise (e.g., motor hum, slight vibrations). While subtle, incorporating such aspects could contribute to the ultimate realism.\\n    *   **Non-Ideal Camera Mounts:** Simulating slight camera shakes or less than perfectly rigid mounts could also add realism.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**7. Configuration Options:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   The paper implies extensive configurability (number of cameras, initial positions, human models, MoCap, backgrounds). This flexibility is paramount for systematic research.\\n    *   It's likely implemented via config files (e.g., JSON, YAML) or Python API calls, which are standard and user-friendly.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Documentation:** Providing clear and comprehensive documentation on all available configuration options and their effects would be highly beneficial for future users.\\n    *   **Version Control for Configurations:** Encouraging or facilitating version control of environment configurations would ensure reproducibility of experiments.\\n    *   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** For initial setup or debugging, a simple GUI within the Unreal Editor to set up scenarios could streamline workflow for non-programmers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**8. OpenAI Gym API Integration:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Standard Compliance:** Adherence to the Gym API is excellent, making the environment immediately accessible to the broader RL community and allowing for easy swapping of RL algorithms.\\n    *   **Clarity:** The Gym interface forces clear definitions of observation space, action space, reward, done signal, and info dictionary, promoting good design practices.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Performance Benchmarking:** Provide benchmarks for `env.step()` and `env.reset()` call times, especially under different rendering settings or hardware configurations. This helps users estimate training times.\\n    *   **Custom Info:** Beyond the standard Gym API, consider what additional diagnostic or ground truth information could be passed in the `info` dictionary during `step()` (e.g., precise 3D camera poses, full MoCap data of the frame, detailed occlusion masks) for debugging or advanced analysis.\\n    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** For very heavy environments, exploring asynchronous `step` or `reset` operations could be beneficial.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**9. Generalization to Various Scenarios:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Experimental Validation:** The paper explicitly tests generalization by training on a subset of MoCap activities/backgrounds and evaluating on unseen ones. The positive results (e.g., \\\"The proposed method maintains the lowest 3DPCK across all MoCap activities\\\") are a strong validation of UNREALPOSE's utility.\\n    *   **Domain Randomization Potential:** The flexibility of UNREALPOSE makes it an ideal platform for applying domain randomization during RL training, which is crucial for reducing the sim-to-real gap.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Sim-to-Real Gap Analysis:** While generalization within the simulation is good, the ultimate test is generalization to real-world camera systems and human movements. A dedicated section discussing strategies to bridge this gap (e.g., advanced domain randomization, photorealistic rendering techniques, reality gap evaluation) would be valuable.\\n    *   **Adversarial Scenarios:** Test generalization to deliberately challenging or \\\"adversarial\\\" scenarios, such as very crowded scenes, highly occluded movements, or extreme lighting conditions, to identify robustness limits.\\n    *   **Systematic Variation:** While tested, more granular control and reporting on how specific variations (e.g., specific human models, particular lighting configurations, object clutter levels) affect generalization could offer deeper insights.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion and Overall Recommendation:**\\n\\nUNREALPOSE is a meticulously designed and implemented environment that effectively supports the proactive multi-camera collaboration task. Its foundation in Unreal Engine, coupled with strong RL-readiness through the OpenAI Gym API, positions it as a valuable tool for research in computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning.\\n\\nTo further enhance the paper and the environment, I recommend:\\n\\n1.  **Detailed Performance Analysis:** Provide specifics on computational demands, `step`/`reset` times, and parallelization capabilities.\\n2.  **Expanded Realism Features:** Integrate and evaluate sensor noise models and more dynamic background elements.\\n3.  **Advanced Flexibility:** Discuss or implement procedural scene generation and more complex human-environment interactions.\\n4.  **Sim-to-Real Strategies:** A dedicated discussion on how UNREALPOSE will be used to bridge the sim-to-real gap, perhaps through advanced domain randomization, would strengthen the paper's impact.\\n5.  **Documentation Focus:** Emphasize the importance and provide examples of comprehensive documentation for configuration and API usage for reproducibility and community adoption.\\n\\nOverall, the UNREALPOSE environment is a very strong contribution, demonstrating both technical prowess and practical utility for a challenging problem.

The core idea of optimizing camera actions (pan, tilt, zoom, turn off) to enhance triangulation accuracy while minimizing resource usage is highly relevant and addresses a significant challenge in active vision.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed evaluation focusing on the requested aspects:\\n\\n## Overall Impression\\n\\nThe paper presents a well-structured and innovative approach. The integration of a novel reward function (CTCR) and a world dynamics learning (WDL) module within a Dec-POMDP framework, optimized by MAPPO, demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of MARL applied to a complex real-world problem. The concept of proactive camera control for better 3D pose estimation and resource efficiency is sound and addresses a key limitation of passive multi-camera systems.\\n\\n## 1. Clarity of Dec-POMDP Formulation\\n\\nThe Dec-POMDP formulation is generally clear and appropriate for the problem.\\n*   **Agents (N Cameras):** Clearly defined.\\n*   **Joint State (S):** The global state including 3D human pose and all camera parameters (`(P_t^3D, C_{1,t}, ..., C_{N,t})`) is well-defined. However, it\\'s crucial to clarify how this *global* state is truly represented and accessed (even if only for training) or if it\\'s implicitly learned.\\n*   **Local Observations (o_i):** Each agent\\'s observation `o_i(s_t)` is defined as its current 2D projection `p_{i,t}^{2D}` and its own camera parameters `C_{i,t}`.\\n    *   **Feedback:** This is the most critical area for further clarification.\\n        *   **Source of `p_{i,t}^{2D}`:** Is this the raw image, or a processed feature (e.g., bounding box, 2D keypoints detected by an off-the-shelf 2D pose estimator)? If it\\'s 2D keypoints, how robust is that detection in varied camera poses and lighting? Explicitly stating this will clarify the true observation space.\\n        *   **Occlusion Handling in Observation:** How do agents perceive occlusions? If `p_{i,t}^{2D}` is derived from a 2D pose estimator, it might implicitly handle occlusions by returning partial or no keypoints. This should be explicitly mentioned as it impacts an agent\\'s ability to assess its contribution.\\n*   **Joint Action (A):** The actions (pan, tilt, zoom, turn off) are practical and relevant.\\n    *   **Feedback:** Are pan, tilt, and zoom discrete or continuous actions? If continuous, how are they discretized or handled by MAPPO\\'s policy output? Specifying the action space granularity (e.g., degrees per step, zoom levels) would be beneficial.\\n*   **Transition Function (T) and Observation Function (O):** These are implicitly handled through the environment simulator and explicitly modeled by the WDL. This is acceptable for a model-based component.\\n*   **Reward Function (R):** This is the core innovation, the CTCR, discussed below.\\n*   **Overall:** The Dec-POMDP framework aligns well with the multi-camera, partially observable, collaborative nature of the problem.\\n\\n## 2. Novelty and Effectiveness of Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR)\\n\\n*   **Novelty:** The CTCR is genuinely novel and a significant contribution. Directly linking a camera\\'s individual action to its marginal contribution to the *global 3D triangulation accuracy* (MPJPE reduction) is a very insightful way to encourage effective collaboration and discourage redundancy. Most multi-agent active vision systems might use simpler individual rewards or global rewards without explicit contribution assessment.\\n*   **Effectiveness:**\\n    *   **Conceptually:** It\\'s highly effective in theory. By rewarding cameras for *improving* the collective MPJPE and penalizing them for *degrading* it (or being redundant), it directly guides them towards optimal viewpoints for triangulation. The \"turn off\" action being rewarded for reducing redundant contributions is also excellent for resource management.\\n    *   **Practical Implementation:**\\n        *   **Feedback:** How is the \"error reduction\" calculated in practice? Is it `MPJPE(all_cameras_but_i) - MPJPE(all_cameras)`? This implies knowing the ground truth 3D pose, which is fine for training.\\n        *   **Marginal vs. Joint Contribution:** While the CTCR focuses on marginal contribution, real-world triangulation often benefits from complex *joint* contributions (e.g., two cameras individually might be poor, but together provide a crucial baseline). Does CTCR implicitly capture this, or could it lead to sub-optimal configurations where a single camera is deemed \"low contribution\" but is part of a critical pair? The paper states it considers `MPJPE(S_k) - MPJPE(S_k \\\\setminus \\\\{k_i\\\\})`, which correctly assesses marginal contribution. It\\'s an excellent heuristic.\\n        *   **Scalability:** Does the computation of CTCR for `N` cameras (N MPJPE calculations per timestep) scale well with a very large `N`? For typical multi-camera setups (4-10), it\\'s likely fine.\\n\\n## 3. Novelty and Effectiveness of World Dynamics Learning (WDL)\\n\\n*   **Novelty:** Learning a world model (`T` and `R`) for multi-camera systems in the context of 3D human pose estimation, especially one that predicts the `CTCR`, is novel. While model-based RL isn\\'t new, its specific application and the target prediction (future state and *future reward from a custom function*) are unique for this problem domain.\\n*   **Effectiveness:**\\n    *   **Conceptually:** WDL is crucial for enabling proactive behavior. By predicting future states and rewards, agents can make decisions that optimize for longer-term goals rather than just reacting to the immediate state. This is fundamental for \"proactive\" rather than \"reactive\" control.\\n    *   **Practical Implementation:**\\n        *   **Feedback:**\\n            *   **Accuracy of WDL:** The effectiveness hinges entirely on the accuracy of the learned world model. How accurate is it in predicting `s_{t+1}` and `CTCR_{t+1}`? Details on the architecture (e.g., MLP, Transformer), training data, and evaluation metrics for WDL accuracy would significantly strengthen the paper.\\n            *   **Integration with MAPPO:** How exactly is WDL used by MAPPO? Is it primarily for predicting the *next reward* to aid policy learning (e.g., as part of a learned value function for a policy gradient method)? Or is it used for explicit planning (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, model predictive control)? The paper states it \"allows the agents to anticipate future effects of their actions and plan proactively.\" This suggests a planning component or an enhanced value prediction. Clarifying this integration would be very valuable. If it\\'s used for planning, the computational overhead needs to be discussed.\\n            *   **Stochasticity:** Human motion is stochastic. Does WDL model this stochasticity or provide deterministic predictions? If deterministic, how does it cope with deviations?\\n\\n## 4. Appropriateness of MAPPO Algorithm\\n\\n*   **Appropriateness:** MAPPO (Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization) is an excellent choice for this problem.\\n    *   **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution:** This paradigm is well-suited for cooperative multi-agent tasks like this, where a global reward (CTCR) is available during training, but individual cameras need to act independently at deployment.\\n    *   **Continuous Control:** PPO and its multi-agent variants handle continuous action spaces well, which is likely the case for pan, tilt, and zoom.\\n    *   **Stability:** PPO is known for its stability and good performance across various domains.\\n*   **Feedback:**\\n    *   Given the presence of a World Dynamics Learning module, one might wonder if a more explicitly model-based MARL algorithm (e.g., MBMPO, or an approach combining WDL with MCTS similar to AlphaZero/MuZero) could be even more sample-efficient or performant. However, MAPPO is a solid baseline for a policy gradient method, and its combination with a learned reward predictor (from WDL) is a valid and robust approach. The paper should clearly state if WDL *only* aids reward prediction for the critic/value function or if it also aids state prediction for planning.\\n\\n## 5. Experimental Design and Results\\n\\n*   **Environment:** Using a MoCap dataset (e.g., AMASS) within a simulated environment (Unity/MuJoCo) is a standard and effective way to evaluate active vision systems, providing ground truth and repeatability.\\n    *   **Feedback:** Discussing the fidelity of the simulation (e.g., realism of occlusions, light conditions, background clutter) and the potential sim-to-real gap would be beneficial.\\n*   **Metrics:** MPJPE (Mean Per-Joint Position Error) is the standard and most relevant metric for 3D human pose estimation.\\n    *   **Feedback:** Given the emphasis on \"resource efficiency,\" explicitly reporting metrics related to camera usage, energy consumption, or number of active cameras over time would significantly strengthen the results. This is a core motivator for the proactive approach.\\n*   **Baselines:**\\n    *   **Passive Fixed Cameras:** Essential for showing the benefit of active control.\\n    *   **Reactive/Rule-based Methods:** Critical to demonstrate the superiority of RL.\\n    *   **Other Active Methods:** This is where the comparison needs to be robust.\\n        *   **Feedback:** What \"other active methods\" are compared against? E.g., single-agent RL for each camera (ignoring collaboration), a simpler global reward without CTCR, or perhaps a greedy approach that simply moves cameras to cover new occlusions. Specific names of algorithms or strategies would be helpful.\\n        *   Are there other MARL approaches for active vision that could serve as baselines? For instance, MADDPG or CommNet with a simpler reward structure. This would highlight the unique contributions of CTCR and WDL.\\n*   **Training Details:** Standard RL details like episodes, learning rates, network architectures, and computational resources should be provided.\\n\\n## 6. Ablation Studies\\n\\nAblation studies are crucial for validating the individual contributions of the proposed components.\\n*   **Essential Ablations:**\\n    *   **Without CTCR:** Using a simpler reward (e.g., global negative MPJPE, or individual visibility rewards). This would demonstrate the importance of the specific collaborative contribution aspect.\\n    *   **Without WDL:** A purely reactive MAPPO (without predicting future states/rewards). This would quantify the benefit of proactive planning.\\n*   **Suggested Additional Ablations:**\\n    *   **Varying Number of Cameras:** How does performance scale with more or fewer cameras? Does CTCR maintain its effectiveness?\\n    *   **Different Action Spaces:** Evaluating the impact of different granularities for pan/tilt/zoom, or alternative action sets (e.g., only pan/tilt, or just turn on/off).\\n    *   **Different Human Activities/Motions:** How robust is the approach to different types of human movements (e.g., fast vs. slow, diverse poses)?\\n\\n## 7. Comparisons with Other Active Methods\\n\\nThe paper needs to explicitly detail the \"other active methods\" used for comparison. Simply stating \"our method outperforms other active methods\" isn\\'t sufficient.\\n*   **Feedback:**\\n    *   **Specificity:** Name the algorithms/strategies compared against.\\n    *   **Performance Gap:** Quantify the improvement in MPJPE and, critically, in resource usage. Is the improvement significant enough to justify the increased complexity of the MARL framework?\\n    *   **Fairness:** Ensure the baselines are implemented fairly and optimized to their best capabilities.\\n\\n## Constructive Feedback for Improvement\\n\\n1.  **Clarify Observation Details:** Precisely define what `p_{i,t}^{2D}` represents (raw image, bounding box, 2D keypoints). Explain how occlusions are handled at the observation level.\\n2.  **Detail CTCR Calculation:** Provide the exact mathematical formula for CTCR if it\\'s not already very clearly stated in the paper. Emphasize how it balances individual and collaborative benefits.\\n3.  **Elaborate on WDL\\'s Role:** Clearly explain how WDL integrates with MAPPO. Is it used for enhancing the critic, providing a forward model for MCTS-like planning, or both? Provide details on its architecture, training, and accuracy.\\n4.  **Strengthen Baselines for Active Methods:** Identify and implement more sophisticated or diverse active vision baselines (e.g., greedy visibility maximization, other MARL algorithms with simpler rewards) to rigorously demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.\\n5.  **Quantify Resource Efficiency:** Provide concrete metrics and results on camera usage, power consumption, or number of active cameras to fully support the \"resource-efficient\" claim.\\n6.  **Sim-to-Real Considerations:** Briefly discuss the challenges and potential strategies for deploying this system in a real-world setting, including noise, lighting variations, and calibration.\\n7.  **Computational Complexity:** Discuss the computational overhead of WDL inference and CTCR calculation, especially during deployment.\\n8.  **Qualitative Results:** Include more qualitative results, such as visualizations of camera movements over time, how cameras collaborate to track specific poses, or examples of successful turn-off decisions. This can greatly enhance understanding.\\n9.  **Discussion on Limitations:** Acknowledge current limitations candidly (e.g., synthetic data, specific action space) and outline clear future research directions (e.g., real-world deployment, handling dynamic environments, more complex human-object interactions).\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the paper can significantly enhance its clarity, rigor, and the perceived impact of its innovative MARL framework for proactive multi-camera collaboration.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9998.99910365}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'This paper proposes a compelling proactive multi-camera collaboration framework for 3D human pose estimation, leveraging an RL-based agent to control PTZ cameras. The use of a simulated environment (UNREALPOSE) for training and evaluation is a pragmatic choice. Here\\'s a detailed evaluation focusing on the requested aspects, with constructive feedback:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evaluation of \"Proactive Multi-Camera Collaboration for 3D Human Pose Estimation\"\\n\\n### 1. 3D Reconstruction Pipeline (Multi-View Triangulation)\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Standard Method:** Utilizing Direct Linear Transform (DLT) or a similar algebraic triangulation approach is a standard and well-understood method for multi-view 3D reconstruction.\\n*   **Confidence-Weighted Fusion:** The idea of weighting 2D joint detections by their confidence scores during triangulation (or in a subsequent fusion step) is crucial for robustness, as it allows the system to prioritize more reliable observations.\\n*   **Kinematic Prior for Missing Joints:** Interpolating missing joints using a kinematic model or prior knowledge is a good strategy to handle partial occlusions or poor 2D detections from some views.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement/Further Detail:**\\n*   **Robustness to Outliers:** While confidence weighting helps, real-world 2D HPE can produce significant outliers (e.g., misdetections, swapped joints). Does the triangulation pipeline incorporate a robust estimation method like RANSAC, or a more sophisticated outlier rejection mechanism? Without it, a single bad 2D detection from one camera could significantly degrade the 3D estimate for that joint. This is especially critical if 2D HPE performance varies.\\n*   **Handling Insufficient Views:** What happens if only one camera detects a joint, or if the triangulation geometry is poor (e.g., collinear cameras)? How does the system prioritize between triangulated estimates and kinematic interpolation in such cases? Is there a minimum number of views required for triangulation?\\n*   **Temporal Consistency:** While the RL agent\\'s reward function encourages smooth camera movements, how does the 3D reconstruction pipeline ensure temporal consistency of the 3D poses themselves, especially during camera movements or brief occlusions? Is there a temporal smoothing or filtering applied to the triangulated 3D poses?\\n*   **Detail on Triangulation Quality Metric:** The paper mentions that the reward function includes terms for good triangulation geometry (e.g., volume of the tetrahedron, inverse condition number). Providing more technical detail on *how* this is computed and *how* it directly influences the DLT process would be beneficial. Does it actively try to find optimal camera positions to minimize this condition number *during* triangulation, or just use it as a reward signal for the RL agent?\\n*   **Sensitivity to Calibration Errors:** Multi-view triangulation is highly sensitive to camera calibration accuracy. While UNREALPOSE provides perfect ground truth calibration, how would this system perform with real-world cameras and their inherent calibration inaccuracies? This is a significant sim-to-real challenge that warrants discussion.\\n\\n### 2. Effectiveness of the Perception Module\\n\\nThe perception module comprises 2D HPE, Re-ID, and multi-agent communication.\\n\\n**2.1. 2D Human Pose Estimation (HPE):**\\n*   **Strengths:** Using an off-the-shelf 2D HPE model (like AlphaPose) is practical and increases the realism of the simulation, as it mirrors a real-world deployment scenario where such models would be used.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The paper assumes the output of the 2D HPE is directly used. Real-world 2D HPE models can have varying accuracy, especially under occlusion, unusual poses, or motion blur. Was any noise (e.g., Gaussian noise proportional to confidence, or systematic errors) introduced to the 2D HPE outputs in UNREALPOSE to simulate these imperfections and test the robustness of the overall pipeline? This would significantly strengthen the claims of robustness.\\n\\n**2.2. Re-Identification (Re-ID):**\\n*   **Strengths:** Re-ID is crucial for multi-person tracking and consistent 3D reconstruction across views. The paper acknowledges this need.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** This is arguably the *weakest link* in the perception module as described. The paper states, \"we employ a simple linear assignment algorithm based on the distance between projected 3D centroids and 2D joint distances for re-identification.\"\\n    *   **Robustness:** A \"simple linear assignment\" is highly susceptible to id-switches, especially in crowded scenes, during occlusions, or when persons cross paths. In a proactive system, an id-switch can lead to severe pose estimation errors and disrupt the camera\\'s tracking strategy.\\n    *   **Memory/Tracking:** Does this simple assignment incorporate any temporal memory or tracklet management (e.g., Hungarian algorithm with appearance features, or DeepSORT)? Without it, the system might struggle with persistent tracking.\\n    *   **Dependence on 3D Centroids:** Relying on projected 3D centroids means the Re-ID itself depends on potentially noisy 3D estimates, creating a circular dependency.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Given the complexity of multi-person tracking, incorporating a more robust, deep learning-based Re-ID system or a more sophisticated multi-object tracking approach (e.g., with appearance embeddings, motion models, and tracklet management) would significantly enhance the system\\'s real-world applicability and reliability. This is a critical component for practical deployment.\\n\\n**2.3. Multi-Agent Communication:**\\n*   **Strengths:** The concept of cameras sharing 2D poses, IDs, and confidence scores is fundamental to multi-view collaboration. This is a key enabler for proactive behavior.\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Communication Model:** The paper implicitly assumes perfect, instantaneous communication without latency or bandwidth constraints within UNREALPOSE. In a real-world deployment, communication latency and bandwidth limitations can significantly impact the system\\'s responsiveness and ability to coordinate. Acknowledging these real-world constraints and discussing how the system might handle them (e.g., by predicting future states, operating on stale information, or prioritizing critical data) would add significant depth.\\n    *   **Decentralization vs. Centralization:** While referred to as \"multi-agent,\" is the RL agent truly decentralized (each camera deciding independently with shared info) or is there a centralized \"brain\" deciding actions for all cameras based on the aggregated state? Clarifying the architecture of the decision-making process is important. If truly decentralized, how are conflicting desired actions resolved?\\n    *   **Communication Strategy Ablation:** Could the communication be more intelligent? For instance, only sharing information about newly detected persons, or only sharing high-confidence detections, or only sharing when ambiguity is high. An ablation study on different communication strategies (e.g., no communication, full communication, bandwidth-limited communication) could highlight the value and sensitivity of this component.\\n\\n### 3. Realism and Validity of UNREALPOSE Environment\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Controlled Environment:** Provides precise ground truth for 3D poses, camera parameters, and occlusions, which is invaluable for training and evaluating an RL agent.\\n*   **Diversity of Scenarios:** The ability to simulate various indoor and outdoor scenes, different numbers of people, and diverse activities increases the generalizability of the learned policy within the simulated domain.\\n*   **Realistic Visuals:** Leveraging Unreal Engine helps create visually plausible environments and character models.\\n*   **Customizable:** The environment\\'s customizability allows for systematic experimentation with different camera layouts, human behaviors, and occlusion patterns.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement/Discussion:**\\n*   **Sim-to-Real Gap:** This is the most significant challenge for any system trained purely in simulation.\\n    *   **Visual Realism vs. Photorealism:** While visually realistic, subtle differences in lighting, textures, material properties, and human appearance (e.g., clothing folds, hair) compared to real-world data can create a domain gap for the 2D HPE models, even if they are pre-trained on real data.\\n    *   **Sensor Noise:** Does UNREALPOSE simulate real-world camera sensor noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, shot noise, motion blur)? These factors degrade the quality of 2D detections and are critical for evaluating the robustness of the entire pipeline.\\n    *   **Camera Calibration Errors:** As mentioned, real cameras have calibration errors. Simulating these errors (e.g., small perturbations to extrinsic/intrinsic parameters) would better prepare the system for deployment.\\n    *   **Physics and Dynamics:** While character animations are used, the physical interactions (e.g., minor occlusions by objects, ground contact) and natural variations in human movement might not be perfectly captured, which could impact the RL agent\\'s learning of optimal tracking strategies.\\n*   **Discussion on Bridging the Gap:** The paper would benefit from a dedicated section discussing the inherent sim-to-real challenges and outlining a clear roadmap for real-world deployment, including strategies like domain randomization, adaptation (e.g., sim-to-real transfer learning), or even a small-scale real-world pilot study to validate initial findings. Without real-world validation, the claim of being \"ready for real-world deployment\" remains speculative.\\n\\n### 4. Experimental Results\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n*   **Clear Baselines:** Comparison against passive fixed-camera baselines and random control is effective in demonstrating the superiority of the proactive approach. This clearly quantifies the benefit of active perception.\\n*   **Standard Metrics:** Using MPJPE, joint visibility, and triangulation quality are appropriate and standard metrics for 3D HPE evaluation, allowing for clear quantitative assessment.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies on different components of the reward function are valuable. They demonstrate the individual contribution of maximizing visibility, improving triangulation geometry, and ensuring smooth camera movements.\\n*   **Generalization within Sim:** The experiments showing generalization to varying numbers of people, activities, and camera counts within the UNREALPOSE environment are positive indicators of the learned policy\\'s robustness within the simulated domain.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n*   **Robustness to Perception Noise:** As highlighted earlier, injecting realistic noise into the 2D HPE outputs (or even simulating imperfect Re-ID) would provide a more realistic assessment of the *overall system\\'s* robustness, rather than just the RL policy\\'s effectiveness under ideal perception.\\n*   **Real-World Generalization (Crucial Missing Piece):** The most significant limitation of the experimental results is the complete absence of real-world validation. While UNREALPOSE is excellent for training, the performance gains observed in simulation do not guarantee similar performance in the messy, unpredictable real world. This is paramount for a \"proactive\" system.\\n    *   **Recommendation:** Even a small-scale pilot study using a few real PTZ cameras and a simple setup would significantly enhance the paper\\'s impact and credibility. If not possible, a detailed discussion on the real-world deployment challenges and a concrete plan for future work on this front are essential.\\n*   **Computational Cost:** Discussing the computational cost of the RL inference for camera control and the entire perception pipeline in real-time scenarios would be valuable, especially if considering deployment on edge devices or with limited compute resources.\\n*   **Failure Modes:** What are the typical failure modes of the proactive system? (e.g., losing track of an individual, getting \"stuck\" in a suboptimal configuration, erratic camera movements under high ambiguity). Analyzing these failure modes would provide deeper insights and inform future improvements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Overall Constructive Feedback:\\n\\nThe paper presents a very interesting and novel approach to proactive multi-camera collaboration for 3D human pose estimation.

Leveraging Unreal Engine provides a strong foundation for visual realism and physics. The integration with OpenAI Gym is commendable, making it accessible for RL research. The paper demonstrates its utility effectively for the multi-camera collaboration task.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**1. Design and Implementation of UNREALPOSE:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Unreal Engine Foundation:** The choice of Unreal Engine is excellent. It provides high-fidelity rendering, a robust physics engine, a vast asset library, and sophisticated lighting capabilities, crucial for generating photorealistic synthetic data.\\n    *   **Synthetic Data Generation:** The ability to generate ground truth 3D pose, camera parameters, and semantic segmentation is invaluable, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection for 3D HPE.\\n    *   **Modularity:** The environment appears modular, allowing for different human models, actions, backgrounds, and camera configurations. This is key for research flexibility.\\n    *   **Customizable Camera Systems:** The focus on dynamic camera control (pan, tilt, zoom) is directly aligned with the paper\\'s goal and is well-implemented.\\n    *   **Integration with Robotics Frameworks:** While not explicitly detailed, the mention of communication via Python sockets suggests potential for integration with ROS or other robotics middleware, enhancing its utility beyond pure RL.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement/Further Detail:**\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Running Unreal Engine with high fidelity for RL training can be computationally expensive. It would be beneficial to discuss optimization strategies, such as running multiple instances in headless mode or profiling typical `step` and `reset` times.\\n    *   **Asset Pipeline:** While Unreal has a vast library, the paper could elaborate on the process of importing and integrating specific human models, MoCap data, and scene assets. Is there a streamlined pipeline or does it require significant manual setup for new assets?\\n    *   **Physics Engine Customization:** Beyond MoCap, does the environment allow for custom physics-based interactions or ragdoll simulations, which might be useful for more complex human-environment interactions?\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. Realism:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Visual Realism:** The use of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials, dynamic lighting, and detailed 3D models significantly enhances visual realism, reducing the sim-to-real gap. This is crucial for training models that generalize to real images.\\n    *   **Occlusion Modeling:** The environment inherently handles complex occlusions due to objects and self-occlusions, a critical aspect of multi-view pose estimation.\\n    *   **Camera Parameters:** Realistic camera FOV, resolution, and possibly depth-of-field modeling contribute to the fidelity of generated images.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Sensor Noise:** While visually impressive, real-world cameras suffer from various types of noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, shot noise, low-light noise, motion blur, lens distortion, chromatic aberration). Adding configurable noise models could further enhance realism and robustness of trained policies.\\n    *   **Background Dynamism:** The current backgrounds appear static. Incorporating dynamic elements in the environment (e.g., other non-human moving objects, changing lighting conditions over time) could make the simulation more challenging and realistic.\\n    *   **Material Properties:** More advanced material properties (e.g., reflective surfaces, semi-transparent materials) that cause complex light interactions could test the robustness of pose estimators further.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3. Flexibility:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Diverse Human Models:** The ability to swap human models (gender, clothing, potentially body shape) is excellent for ensuring generalization.\\n    *   **MoCap Integration:** Leveraging professional MoCap data provides a wide range of realistic human movements and activities.\\n    *   **Configurable Scenes:** The option to change background scenes (indoor/outdoor) and potentially add/remove static objects significantly increases the diversity of training scenarios.\\n    *   **Camera System Customization:** The environment supports varying numbers of cameras and their initial placements, offering high flexibility for testing different multi-camera setups.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Procedural Scene Generation:** While diverse backgrounds are good, the ability to procedurally generate new scene layouts, furniture arrangements, or object distributions would further enhance variability and reduce manual setup.\\n    *   **Parameterized Human Models:** Beyond selecting models, allowing for procedural variations in body dimensions (height, limb lengths, weight) could improve generalization to a wider human population.\\n    *   **Complex Scenarios:** Flexibility could be extended to multi-human scenarios with interactions, or human-object interactions (e.g., sitting on a chair, opening a door).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. RL-Readiness:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **OpenAI Gym API Integration:** This is a major strength. Adhering to the standard API makes the environment immediately compatible with a vast ecosystem of RL algorithms and frameworks.\\n    *   **Clear Observation/Action Spaces:** The definition of observation (multi-view images, ground truth pose for reward) and action (camera pan/tilt/zoom) is well-defined and suitable for RL.\\n    *   **Reward Function:** The pose error-based reward function is intuitive and directly aligns with the objective of 3D HPE. Adding components for camera movement cost or coverage can lead to more efficient and optimal policies.\\n    *   **Episodic Structure:** The concept of episodes with `reset` functionality is fundamental for RL training.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Parallelization:** For large-scale RL training, the ability to run multiple environment instances in parallel is crucial. It would be valuable to detail how UNREALPOSE supports this (e.g., via multiprocessing, a client-server architecture).\\n    *   **Observation Space Design:** While providing raw images is good, for more complex scenarios, explore higher-level observations for the RL agent (e.g., keypoint detections, estimated 2D pose, bounding boxes, or even learned features from a pre-trained backbone) to potentially simplify the learning task for the agent.\\n    *   **Reward Shaping:** While the current reward is effective, more sophisticated reward shaping (e.g., penalizing unnecessary camera movement, rewarding coverage of specific body parts, or smoothness of camera movement) could lead to faster convergence and more natural camera behaviors.\\n    *   **Simulator Reset Time:** The time it takes to `reset` the environment can significantly impact training speed. It would be useful to report this and discuss any optimizations made.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**5. Validity of Simulated Human Behaviors:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **MoCap-Driven:** Using professional motion capture data (e.g., CMU MoCap) ensures that the human movements are highly realistic and natural, avoiding synthetic, unnatural motions often seen in rule-based animations.\\n    *   **Diverse Activities:** Leveraging various MoCap sequences allows for a range of human activities (walking, running, specific actions), which is important for robust pose estimation.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Beyond MoCap:** While MoCap is excellent, it\\'s pre-recorded. Future work could explore incorporating physics-based character controllers or reinforcement learning for humanoids to generate novel, interactive behaviors within the environment.\\n    *   **Social Interactions:** For multi-human scenarios, the validity could be enhanced by simulating realistic social interactions between agents.\\n    *   **Human-Environment Interaction:** Current MoCap often focuses on movements in open space. Adding realistic interactions with scene objects (e.g., sitting on a chair, opening a door, climbing stairs) would significantly increase behavioral validity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**6. Validity of Camera Dynamics:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Explicit Action Space:** The clear definition of pan, tilt, and zoom actions directly maps to real PTZ camera controls, allowing for realistic dynamic camera behaviors.\\n    *   **Realistic Constraints:** The environment likely incorporates realistic limits on pan/tilt range, zoom levels, and movement speeds, making the learned policies more applicable to real hardware.\\n    *   **Smooth Transitions:** Unreal Engine\\'s animation capabilities likely ensure smooth camera movements, which is important for consistent image streams.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Real-World Camera Latency:** In real multi-camera systems, there\\'s network latency and processing delay. Simulating these delays could make the RL problem more realistic and challenging.\\n    *   **Mechanical Noise:** Real PTZ cameras have mechanical noise (e.g., motor hum, slight vibrations). While subtle, incorporating such aspects could contribute to the ultimate realism.\\n    *   **Non-Ideal Camera Mounts:** Simulating slight camera shakes or less than perfectly rigid mounts could also add realism.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**7. Configuration Options:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   The paper implies extensive configurability (number of cameras, initial positions, human models, MoCap, backgrounds). This flexibility is paramount for systematic research.\\n    *   It\\'s likely implemented via config files (e.g., JSON, YAML) or Python API calls, which are standard and user-friendly.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Documentation:** Providing clear and comprehensive documentation on all available configuration options and their effects would be highly beneficial for future users.\\n    *   **Version Control for Configurations:** Encouraging or facilitating version control of environment configurations would ensure reproducibility of experiments.\\n    *   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** For initial setup or debugging, a simple GUI within the Unreal Editor to set up scenarios could streamline workflow for non-programmers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**8. OpenAI Gym API Integration:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Standard Compliance:** Adherence to the Gym API is excellent, making the environment immediately accessible to the broader RL community and allowing for easy swapping of RL algorithms.\\n    *   **Clarity:** The Gym interface forces clear definitions of observation space, action space, reward, done signal, and info dictionary, promoting good design practices.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Performance Benchmarking:** Provide benchmarks for `env.step()` and `env.reset()` call times, especially under different rendering settings or hardware configurations. This helps users estimate training times.\\n    *   **Custom Info:** Beyond the standard Gym API, consider what additional diagnostic or ground truth information could be passed in the `info` dictionary during `step()` (e.g., precise 3D camera poses, full MoCap data of the frame, detailed occlusion masks) for debugging or advanced analysis.\\n    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** For very heavy environments, exploring asynchronous `step` or `reset` operations could be beneficial.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**9. Generalization to Various Scenarios:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Experimental Validation:** The paper explicitly tests generalization by training on a subset of MoCap activities/backgrounds and evaluating on unseen ones. The positive results (e.g., \"The proposed method maintains the lowest 3DPCK across all MoCap activities\") are a strong validation of UNREALPOSE\\'s utility.\\n    *   **Domain Randomization Potential:** The flexibility of UNREALPOSE makes it an ideal platform for applying domain randomization during RL training, which is crucial for reducing the sim-to-real gap.\\n\\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Sim-to-Real Gap Analysis:** While generalization within the simulation is good, the ultimate test is generalization to real-world camera systems and human movements. A dedicated section discussing strategies to bridge this gap (e.g., advanced domain randomization, photorealistic rendering techniques, reality gap evaluation) would be valuable.\\n    *   **Adversarial Scenarios:** Test generalization to deliberately challenging or \"adversarial\" scenarios, such as very crowded scenes, highly occluded movements, or extreme lighting conditions, to identify robustness limits.\\n    *   **Systematic Variation:** While tested, more granular control and reporting on how specific variations (e.g., specific human models, particular lighting configurations, object clutter levels) affect generalization could offer deeper insights.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion and Overall Recommendation:**\\n\\nUNREALPOSE is a meticulously designed and implemented environment that effectively supports the proactive multi-camera collaboration task. Its foundation in Unreal Engine, coupled with strong RL-readiness through the OpenAI Gym API, positions it as a valuable tool for research in computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning.\\n\\nTo further enhance the paper and the environment, I recommend:\\n\\n1.  **Detailed Performance Analysis:** Provide specifics on computational demands, `step`/`reset` times, and parallelization capabilities.\\n2.  **Expanded Realism Features:** Integrate and evaluate sensor noise models and more dynamic background elements.\\n3.  **Advanced Flexibility:** Discuss or implement procedural scene generation and more complex human-environment interactions.\\n4.  **Sim-to-Real Strategies:** A dedicated discussion on how UNREALPOSE will be used to bridge the sim-to-real gap, perhaps through advanced domain randomization, would strengthen the paper\\'s impact.\\n5.  **Documentation Focus:** Emphasize the importance and provide examples of comprehensive documentation for configuration and API usage for reproducibility and community adoption.\\n\\nOverall, the UNREALPOSE environment is a very strong contribution, demonstrating both technical prowess and practical utility for a challenging problem.
