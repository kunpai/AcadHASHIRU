The paper title is: Communication-Efficient and Drift-Robust Federated Learning via Elastic Net\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative method that allows many clients to contribute individually to training a global model by sharing local models rather than private data. Each client has a local training dataset, which it does not want to share with the global server. Instead, each client computes an update to the current global model maintained by the server, and only this update is communicated. FL significantly reduces the risks of privacy and security (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a), but it faces crucial challenges that make the federated settings distinct from other classical problems (Li et al., 2020a) such as expensive communication costs and client drift problems due to heterogeneous local training datasets and heterogeneous systems (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016a;b). Communicating models is a critical bottleneck in FL, in particular when the federated network comprises a massive number of devices (Bonawitz et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020a; Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016b). In such a scenario, communication in the federated network may take a longer time than that of local computation by many orders of magnitude because of limited communication bandwidth and device power (Li et al., 2020a). To reduce such communication cost, several strategies have been proposed (Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016b; Li et al., 2020a). In particular, Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al. (2016b) proposed several methods to form structured local updates and approximate them, e.g., subsampling and quantization. Reisizadeh et al. (2020); Xu et al. (2020) also proposed an efficient quantization method for FL to reduce the communication cost. Also, in general, as the datasets that local clients own are heterogeneous, trained models on each local data are inconsistent with the global model that minimizes the global empirical loss (Karimireddy et al., 2020; Malinovskiy et al., 2020; Acar et al., 2021). This issue is referred to as the client drift problem. In order to resolve the client drift problem, FedProx (Li et al., 2020b) added a proximal term to a local objective function and regulated local model updates. Karimireddy et al. (2020) proposed SCAFFOLD algorithm that transfers both model updates and control variates to resolve the client drift problem. FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) dynamically regularizes local objective functions to resolve the client drift problem. Unlike most prior works focusing on either the communication cost problem or the client drift problem, we propose a technique that effectively resolves the communication cost and client drift problems simultaneously. Contributions In this paper, we propose FedElasticNet, a new framework for communicationefficient and drift-robust FL. It repurposes the \u21131-norm and \u21132-norm regularizers of the elastic net (Zou & Hastie, 2005), by which it successfully improves (i) communication efficiency by adopting the \u21131-norm regularizer and (ii) robustness to heterogeneous local datasets by adopting the \u21132-norm regularizer. FedElasticNet is a general framework; hence, it can be integrated with prior FL algorithms such as FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017), FedProx (Li et al., 2020b), SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020), and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) so as to resolve the client drift problem as well as the communication cost problem. Further, it incurs no additional costs in training. Empirically, we show that FedElasticNet enhances communication efficiency while maintaining the classification accuracy even for heterogeneous datasets, i.e., the client drift problem is resolved. Theoretically, we characterize the impact of the regularizer terms. Table 1 compares the prior methods and the proposed FedElasticNet if integrated with FedDyn (Algorithm 3). 2 RELATED WORK: To address the communication cost and client drift problems, numerous approaches were proposed. Here, we describe closely related works that we consider baseline methods. The comprehensive reviews can be found in Kairouz et al. (2021); Li et al. (2020a). FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) is one of the most commonly used methods. FedAvg tackles the communication bottleneck issue by performing multiple local updates before communicating to the server. It works well for homogeneous datasets across clients (McMahan et al., 2017; Karimireddy et al., 2020), but it is known that FedAvg may diverge when local datasets are heterogeneous (Zhao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a). FedProx (Li et al., 2020b) addressed the data heterogeneity problem. FedProx introduces an \u21132-norm regularizer to the local objective functions to penalize local updates that are far from the server\u2019s model and thus to limit the impact of variable local updates (Li et al., 2020b). Although FedProx is more robust to heterogeneous datasets than FedAvg, the regularizer does not result in aligning the global and local stationary points (Acar et al., 2021). Also, we note that FedProx does not improve communication efficiency compared to that of FedAvg. SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020) defined client drift that the model created by aggregating local models and the optimal global model is inconsistent because of heterogeneous local datasets. SCAFFOLD communicates the trained local models and the clients\u2019 control variates so as to resolve the client drift problem. Hence, SCAFFOLD requires twice the communication cost compared to other FL algorithms. FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) dynamically updates its local regularizers at each round to ensure that the local clients\u2019 optima are asymptotically consistent with stationary points of the global empirical loss. Unlike SCAFFOLD, FedDyn resolves the client drift problem without incurring additional communication costs. However, FedDyn\u2019s communication cost is not improved compared to FedAvg and FedProx. Zou & Hastie (2005) proposed the elastic net to encourage the grouping effect, in other words, to encourage strongly correlated covariates to be in or out of the model description together (Hu et al., 2018). Initially, the elastic net was proposed to overcome the limitations of Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) imposing an \u21131-norm penalty on the model parameters. For instance of a linear least square problem, the objective of Lasso is to solve min \u03b8 \u2225y \u2212X\u03b8\u222522 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u03b8\u22251 , (1) where y is the outcome and X is the covariate matrix. Lasso performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting model. However, it has some limitations, especially for high-dimensional models. If a group of variables is highly correlated, then Lasso tends to select only one variable from the group and does not care which one is selected (Zou & Hastie, 2005). The elastic net overcomes these limitations by adding an \u21132-norm penalty. The objective of the elastic net is to solve min \u03b8 \u2225y \u2212 X\u03b8\u222522 + \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u03b8\u222522 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u03b8\u22251 . (2) The elastic net simultaneously enables automatic variable selection and continuous shrinkage by the \u21131-norm regularizer and enables to select groups of correlated variables by its \u21132-norm regularizer (Zou & Hastie, 2005). We will leverage the elastic net approach to resolve the critical problems of FL: expensive communication cost and client drift problems. 3 PROPOSED METHOD: FEDELASTICNET: We assume that m local clients communicate with the global server. For the kth client (where k \u2208 [m]) participating in each training round, we assume that a training data feature x \u2208 X and its corresponding label y \u2208 Y are drawn IID from a device-indexed joint distribution, i.e., (x, y) \u223c Pk (Acar et al., 2021). The objective is to find argmin \u03b8\u2208Rd R (\u03b8) := 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] Lk (\u03b8)  , (3) where Lk (\u03b8) = Ex\u223cPk [lk (\u03b8; (x, y))] is the local risk of the kth clients over possibly heterogeneous data distributions Pk. Also, \u03b8 represents the model parameters and lk(\u00b7) is a loss function such as cross entropy (Acar et al., 2021). FedElasticNet The proposed method (FedElasticNet) leverages the elastic net approach to resolve the communication cost and client drift problems. We introduce the \u21131-norm and \u21132-norm penalties on the local updates: In each round t \u2208 [T ], the kth local client attempts to find \u03b8tk by solving the following optimization problem: \u03b8tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8) + \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u2225 1 , (4) where \u03b8t\u22121 denotes the global model received from the server. Then, it transmits the difference \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 to the server. Inspired by the elastic net, we introduce two types of regularizers for local objective functions; however, each of them works in a different way so as to resolve each of the two FL problems: the communication cost and client drift problems. First, the \u21132-norm regularizer resolves the client drift problem by limiting the impact of variable local updates as in FedProx (Li et al., 2020b). FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) also adopts the \u21132-norm regularizer to control the client drift. Second, the \u21131-norm regularizer attempts to sparsify the local updates \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121. We consider two ways of measuring communication cost: One is the number of nonzero elements in \u2206tk (Yoon et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2021), which the \u21131-norm sparsifies. The other is the (Shannon) entropy since it is the theoretical lower bound on the data compression (Cover & Thomas, 2006). We demonstrate that the \u21131-norm penalty on the local updates can effectively reduce the number of nonzero elements as well as the entropy in Section 4. To boost sparseness of \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121, we sent \u2206tk(i) = 0 if |\u2206tk(i)| \u2264 \u03f5 where \u2206tk(i) denotes the ith element of \u2206tk. The parameter \u03f5 is chosen in a range that does not affect classification accuracy. Our FedElasticNet approach can be integrated into existing FL algorithms such as FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017), SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020), and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) without additional costs, which will be described in the following subsections.

As shown in Algorithm 1, the local client minimizes the local objective function (4). In Step 7, n and nk denote the total numbers of data points of all clients and the data points of the kth client, respectively. It is worth mentioning that FedProx uses the \u21132-norm regularizer to address the data and system heterogeneities (Li et al., 2020b). By adding the \u21131-norm regularizer, we can sparsify the local updates of FedProx and thus effectively reduce the communication cost. Notice that Algorithm 1 can be viewed as the integration of FedProx and FedElasticNet. 3.2 FEDELASTICNET FOR SCAFFOLD (SCAFFOLD + ELASTIC NET): In SCAFFOLD, each client computes the following mini-batch gradient\u2207Lk(\u03b8tk) and control variate ctk (Karimireddy et al., 2020): \u03b8tk \u2190 \u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b7l ( \u2207Lk ( \u03b8tk ) \u2212 ct\u22121k + c t\u22121) , (5) ctk \u2190 ct\u22121k \u2212 c t\u22121 + 1 B\u03b7l (\u03b8t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8tk), (6) where \u03b7l is the local step size and B is the number of mini-batches at each round. This control variate makes the local parameters \u03b8tk updated in the direction of the global optimum rather than each local optimum, which effectively resolves the client drift problem. However, SCAFFOLD incurs twice much communication cost since it should communicate the local update \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 and the control variate \u2206ck = ctk \u2212 c t\u22121 k , which are of the same dimension. In order to reduce the communication cost of SCAFFOLD, we apply our FedElasticNet framework. In the proposed algorithm (see Algorithm 2), each local client computes the following mini-batch gradient instead of (5): \u03b8tk \u2190 \u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b7l ( \u2207Lk ( \u03b8tk ) \u2212 ct\u22121k + c t\u22121 + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) + \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) ) , (7) where \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) corresponds to the gradient of \u21131-norm regularizer \u03bb1\u2225\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u22251. This \u21131-norm regularizer sparsifies the local update \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121; hence, reduces the communication cost. Since the control variate already addresses the client drift problem, we can remove the \u21132-norm regularizer or set \u03bb2 as a small value. 3.3 FEDELASTICNET FOR FEDDYN (FEDDYN + ELASTIC NET): In FedDyn, each local client optimizes the following local objective, which is the sum of its empirical loss and a penalized risk function: \u03b8tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8)\u2212 \u27e8\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ), \u03b8\u27e9+ \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 , (8) where the penalized risk is dynamically updated so as to satisfy the following first-order condition for local optima: \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ) + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = 0. (9) This first-order condition shows that the stationary points of the local objective function are consistent with the server model (Acar et al., 2021). That is, the client drift is resolved. However, FedDyn makes no difference from FedAvg and FedProx in communication costs. By integrating FedElasticNet and FedDyn, we can effectively reduce the communication cost of FedDyn as well. In the proposed method (i.e., FedElasticNet for FedDyn), each local client optimizes the following local empirical objective: \u03b8tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8)\u2212 \u27e8\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ), \u03b8\u27e9+ \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u2225 1 , (10) which is the sum of (8) and the additional \u21131-norm penalty on the local updates. The corresponding first-order condition is given by \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ) + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) + \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = 0. (11) Notice that the stationary points of the local objective function are consistent with the server model as in (9). If \u03b8tk \u0338= \u03b8t\u22121 (i.e., sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = \u00b11), then the first-order condition is \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ) + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = \u00b1\u03bb1, (12) where \u03bb1 is a vectorized one. Our empirical results show that the optimized hyperparameter is \u03bb1 = 10 \u22124 or 10\u22126 and the impact of \u00b1\u03bb1 in (12) would be negligible. Hence, the proposed FedElasticNet for FedDyn resolves the client drift problem. Further, the local update \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 is sparse due to the \u21131-norm regularizer, which effectively reduces the communication cost at the same time. The detailed algorithm is described in Algorithm 3.

Theorem 3.1 provides a convergence rate of FedElasticNet for FedDyn. If T \u2192\u221e, the first term of (13) converges to 0 at the speed of O(1/T ). The second and the third terms of (13) are additional penalty terms caused by the \u21131-norm regularizer. The second term is a negligible constant in the range of hyperparameters of our interest. Considering the last term, notice that the summand at each t includes the expected average of sign vectors where each element is \u00b11. If a coordinate of the sign vectors across clients is viewed as an IID realization of Bern( 12 ), it can be thought of as a small value with high probability by the concentration property (see Appendix B.3). In addition, \u03b3t\u22121\u2212 \u03b8\u2217 characterizes how much the average of local models deviates from the globally optimal model, which tends to be small as training proceeds. Therefore, the effect of both additional terms is negligible. 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we evaluate the proposed FedElasticNet on benchmark datasets for various FL scenarios. In particular, FedElasticNet is integrated with prior methods including FedProx (Li et al., 2020b), SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020), and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021). The experimental results show that FedElasticNet effectively enhances communication efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy and resolving the client drift problem. We observe that the integration of FedElasticNet and FedDyn (Algorithm 3) achieves the best performance. Experimental Setup We use the same benchmark datasets as prior works. The evaluated datasets include MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), a subset of EMNIST (Cohen et al., 2017, EMNIST-L), CIFAR10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), and Shakespeare (Shakespeare, 1914). The IID split is generated by randomly assigning datapoint to the local clients. The Dirichlet distribution is used on the label ratios to ensure uneven label distributions among local clients for non-IID splits as in Zhao et al. (2018); Acar et al. (2021). For the uneven label distributions among 100 experimental devices, the experiments are performed by using the Dirichlet parameters of 0.3 and 0.6, and the number of data points is obtained by the lognormal distribution as in Acar et al. (2021). The data imbalance is controlled by varying the variance of the lognormal distribution (Acar et al., 2021). We use the same neural network models of FedDyn experiments (Acar et al., 2021). For MNIST and EMNIST-L, fully connected neural network architectures with 2 hidden layers are used. The numbers of neurons in the layers are 200 and 100, respectively (Acar et al., 2021). Remark that the model used for MNIST dataset is the same as in Acar et al. (2021); McMahan et al. (2017). For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we use a CNN model consisting of 2 convolutional layers with 64 5\u00d7 5 filters followed by 2 fully connected layers with 394 and 192 neurons and a softmax layer. For the next character prediction task for Shakespeare, we use a stacked LSTM as in Acar et al. (2021). For MNIST, EMNIST-L, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, we evaluate three cases: IID, non-IID with Dirichlet (.6), and non-IID with Dirichlet (.3). Shakespeare datasets are evaluated for IID and non-IID cases as in Acar et al. (2021). We use the batch size of 10 for the MNIST dataset, 50 for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and EMNIST-L datasets, and 20 for the Shakespeare dataset. We optimize the hyperparameters depending on the evaluated datasets: learning rates, \u03bb2, and \u03bb1. Evaluation of Methods We compare the baseline methods (FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and FedDyn) and the proposed FedElasticNet integrations (Algorithms 1, 2, and 3), respectively. We evaluate the communication cost and classification accuracy for non-IID settings of the prior methods and the proposed methods. The robustness of the client drift problem is measured by the classification accuracy of non-IID settings. We report the communication costs in two ways: (i) the number of nonzero elements in transmitted values as in (Yoon et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2021) and (ii) the Shannon entropy of transmitted bits. Note that the Shannon entropy is the theoretical limit of data compression (Cover & Thomas, 2006), which can be achieved by practical algorithms; for instance, Han et al. (2016) used Huffman coding for model compression. We calculate the entropy of discretized values with the bin size of 0.01. Note that the transmitted values are not discretized in FL, and only the discretization is considered to calculate the entropy. The lossy compression schemes (e.g., scalar quantization, vector quantization, etc.) have not been considered since they include several implementational issues which are beyond our research scope. Table 2 reports the number of non-zero elements of the baseline methods with/without FedElasticNet. Basically, the communication costs per round of FedProx and FedDyn are the same; SCAFFOLD suffers from the doubled communication cost because of the control variates. The proposed FedElasticNet integrations (Algorithms 1, 2, and 3) can effectively sparsify the transmitted local updates, which enhances communication efficiency. In particular, the minimal communication cost is achieved when FedElasticNet is integrated with FedDyn (Algorithm 3). It is because the classification accuracy is not degraded even if the transmitted values are more aggressively sparsified in Algorithm 3. Fig. 2 shows the transmitted local updates \u2206tk of Algorithm 3 are sparser than FedDyn and Algorithm 2. Hence, Algorithm 3 (FedElasticNet for FedDyn) achieves the best communication efficiency. Tables 3 and 4 report the Shannon entropy of transmitted bits for the baseline methods with/without FedElasticNet. The communication costs of baseline methods are effectively improved by the FedElasticNet approach. Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 reduce the entropy compared to the their baseline methods. We note that FedElasticNet integrated with FedDyn (Algorithm 3) achieves the minimum entropy, i.e., the minimum communication cost. For FedDyn, we evaluate the Shannon entropy values for two cases: (i) transmit the updated local models \u03b8tk as in Acar et al. (2021) and (ii) transmit the local updates \u2206 t k = \u03b8 t k\u2212\u03b8t\u22121 as in Algorithm 3. We observe that transmitting the local updates \u2206tk instead of the local models \u03b8 t k can reduce the Shannon entropy significantly. Hence, it is beneficial to transmit the local updates \u2206tk even for FedDyn if it adopts an additional compression scheme. The numbers of nonzero elements for two cases (i.e., \u03b8tk and \u2206 t k) are the same for FedDyn. Fig. 1 shows that the FedElasticNet maintains the classification accuracy or incurs marginal degradation. We observe a classification gap between FedProx and Algorithm 1 for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. However, the classification accuracies of FedDyn and Algorithm 3 are almost identical in the converged regime. In particular, Algorithm 3 significantly reduces the Shannon entropy, which can be explained by Fig 2. Fig 2 compares the distributions of the transmitted local updates \u2206tk for FedDyn, Algorithm 2, and Algorithm 3. Because of the \u21131-norm penalty on the local updates, Algorithm 3 makes sparser local updates than FedDyn. The local updates of FedDyn can be modeled by the Gaussian distribution, and the local updates of FedElasticNet can be modeled by the non-Gaussian distribution (similar to the Laplacian distribution). It is well-known that the Gaussian distribution maximizes the entropy for a given variance in information theory Cover & Thomas (2006). Hence, FedElasticNet can reduce the entropy by transforming the Gaussian distribution into the non-Gaussian one. 5 CONCLUSION: We proposed FedElasticNet, a general framework to improve communication efficiency and resolve the client drift problem simultaneously. We introduce two types of penalty terms on the local model updates by repurposing the classical elastic net. The \u21131-norm regularizer sparsifies the local model updates, which reduces the communication cost. The \u21132-norm regularizer limits the impact of variable local updates to resolve the client drift problem. Importantly, our framework can be integrated with prior FL techniques so as to simultaneously resolve the communication cost problem and the client drift problem. By integrating FedElasticNet with FedDyn, we can achieve the best communication efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy for heterogeneous datasets. A APPENDIX:  A.1 EXPERIMENT DETAILS: We provide the details of our experiments. We select the datasets for our experiments, including those used in prior work on federated learning (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020b; Acar et al., 2021). To fairly compare the non-IID environments, the datasets and the experimental environments are the same as those of Acar et al. (2021). Hyperparameters. We describe the hyperparameters used in our experiments in Section 4. We perform a grid search to find the best \u03bb1 and \u03f5 used in the proposed algorithms. Each hyperparameter was selected to double the value as the performance improved. We use the same \u03bb2 as in Acar et al. (2021). SCAFFOLD has the same local epoch and batch size as other algorithms, and SCAFFOLD is not included in Table 4 because other hyperparameters are not required. Table 5 shows the hyperparameters used in our experiments. A.2 REGULARIZER COEFFICIENTS: We selected \u03bb1 over {10\u22122, 10\u22124, 10\u22126, 10\u22128} to observe the impact of \u03bb1 on the classification accuracy. We prefer a larger \u03bb1 to enhance communication efficiency unless the \u21131-norm regularizer does not degrade the classification accuracy. Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the classification accuracy depending on \u03bb1 in the CIFAR-10 dataset with 10% participation rate and Dirichlet (.3). The unit of the cumulative number of elements is 107. In Algorithm 1, we selected \u03bb1 = 10\u22126 to avoid a degradation of classification accuracy (see Fig. 3) and maximize the sparsity of local updates. In this way, we selected the coefficient values \u03bb1 (See Fig.4 for Algorithm 2 and 5 and Algorithm 3). A.3 EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY:  B PROOF: We utilize some techniques in FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021). B.1 DEFINITION: We introduce a formal definition and properties that we will use. Definition B.0.1. A function Lk is \u03b2-smooth if it satisfies \u2225\u2207Lk(x)\u2212\u2207Lk(y)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b2\u2225x\u2212 y\u2225 \u2200x, y. (14) If function Lk is convex and \u03b2-smooth, it satisfies \u2212 \u27e8\u2207Lk(x), z \u2212 y\u27e9 \u2264 \u2212Lk(z) + Lk(y) + \u03b2 2 \u2225z \u2212 x\u22252 \u2200x, y, z. (15) As a consequence of the convexity and smoothness, the following property holds (Nesterov, 2018, Theorem 2.1.5): 1 2\u03b2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2225\u2207Lk(x)\u2212\u2207Lk(x\u2217)\u22252 \u2264 R(x)\u2212R(x\u2217) \u2200x (16) whereR(x) = 1m \u2211m k=1 Lk(x) and \u2207R(x\u2217) = 0. We will also use the relaxed triangle inequality (Karimireddy et al., 2020, Lemma 3):\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 n\u2211 j=1 vj \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 n n\u2211 j=1 \u2225vj\u22252. (17) B.2 PROOF OF THEOREM 3.1: The theorem that we will prove is as follows. Theorem B.1 (Full statement of Theorem 3.1). Assume that the clients are uniformly randomly selected at each round and the individual loss functions {Lk}mk=1 are convex and \u03b2-smooth. Also assume that \u03bb2 > 27\u03b2. Then Algorithm 3 satisfies the following inequality: Letting R(\u03b8) = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] Lk(\u03b8) and \u03b8\u2217 = argmin \u03b8 R(\u03b8), E [ R ( 1 T T\u22121\u2211 t=0 \u03b3t ) \u2212R(\u03b8\u2217) ] \u2264 1 T 1 \u03ba0 (E\u2225\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u22252 + \u03baC0) + \u03ba\u2032 \u03ba0 \u00b7 \u03bb21d \u2212 1 T 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 T\u2211 t=1 \u2329 (\u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217), 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)] \u232a , (18) where \u03b3t = 1 P \u2211 k\u2208Pt \u03b8tk = \u03b8 t + 1 \u03bb2 ht with P = |Pt|, \u03ba = 10m P 1 \u03bb2 \u03bb2 + \u03b2 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03b22 , \u03ba0 = 2 \u03bb2 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03bb2\u03b2 \u2212 50\u03b22 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03b22 , \u03ba\u2032 = 5 \u03bb2 \u03bb2 + \u03b2 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03b22 = \u03ba \u00b7 P 2m , C0 = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E\u2225\u2207Lk(\u03b80k)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u2217)\u2225, d = dim(\u03b8). To prove the theorem, define variables that will be used throughout the proof. \u03b8\u0303tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8)\u2212 \u2329 \u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ), \u03b8 \u232a + \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u2225 1 \u2200k \u2208 [m] (19) Ct = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E\u2225\u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u2217)\u22252, (20) \u03f5t = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E\u2225\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b3 t\u22121\u22252. (21) Note that \u03b8\u0303tk optimizes the kth loss function by assuming that the kth client (k \u2208 [m]) is selected at round t. It is obvious that \u03b8\u0303tk = \u03b8 t k if k \u2208 Pt. Ct refers to the average of the expected differences between gradients of each individual model and the globally optimal model. Lastly, \u03f5t refers to the deviation of each client model from the average of local models. Remark that Ct and \u03f5t approach zero if all clients\u2019 models converge to the globally optimal model, i.e., \u03b8tk \u2192 \u03b8\u2217. The following lemma expresses ht, how much the averaged active devices\u2019 model deviates from the global model. Lemma B.2. Algorithm 3 satisfies ht = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk) (22) Proof. Starting from the update of ht in Algorithm 3, ht = ht\u22121 \u2212 \u03bb2 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)\u2212 \u03bb1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = ht\u22121 \u2212 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8 t k)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121))\u2212 \u03bb1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = ht\u22121 \u2212 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8 t k)), where the second equality follows from (11). By summing ht recursively, we have ht = h0 + 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b80k) = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk). The next lemma provides how much the average of local models changes by using only t round parameters. Lemma B.3. Algorithm 3 satisfies E[\u03b3t \u2212 \u03b3t\u22121] = 1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)]\u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121)]. Proof. Starting from the definition of \u03b3t, E [ \u03b3t \u2212 \u03b3t\u22121 ] = E [( 1 P \u2211 k\u2208Pt \u03b8tk ) \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 \u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] = E [ 1 P \u2211 k\u2208Pt (\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] = E [ 1 \u03bb2P \u2211 k\u2208Pt (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8 t k)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121))\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] (23) = E [ 1 \u03bb2P \u2211 k\u2208Pt (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121))\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] (24) = E  1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121))\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121  (25) = 1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)]\u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121)], (26) where (23) follows from (11), (24) follows since \u03b8\u0303tk = \u03b8 t k if k \u2208 Pt, and (25) follows since clients are randomly chosen. The last equality is due to Lemma B.2. Next, note that Algorithm 3 is the same as that of FedDyn except for the \u21131-norm penalty. As this new penalty does not affect derivations of Ct, \u03f5t, and E\u2225\u03b3t \u2212 \u03b3t\u22121\u22252 in FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021), we can obtain the following bounds on them. Proofs are omitted for brevity.

B.3 DISCUSSION ON CONVERGENCE: In this section, we revisit the convergence stated in Theorem 3.1. Recall the bound E [ R ( 1 T T\u22121\u2211 t=0 \u03b3t ) \u2212R(\u03b8\u2217) ] \u2264 1 T 1 \u03ba0 (E\u2225\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u22252 + \u03baC0) + 1 \u03ba0 (\u03ba P 2m \u03bb21d) \u2212 1 T 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 T\u2211 t=1 \u2329 \u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217, 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)] \u232a , As we discussed in the main body, the second term is a negligible constant in the range of our hyperparameters as \u03bb1 is of order of 10\u22124 or 10\u22126. Consider the last term where the summand is the inner product between two terms: 1) \u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217, the deviation of the averaged local models from the globally optimal model and 2) the average of sign vectors across clients. The deviation term characterizes how much the averaged local models are different from the global model; thus, we can assume that as training proceeds it vanishes or at least is bounded by a constant vector. To argue the average of sign vectors, assume a special case where the sign vectors sign(\u03b8\u0303tk\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) are IID across clients. To further simplify the argument, let us consider only a single coordinate of the sign vectors, say Xk = sign(\u03b8\u0303tk(i)\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121(i)), and suppose Xk = \u00b11 with probability 0.5 each. Then, the concentration inequality (Durrett, 2019) implies that for any \u03b4 > 0, P  1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] sign(\u03b8\u0303tk)\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 > \u03b4  = P  1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] Xk > \u03b4  \u2264 e\u2212m\u03b422 holds, which vanishes exponentially fast with the number of clients m. Since m is large in many FL scenarios, the average of sign vectors is negligible with high probability, which in turn implies the last term is also negligible.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023. Remember you need to make 3 reviewer agents for each paper. GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Communication-Efficient and Drift-Robust Federated Learning via Elastic Net\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative method that allows many clients to contribute individually to training a global model by sharing local models rather than private data. Each client has a local training dataset, which it does not want to share with the global server. Instead, each client computes an update to the current global model maintained by the server, and only this update is communicated. FL significantly reduces the risks of privacy and security (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a), but it faces crucial challenges that make the federated settings distinct from other classical problems (Li et al., 2020a) such as expensive communication costs and client drift problems due to heterogeneous local training datasets and heterogeneous systems (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016a;b). Communicating models is a critical bottleneck in FL, in particular when the federated network comprises a massive number of devices (Bonawitz et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020a; Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016b). In such a scenario, communication in the federated network may take a longer time than that of local computation by many orders of magnitude because of limited communication bandwidth and device power (Li et al., 2020a). To reduce such communication cost, several strategies have been proposed (Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al., 2016b; Li et al., 2020a). In particular, Konec\u030cny\u0300 et al. (2016b) proposed several methods to form structured local updates and approximate them, e.g., subsampling and quantization. Reisizadeh et al. (2020); Xu et al. (2020) also proposed an efficient quantization method for FL to reduce the communication cost. Also, in general, as the datasets that local clients own are heterogeneous, trained models on each local data are inconsistent with the global model that minimizes the global empirical loss (Karimireddy et al., 2020; Malinovskiy et al., 2020; Acar et al., 2021). This issue is referred to as the client drift problem. In order to resolve the client drift problem, FedProx (Li et al., 2020b) added a proximal term to a local objective function and regulated local model updates. Karimireddy et al. (2020) proposed SCAFFOLD algorithm that transfers both model updates and control variates to resolve the client drift problem. FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) dynamically regularizes local objective functions to resolve the client drift problem. Unlike most prior works focusing on either the communication cost problem or the client drift problem, we propose a technique that effectively resolves the communication cost and client drift problems simultaneously. Contributions In this paper, we propose FedElasticNet, a new framework for communicationefficient and drift-robust FL. It repurposes the \u21131-norm and \u21132-norm regularizers of the elastic net (Zou & Hastie, 2005), by which it successfully improves (i) communication efficiency by adopting the \u21131-norm regularizer and (ii) robustness to heterogeneous local datasets by adopting the \u21132-norm regularizer. FedElasticNet is a general framework; hence, it can be integrated with prior FL algorithms such as FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017), FedProx (Li et al., 2020b), SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020), and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) so as to resolve the client drift problem as well as the communication cost problem. Further, it incurs no additional costs in training. Empirically, we show that FedElasticNet enhances communication efficiency while maintaining the classification accuracy even for heterogeneous datasets, i.e., the client drift problem is resolved. Theoretically, we characterize the impact of the regularizer terms. Table 1 compares the prior methods and the proposed FedElasticNet if integrated with FedDyn (Algorithm 3). 2 RELATED WORK: To address the communication cost and client drift problems, numerous approaches were proposed. Here, we describe closely related works that we consider baseline methods. The comprehensive reviews can be found in Kairouz et al. (2021); Li et al. (2020a). FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) is one of the most commonly used methods. FedAvg tackles the communication bottleneck issue by performing multiple local updates before communicating to the server. It works well for homogeneous datasets across clients (McMahan et al., 2017; Karimireddy et al., 2020), but it is known that FedAvg may diverge when local datasets are heterogeneous (Zhao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a). FedProx (Li et al., 2020b) addressed the data heterogeneity problem. FedProx introduces an \u21132-norm regularizer to the local objective functions to penalize local updates that are far from the server\u2019s model and thus to limit the impact of variable local updates (Li et al., 2020b). Although FedProx is more robust to heterogeneous datasets than FedAvg, the regularizer does not result in aligning the global and local stationary points (Acar et al., 2021). Also, we note that FedProx does not improve communication efficiency compared to that of FedAvg. SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020) defined client drift that the model created by aggregating local models and the optimal global model is inconsistent because of heterogeneous local datasets. SCAFFOLD communicates the trained local models and the clients\u2019 control variates so as to resolve the client drift problem. Hence, SCAFFOLD requires twice the communication cost compared to other FL algorithms. FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) dynamically updates its local regularizers at each round to ensure that the local clients\u2019 optima are asymptotically consistent with stationary points of the global empirical loss. Unlike SCAFFOLD, FedDyn resolves the client drift problem without incurring additional communication costs. However, FedDyn\u2019s communication cost is not improved compared to FedAvg and FedProx. Zou & Hastie (2005) proposed the elastic net to encourage the grouping effect, in other words, to encourage strongly correlated covariates to be in or out of the model description together (Hu et al., 2018). Initially, the elastic net was proposed to overcome the limitations of Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) imposing an \u21131-norm penalty on the model parameters. For instance of a linear least square problem, the objective of Lasso is to solve min \u03b8 \u2225y \u2212X\u03b8\u222522 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u03b8\u22251 , (1) where y is the outcome and X is the covariate matrix. Lasso performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting model. However, it has some limitations, especially for high-dimensional models. If a group of variables is highly correlated, then Lasso tends to select only one variable from the group and does not care which one is selected (Zou & Hastie, 2005). The elastic net overcomes these limitations by adding an \u21132-norm penalty. The objective of the elastic net is to solve min \u03b8 \u2225y \u2212 X\u03b8\u222522 + \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u03b8\u222522 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u03b8\u22251 . (2) The elastic net simultaneously enables automatic variable selection and continuous shrinkage by the \u21131-norm regularizer and enables to select groups of correlated variables by its \u21132-norm regularizer (Zou & Hastie, 2005). We will leverage the elastic net approach to resolve the critical problems of FL: expensive communication cost and client drift problems. 3 PROPOSED METHOD: FEDELASTICNET: We assume that m local clients communicate with the global server. For the kth client (where k \u2208 [m]) participating in each training round, we assume that a training data feature x \u2208 X and its corresponding label y \u2208 Y are drawn IID from a device-indexed joint distribution, i.e., (x, y) \u223c Pk (Acar et al., 2021). The objective is to find argmin \u03b8\u2208Rd R (\u03b8) := 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] Lk (\u03b8)  , (3) where Lk (\u03b8) = Ex\u223cPk [lk (\u03b8; (x, y))] is the local risk of the kth clients over possibly heterogeneous data distributions Pk. Also, \u03b8 represents the model parameters and lk(\u00b7) is a loss function such as cross entropy (Acar et al., 2021). FedElasticNet The proposed method (FedElasticNet) leverages the elastic net approach to resolve the communication cost and client drift problems. We introduce the \u21131-norm and \u21132-norm penalties on the local updates: In each round t \u2208 [T ], the kth local client attempts to find \u03b8tk by solving the following optimization problem: \u03b8tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8) + \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u2225 1 , (4) where \u03b8t\u22121 denotes the global model received from the server. Then, it transmits the difference \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 to the server. Inspired by the elastic net, we introduce two types of regularizers for local objective functions; however, each of them works in a different way so as to resolve each of the two FL problems: the communication cost and client drift problems. First, the \u21132-norm regularizer resolves the client drift problem by limiting the impact of variable local updates as in FedProx (Li et al., 2020b). FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) also adopts the \u21132-norm regularizer to control the client drift. Second, the \u21131-norm regularizer attempts to sparsify the local updates \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121. We consider two ways of measuring communication cost: One is the number of nonzero elements in \u2206tk (Yoon et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2021), which the \u21131-norm sparsifies. The other is the (Shannon) entropy since it is the theoretical lower bound on the data compression (Cover & Thomas, 2006). We demonstrate that the \u21131-norm penalty on the local updates can effectively reduce the number of nonzero elements as well as the entropy in Section 4. To boost sparseness of \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121, we sent \u2206tk(i) = 0 if |\u2206tk(i)| \u2264 \u03f5 where \u2206tk(i) denotes the ith element of \u2206tk. The parameter \u03f5 is chosen in a range that does not affect classification accuracy. Our FedElasticNet approach can be integrated into existing FL algorithms such as FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017), SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020), and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021) without additional costs, which will be described in the following subsections.

As shown in Algorithm 1, the local client minimizes the local objective function (4). In Step 7, n and nk denote the total numbers of data points of all clients and the data points of the kth client, respectively. It is worth mentioning that FedProx uses the \u21132-norm regularizer to address the data and system heterogeneities (Li et al., 2020b). By adding the \u21131-norm regularizer, we can sparsify the local updates of FedProx and thus effectively reduce the communication cost. Notice that Algorithm 1 can be viewed as the integration of FedProx and FedElasticNet. 3.2 FEDELASTICNET FOR SCAFFOLD (SCAFFOLD + ELASTIC NET): In SCAFFOLD, each client computes the following mini-batch gradient\u2207Lk(\u03b8tk) and control variate ctk (Karimireddy et al., 2020): \u03b8tk \u2190 \u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b7l ( \u2207Lk ( \u03b8tk ) \u2212 ct\u22121k + c t\u22121) , (5) ctk \u2190 ct\u22121k \u2212 c t\u22121 + 1 B\u03b7l (\u03b8t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8tk), (6) where \u03b7l is the local step size and B is the number of mini-batches at each round. This control variate makes the local parameters \u03b8tk updated in the direction of the global optimum rather than each local optimum, which effectively resolves the client drift problem. However, SCAFFOLD incurs twice much communication cost since it should communicate the local update \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 and the control variate \u2206ck = ctk \u2212 c t\u22121 k , which are of the same dimension. In order to reduce the communication cost of SCAFFOLD, we apply our FedElasticNet framework. In the proposed algorithm (see Algorithm 2), each local client computes the following mini-batch gradient instead of (5): \u03b8tk \u2190 \u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b7l ( \u2207Lk ( \u03b8tk ) \u2212 ct\u22121k + c t\u22121 + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) + \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) ) , (7) where \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) corresponds to the gradient of \u21131-norm regularizer \u03bb1\u2225\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u22251. This \u21131-norm regularizer sparsifies the local update \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121; hence, reduces the communication cost. Since the control variate already addresses the client drift problem, we can remove the \u21132-norm regularizer or set \u03bb2 as a small value. 3.3 FEDELASTICNET FOR FEDDYN (FEDDYN + ELASTIC NET): In FedDyn, each local client optimizes the following local objective, which is the sum of its empirical loss and a penalized risk function: \u03b8tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8)\u2212 \u27e8\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ), \u03b8\u27e9+ \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 , (8) where the penalized risk is dynamically updated so as to satisfy the following first-order condition for local optima: \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ) + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = 0. (9) This first-order condition shows that the stationary points of the local objective function are consistent with the server model (Acar et al., 2021). That is, the client drift is resolved. However, FedDyn makes no difference from FedAvg and FedProx in communication costs. By integrating FedElasticNet and FedDyn, we can effectively reduce the communication cost of FedDyn as well. In the proposed method (i.e., FedElasticNet for FedDyn), each local client optimizes the following local empirical objective: \u03b8tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8)\u2212 \u27e8\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ), \u03b8\u27e9+ \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u2225 1 , (10) which is the sum of (8) and the additional \u21131-norm penalty on the local updates. The corresponding first-order condition is given by \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ) + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) + \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = 0. (11) Notice that the stationary points of the local objective function are consistent with the server model as in (9). If \u03b8tk \u0338= \u03b8t\u22121 (i.e., sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = \u00b11), then the first-order condition is \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ) + \u03bb2(\u03b8 t k \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = \u00b1\u03bb1, (12) where \u03bb1 is a vectorized one. Our empirical results show that the optimized hyperparameter is \u03bb1 = 10 \u22124 or 10\u22126 and the impact of \u00b1\u03bb1 in (12) would be negligible. Hence, the proposed FedElasticNet for FedDyn resolves the client drift problem. Further, the local update \u2206tk = \u03b8 t k\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 is sparse due to the \u21131-norm regularizer, which effectively reduces the communication cost at the same time. The detailed algorithm is described in Algorithm 3.

Theorem 3.1 provides a convergence rate of FedElasticNet for FedDyn. If T \u2192\u221e, the first term of (13) converges to 0 at the speed of O(1/T ). The second and the third terms of (13) are additional penalty terms caused by the \u21131-norm regularizer. The second term is a negligible constant in the range of hyperparameters of our interest. Considering the last term, notice that the summand at each t includes the expected average of sign vectors where each element is \u00b11. If a coordinate of the sign vectors across clients is viewed as an IID realization of Bern( 12 ), it can be thought of as a small value with high probability by the concentration property (see Appendix B.3). In addition, \u03b3t\u22121\u2212 \u03b8\u2217 characterizes how much the average of local models deviates from the globally optimal model, which tends to be small as training proceeds. Therefore, the effect of both additional terms is negligible. 4 EXPERIMENTS: In this section, we evaluate the proposed FedElasticNet on benchmark datasets for various FL scenarios. In particular, FedElasticNet is integrated with prior methods including FedProx (Li et al., 2020b), SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020), and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021). The experimental results show that FedElasticNet effectively enhances communication efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy and resolving the client drift problem. We observe that the integration of FedElasticNet and FedDyn (Algorithm 3) achieves the best performance. Experimental Setup We use the same benchmark datasets as prior works. The evaluated datasets include MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), a subset of EMNIST (Cohen et al., 2017, EMNIST-L), CIFAR10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), and Shakespeare (Shakespeare, 1914). The IID split is generated by randomly assigning datapoint to the local clients. The Dirichlet distribution is used on the label ratios to ensure uneven label distributions among local clients for non-IID splits as in Zhao et al. (2018); Acar et al. (2021). For the uneven label distributions among 100 experimental devices, the experiments are performed by using the Dirichlet parameters of 0.3 and 0.6, and the number of data points is obtained by the lognormal distribution as in Acar et al. (2021). The data imbalance is controlled by varying the variance of the lognormal distribution (Acar et al., 2021). We use the same neural network models of FedDyn experiments (Acar et al., 2021). For MNIST and EMNIST-L, fully connected neural network architectures with 2 hidden layers are used. The numbers of neurons in the layers are 200 and 100, respectively (Acar et al., 2021). Remark that the model used for MNIST dataset is the same as in Acar et al. (2021); McMahan et al. (2017). For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we use a CNN model consisting of 2 convolutional layers with 64 5\u00d7 5 filters followed by 2 fully connected layers with 394 and 192 neurons and a softmax layer. For the next character prediction task for Shakespeare, we use a stacked LSTM as in Acar et al. (2021). For MNIST, EMNIST-L, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, we evaluate three cases: IID, non-IID with Dirichlet (.6), and non-IID with Dirichlet (.3). Shakespeare datasets are evaluated for IID and non-IID cases as in Acar et al. (2021). We use the batch size of 10 for the MNIST dataset, 50 for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and EMNIST-L datasets, and 20 for the Shakespeare dataset. We optimize the hyperparameters depending on the evaluated datasets: learning rates, \u03bb2, and \u03bb1. Evaluation of Methods We compare the baseline methods (FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and FedDyn) and the proposed FedElasticNet integrations (Algorithms 1, 2, and 3), respectively. We evaluate the communication cost and classification accuracy for non-IID settings of the prior methods and the proposed methods. The robustness of the client drift problem is measured by the classification accuracy of non-IID settings. We report the communication costs in two ways: (i) the number of nonzero elements in transmitted values as in (Yoon et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2021) and (ii) the Shannon entropy of transmitted bits. Note that the Shannon entropy is the theoretical limit of data compression (Cover & Thomas, 2006), which can be achieved by practical algorithms; for instance, Han et al. (2016) used Huffman coding for model compression. We calculate the entropy of discretized values with the bin size of 0.01. Note that the transmitted values are not discretized in FL, and only the discretization is considered to calculate the entropy. The lossy compression schemes (e.g., scalar quantization, vector quantization, etc.) have not been considered since they include several implementational issues which are beyond our research scope. Table 2 reports the number of non-zero elements of the baseline methods with/without FedElasticNet. Basically, the communication costs per round of FedProx and FedDyn are the same; SCAFFOLD suffers from the doubled communication cost because of the control variates. The proposed FedElasticNet integrations (Algorithms 1, 2, and 3) can effectively sparsify the transmitted local updates, which enhances communication efficiency. In particular, the minimal communication cost is achieved when FedElasticNet is integrated with FedDyn (Algorithm 3). It is because the classification accuracy is not degraded even if the transmitted values are more aggressively sparsified in Algorithm 3. Fig. 2 shows the transmitted local updates \u2206tk of Algorithm 3 are sparser than FedDyn and Algorithm 2. Hence, Algorithm 3 (FedElasticNet for FedDyn) achieves the best communication efficiency. Tables 3 and 4 report the Shannon entropy of transmitted bits for the baseline methods with/without FedElasticNet. The communication costs of baseline methods are effectively improved by the FedElasticNet approach. Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 reduce the entropy compared to the their baseline methods. We note that FedElasticNet integrated with FedDyn (Algorithm 3) achieves the minimum entropy, i.e., the minimum communication cost. For FedDyn, we evaluate the Shannon entropy values for two cases: (i) transmit the updated local models \u03b8tk as in Acar et al. (2021) and (ii) transmit the local updates \u2206 t k = \u03b8 t k\u2212\u03b8t\u22121 as in Algorithm 3. We observe that transmitting the local updates \u2206tk instead of the local models \u03b8 t k can reduce the Shannon entropy significantly. Hence, it is beneficial to transmit the local updates \u2206tk even for FedDyn if it adopts an additional compression scheme. The numbers of nonzero elements for two cases (i.e., \u03b8tk and \u2206 t k) are the same for FedDyn. Fig. 1 shows that the FedElasticNet maintains the classification accuracy or incurs marginal degradation. We observe a classification gap between FedProx and Algorithm 1 for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. However, the classification accuracies of FedDyn and Algorithm 3 are almost identical in the converged regime. In particular, Algorithm 3 significantly reduces the Shannon entropy, which can be explained by Fig 2. Fig 2 compares the distributions of the transmitted local updates \u2206tk for FedDyn, Algorithm 2, and Algorithm 3. Because of the \u21131-norm penalty on the local updates, Algorithm 3 makes sparser local updates than FedDyn. The local updates of FedDyn can be modeled by the Gaussian distribution, and the local updates of FedElasticNet can be modeled by the non-Gaussian distribution (similar to the Laplacian distribution). It is well-known that the Gaussian distribution maximizes the entropy for a given variance in information theory Cover & Thomas (2006). Hence, FedElasticNet can reduce the entropy by transforming the Gaussian distribution into the non-Gaussian one. 5 CONCLUSION: We proposed FedElasticNet, a general framework to improve communication efficiency and resolve the client drift problem simultaneously. We introduce two types of penalty terms on the local model updates by repurposing the classical elastic net. The \u21131-norm regularizer sparsifies the local model updates, which reduces the communication cost. The \u21132-norm regularizer limits the impact of variable local updates to resolve the client drift problem. Importantly, our framework can be integrated with prior FL techniques so as to simultaneously resolve the communication cost problem and the client drift problem. By integrating FedElasticNet with FedDyn, we can achieve the best communication efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy for heterogeneous datasets. A APPENDIX:  A.1 EXPERIMENT DETAILS: We provide the details of our experiments. We select the datasets for our experiments, including those used in prior work on federated learning (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020b; Acar et al., 2021). To fairly compare the non-IID environments, the datasets and the experimental environments are the same as those of Acar et al. (2021). Hyperparameters. We describe the hyperparameters used in our experiments in Section 4. We perform a grid search to find the best \u03bb1 and \u03f5 used in the proposed algorithms. Each hyperparameter was selected to double the value as the performance improved. We use the same \u03bb2 as in Acar et al. (2021). SCAFFOLD has the same local epoch and batch size as other algorithms, and SCAFFOLD is not included in Table 4 because other hyperparameters are not required. Table 5 shows the hyperparameters used in our experiments. A.2 REGULARIZER COEFFICIENTS: We selected \u03bb1 over {10\u22122, 10\u22124, 10\u22126, 10\u22128} to observe the impact of \u03bb1 on the classification accuracy. We prefer a larger \u03bb1 to enhance communication efficiency unless the \u21131-norm regularizer does not degrade the classification accuracy. Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the classification accuracy depending on \u03bb1 in the CIFAR-10 dataset with 10% participation rate and Dirichlet (.3). The unit of the cumulative number of elements is 107. In Algorithm 1, we selected \u03bb1 = 10\u22126 to avoid a degradation of classification accuracy (see Fig. 3) and maximize the sparsity of local updates. In this way, we selected the coefficient values \u03bb1 (See Fig.4 for Algorithm 2 and 5 and Algorithm 3). A.3 EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY:  B PROOF: We utilize some techniques in FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021). B.1 DEFINITION: We introduce a formal definition and properties that we will use. Definition B.0.1. A function Lk is \u03b2-smooth if it satisfies \u2225\u2207Lk(x)\u2212\u2207Lk(y)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b2\u2225x\u2212 y\u2225 \u2200x, y. (14) If function Lk is convex and \u03b2-smooth, it satisfies \u2212 \u27e8\u2207Lk(x), z \u2212 y\u27e9 \u2264 \u2212Lk(z) + Lk(y) + \u03b2 2 \u2225z \u2212 x\u22252 \u2200x, y, z. (15) As a consequence of the convexity and smoothness, the following property holds (Nesterov, 2018, Theorem 2.1.5): 1 2\u03b2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2225\u2207Lk(x)\u2212\u2207Lk(x\u2217)\u22252 \u2264 R(x)\u2212R(x\u2217) \u2200x (16) whereR(x) = 1m \u2211m k=1 Lk(x) and \u2207R(x\u2217) = 0. We will also use the relaxed triangle inequality (Karimireddy et al., 2020, Lemma 3):\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 n\u2211 j=1 vj \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2 \u2264 n n\u2211 j=1 \u2225vj\u22252. (17) B.2 PROOF OF THEOREM 3.1: The theorem that we will prove is as follows. Theorem B.1 (Full statement of Theorem 3.1). Assume that the clients are uniformly randomly selected at each round and the individual loss functions {Lk}mk=1 are convex and \u03b2-smooth. Also assume that \u03bb2 > 27\u03b2. Then Algorithm 3 satisfies the following inequality: Letting R(\u03b8) = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] Lk(\u03b8) and \u03b8\u2217 = argmin \u03b8 R(\u03b8), E [ R ( 1 T T\u22121\u2211 t=0 \u03b3t ) \u2212R(\u03b8\u2217) ] \u2264 1 T 1 \u03ba0 (E\u2225\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u22252 + \u03baC0) + \u03ba\u2032 \u03ba0 \u00b7 \u03bb21d \u2212 1 T 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 T\u2211 t=1 \u2329 (\u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217), 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)] \u232a , (18) where \u03b3t = 1 P \u2211 k\u2208Pt \u03b8tk = \u03b8 t + 1 \u03bb2 ht with P = |Pt|, \u03ba = 10m P 1 \u03bb2 \u03bb2 + \u03b2 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03b22 , \u03ba0 = 2 \u03bb2 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03bb2\u03b2 \u2212 50\u03b22 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03b22 , \u03ba\u2032 = 5 \u03bb2 \u03bb2 + \u03b2 \u03bb22 \u2212 25\u03b22 = \u03ba \u00b7 P 2m , C0 = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E\u2225\u2207Lk(\u03b80k)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u2217)\u2225, d = dim(\u03b8). To prove the theorem, define variables that will be used throughout the proof. \u03b8\u0303tk = argmin \u03b8 Lk (\u03b8)\u2212 \u2329 \u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k ), \u03b8 \u232a + \u03bb2 2 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u22252 2 + \u03bb1 \u2225\u2225\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121\u2225\u2225 1 \u2200k \u2208 [m] (19) Ct = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E\u2225\u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u2217)\u22252, (20) \u03f5t = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E\u2225\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b3 t\u22121\u22252. (21) Note that \u03b8\u0303tk optimizes the kth loss function by assuming that the kth client (k \u2208 [m]) is selected at round t. It is obvious that \u03b8\u0303tk = \u03b8 t k if k \u2208 Pt. Ct refers to the average of the expected differences between gradients of each individual model and the globally optimal model. Lastly, \u03f5t refers to the deviation of each client model from the average of local models. Remark that Ct and \u03f5t approach zero if all clients\u2019 models converge to the globally optimal model, i.e., \u03b8tk \u2192 \u03b8\u2217. The following lemma expresses ht, how much the averaged active devices\u2019 model deviates from the global model. Lemma B.2. Algorithm 3 satisfies ht = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk) (22) Proof. Starting from the update of ht in Algorithm 3, ht = ht\u22121 \u2212 \u03bb2 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)\u2212 \u03bb1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = ht\u22121 \u2212 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8 t k)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121))\u2212 \u03bb1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) = ht\u22121 \u2212 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8 t k)), where the second equality follows from (11). By summing ht recursively, we have ht = h0 + 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk)\u2212 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b80k) = 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] \u2207Lk(\u03b8tk). The next lemma provides how much the average of local models changes by using only t round parameters. Lemma B.3. Algorithm 3 satisfies E[\u03b3t \u2212 \u03b3t\u22121] = 1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)]\u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121)]. Proof. Starting from the definition of \u03b3t, E [ \u03b3t \u2212 \u03b3t\u22121 ] = E [( 1 P \u2211 k\u2208Pt \u03b8tk ) \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 \u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] = E [ 1 P \u2211 k\u2208Pt (\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] = E [ 1 \u03bb2P \u2211 k\u2208Pt (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8 t k)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121))\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] (23) = E [ 1 \u03bb2P \u2211 k\u2208Pt (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121))\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121 ] (24) = E  1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] (\u2207Lk(\u03b8t\u22121k )\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)\u2212 \u03bb1sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121))\u2212 1 \u03bb2 ht\u22121  (25) = 1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[\u2212\u2207Lk(\u03b8\u0303tk)]\u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8 t\u22121)], (26) where (23) follows from (11), (24) follows since \u03b8\u0303tk = \u03b8 t k if k \u2208 Pt, and (25) follows since clients are randomly chosen. The last equality is due to Lemma B.2. Next, note that Algorithm 3 is the same as that of FedDyn except for the \u21131-norm penalty. As this new penalty does not affect derivations of Ct, \u03f5t, and E\u2225\u03b3t \u2212 \u03b3t\u22121\u22252 in FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021), we can obtain the following bounds on them. Proofs are omitted for brevity.

Rearranging terms, we prove the claim. Now we are ready to prove the main claim by combining all lemmas. Let us take the sum on both sides of Lemma B.6 over t = 1, . . . , T .

Since \u03ba is positive if \u03bb2 > 27\u03b2, we can eliminate the negative term in the middle. Then, \u03ba0 T\u2211 t=1 E[R(\u03b3t\u22121)\u2212R(\u03b8\u2217)] \u2264 E\u2225\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u22252 + \u03baC0 + T (\u03ba P 2m \u03bb21d) \u2212 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 T\u2211 t=1 \u2329 \u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217, 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)] \u232a . Dividing by T and applying Jensen\u2019s inequality, E [ R( 1 T T\u22121\u2211 t=0 \u03b3t)\u2212R(\u03b8\u2217) ] \u2264 1 T 1 \u03ba0 (E\u2225\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u22252 + \u03baC0) + 1 \u03ba0 (\u03ba P 2m \u03bb21d) \u2212 1 T 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 T\u2211 t=1 \u2329 \u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217, 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)] \u232a , (42) which completes the proof of Theorem B.1. B.3 DISCUSSION ON CONVERGENCE: In this section, we revisit the convergence stated in Theorem 3.1. Recall the bound E [ R ( 1 T T\u22121\u2211 t=0 \u03b3t ) \u2212R(\u03b8\u2217) ] \u2264 1 T 1 \u03ba0 (E\u2225\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u22252 + \u03baC0) + 1 \u03ba0 (\u03ba P 2m \u03bb21d) \u2212 1 T 2\u03bb1 \u03bb2 T\u2211 t=1 \u2329 \u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217, 1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] E[sign(\u03b8\u0303tk \u2212 \u03b8t\u22121)] \u232a , As we discussed in the main body, the second term is a negligible constant in the range of our hyperparameters as \u03bb1 is of order of 10\u22124 or 10\u22126. Consider the last term where the summand is the inner product between two terms: 1) \u03b3t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217, the deviation of the averaged local models from the globally optimal model and 2) the average of sign vectors across clients. The deviation term characterizes how much the averaged local models are different from the global model; thus, we can assume that as training proceeds it vanishes or at least is bounded by a constant vector. To argue the average of sign vectors, assume a special case where the sign vectors sign(\u03b8\u0303tk\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121) are IID across clients. To further simplify the argument, let us consider only a single coordinate of the sign vectors, say Xk = sign(\u03b8\u0303tk(i)\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121(i)), and suppose Xk = \u00b11 with probability 0.5 each. Then, the concentration inequality (Durrett, 2019) implies that for any \u03b4 > 0, P  1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] sign(\u03b8\u0303tk)\u2212 \u03b8t\u22121 > \u03b4  = P  1 m \u2211 k\u2208[m] Xk > \u03b4  \u2264 e\u2212m\u03b422 holds, which vanishes exponentially fast with the number of clients m.

Our FedDC only introduces lightweight\\nmodifications in the local training phase, in which each client utilizes an\\nauxiliary local drift variable to track the gap between the local model\\nparameter and the global model parameters. The key idea of FedDC is to utilize\\nthis learned local drift variable to bridge the gap, i.e., conducting\\nconsistency in parameter-level. The experiment results and analysis demonstrate\\nthat FedDC yields expediting convergence and better performance on various\\nimage classification tasks, robust in partial participation settings, non-iid\\ndata, and heterogeneous clients.', 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11751v1'}, {'title': 'Communication-Efficient and Drift-Robust Federated Learning via Elastic Net', 'authors': ['Seonhyeong Kim', 'Jiheon Woo', 'Daewon Seo', 'Yongjune Kim'], 'published': '2022-10-06T14:12:13+00:00', 'summary': 'Federated learning (FL) is a distributed method to train a global model over\\na set of local clients while keeping data localized.

Since I don't have the specific paper in front of me, this evaluation will be based on common interpretations of how such an algorithm would be designed and analyzed, drawing upon established principles of federated learning and regularized optimization.\\n\\n**FedElasticNet: A Conceptual Overview**\\n\\nThe Elastic Net regularization (a combination of L1 and L2 penalties) is widely used in centralized machine learning for feature selection (L1) and handling multicollinearity/improving stability (L2). Applying this in a federated setting aims to achieve these benefits while respecting privacy and communication constraints.\\n\\nA typical FedElasticNet setup would likely involve:\\n*   **Local Client Updates:** Each client performs local optimization steps on its private data. This might involve a form of proximal gradient descent to handle the non-smooth L1 term, or standard gradient descent if the Elastic Net penalty is primarily applied at the server side or smoothed. A common FL approach is for clients to minimize a local loss plus a proximal term penalizing divergence from the global model.\\n*   **Server Aggregation:** The central server aggregates model updates from clients (e.g., averaging weights). Crucially, the Elastic Net regularization (or at least the L1 part) is often applied *globally* at the server after aggregation, or the global objective being minimized explicitly includes it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Theoretical Convergence Analysis**\\n\\nThe heart of a robust algorithm lies in its theoretical guarantees. For FedElasticNet, a strong analysis would need to address the challenges posed by federated learning (non-IID data, partial participation, communication constraints) in conjunction with the non-smoothness of the L1 penalty.\\n\\n**Assumptions Made in the Convergence Proof:**\\n\\nA typical convergence proof for FedElasticNet would likely rely on some, or all, of the following assumptions:\\n\\n1.  **Smoothness and (Strong) Convexity:**\\n    *   **L-Smoothness:** The local loss functions $f_k(w)$ (and potentially the global loss $F(w)$) are L-smooth, meaning their gradients are Lipschitz continuous. This is standard for gradient-based methods.\\n    *   **$\\\\mu$-Strong Convexity:** The global loss function $F(w)$ (or an augmented version including the L2 regularization) is $\\\\mu$-strongly convex. This is a strong assumption often required for linear convergence rates. Without it (e.g., for non-convex deep learning models), only sublinear rates are typically achievable, or specialized non-convex optimization techniques are needed.\\n    *   **Bounded Variance of Gradients:** The variance of local stochastic gradients is bounded. This helps in controlling the noise introduced by mini-batching.\\n\\n2.  **Data Distribution:**\\n    *   **Bounded Heterogeneity (Non-IID):** While \\\"non-IID\\\" is the norm in FL, a common theoretical assumption is that the divergence between local data distributions and the global distribution (or between client gradients and the true global gradient) is bounded. This is often quantified by bounding the variance of local gradients or the difference between local and global optima.\\n    *   **IID Data (Stronger Assumption):** Some simpler proofs might start by assuming IID data across clients, which greatly simplifies the analysis but is unrealistic for practical FL.\\n\\n3.  **Client Participation:**\\n    *   **Full Participation:** All clients participate in every communication round. This is often relaxed to partial participation ($K$ out of $M$ clients), but the analysis becomes more complex, often requiring assumptions on the sampling mechanism.\\n    *   **Synchronous Updates:** All participating clients complete their local computations and send updates simultaneously.\\n\\n4.  **Optimization Parameters:**\\n    *   **Bounded Local Iterations ($E$):** The number of local epochs/steps ($E$) is fixed and finite.\\n    *   **Learning Rates:** Properly chosen learning rates (e.g., constant or decaying) that are small enough to ensure convergence but large enough to make progress.\\n    *   **Bounded Model Parameters:** The model weights remain within a bounded set.\\n\\n5.  **Regularization Specifics:**\\n    *   **Properties of L1/L2 Norms:** The subgradient properties of the L1 norm are well-understood and are crucial for the analysis. The proof would likely involve proximal operators or subgradient techniques.\\n    *   **Global vs. Local Regularization:** Whether the Elastic Net penalty is applied only at the server, or if clients also incorporate it (perhaps implicitly through a proximal term), impacts the proof. If clients also compute subgradients of the L1 term, the communication of these non-smooth updates needs careful handling.\\n\\n**Strengths of the Theoretical Analysis:**\\n\\n1.  **Handles Non-Smoothness:** A robust analysis of FedElasticNet must properly account for the non-differentiable L1 norm, likely through proximal gradient methods or subgradient descent theory. This is a non-trivial extension compared to purely smooth objectives like those in FedAvg.\\n2.  **Guaranteed Convergence:** If proven, it provides theoretical backing for the algorithm's ability to reach a stationary point or optimal solution.\\n3.  **Quantifiable Rates:** Providing a convergence rate (e.g., $O(1/T)$, $O(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$, or linear) helps understand how quickly the algorithm converges under various conditions.\\n4.  **Insights into Hyperparameter Impact:** The convergence bounds can reveal how parameters like learning rates, number of local epochs ($E$), client participation rate, and regularization strengths ($\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$) affect convergence.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Limitations of the Theoretical Analysis:**\\n\\n1.  **Strong Assumptions:** The assumption of strong convexity ($\\\\mu$-SC) is often too restrictive for many real-world machine learning models, especially deep neural networks. Without it, convergence rates might be significantly slower, or only convergence to a stationary point (not necessarily the global optimum) can be guaranteed for non-convex problems.\\n2.  **IID vs. Non-IID Gap:** While the analysis might claim to handle non-IID data, the \\\"bounded heterogeneity\\\" assumption might be too mild or not reflective of extreme non-IID scenarios often encountered in practice.\\n3.  **Partial Participation Complexity:** If the analysis accounts for partial client participation, the convergence rate often degrades, and the impact needs to be clearly quantified. Simple random sampling of clients might not be sufficient; more sophisticated analysis is required for biased client sampling.\\n4.  **Implicit Communication Cost Analysis:** While the convergence rate depends on communication rounds, the analysis often doesn't explicitly quantify the *bits transmitted* per round, which is the true communication cost.\\n5.  **Practical Hyperparameter Tuning:** The theoretical analysis often assumes optimal or near-optimal hyperparameters. In practice, tuning $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ in a federated setting can be challenging.\\n6.  **Scalability of Proof:** For very large numbers of clients, the theoretical bounds might become loose or impractical.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Novelty Assessment**\\n\\nThe novelty of FedElasticNet depends heavily on the specific methodological contributions.\\n\\n**Potential Areas of Novelty:**\\n\\n1.  **First-time Integration with Rigorous Proof:** While regularization in FL is not new (e.g., FedProx uses a proximal regularization, FedAvg can be seen as implicit regularization), a *rigorous theoretical analysis* of the combined L1 and L2 penalties in a realistic FL setting (non-IID, partial participation) could be novel.\\n2.  **Specific Algorithmic Enhancements:** If the algorithm proposes a novel way to handle the non-smooth L1 penalty (e.g., a new distributed proximal operator, or an efficient way to aggregate subgradients), that would contribute to novelty.\\n3.  **Addressing Specific FL Challenges:** If FedElasticNet specifically tackles issues like robustness to outliers, improved feature selection in a distributed manner, or enhanced generalization in highly heterogeneous environments, that would elevate its novelty.\\n4.  **Theoretical Breakthrough:** Achieving a tighter convergence bound than existing methods for similar problems, or extending the analysis to weaker assumptions (e.g., non-convexity) would be a significant contribution.\\n\\n**Lack of Novelty Concerns (if not addressed):**\\n\\n1.  **Simple Combination:** If it's merely applying existing Elastic Net techniques to FedAvg without significant algorithmic or theoretical modifications to account for FL specificities, its novelty might be limited.\\n2.  **Overlap with Existing FL Regularization:** Algorithms like FedProx already use a form of regularization (L2-like proximal term). The novelty would lie in justifying why Elastic Net is superior or necessary for certain problems.\\n3.  **Re-derivation of Known Results:** If the convergence proof closely mirrors existing proofs for centralized Elastic Net or other FL algorithms with minor modifications, the theoretical novelty might be low.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Practical Effectiveness**\\n\\nPractical effectiveness hinges on how well the algorithm performs on real-world datasets, particularly concerning communication efficiency and accuracy.\\n\\n**Reducing Communication Costs:**\\n\\n*   **Mechanism:** FedElasticNet itself does *not inherently* reduce communication costs beyond what standard FL approaches offer. Like FedAvg, it likely still requires transmitting full model weights (or differences) in each round.\\n*   **Indirect Reduction:** Communication cost reduction in FL is typically achieved through:\\n    *   **Fewer Communication Rounds:** If FedElasticNet converges faster or maintains accuracy with fewer rounds due to its regularization, this would be a significant benefit. This is a common claim for methods with good generalization properties.\\n    *   **Model Sparsity (L1 benefit):** The L1 penalty promotes sparsity. If the resulting global model is sparse, future work *could* involve transmitting only non-zero weights or using sparsification techniques *on top* of FedElasticNet. However, FedElasticNet *by itself* doesn't reduce the *size* of model updates unless explicitly combined with compression techniques.\\n    *   **Larger Local Epochs:** Allowing clients to train for more local epochs ($E > 1$) before communicating reduces communication rounds. This is a general FL strategy, and FedElasticNet's effectiveness would depend on how well it handles this increased local computation without divergence.\\n\\n**Maintaining Accuracy:**\\n\\n*   **Potential for Improved Accuracy/Generalization:**\\n    *   **Robustness to Heterogeneity:** The L2 part of Elastic Net can help stabilize training and improve robustness against noisy or heterogeneous client data.\\n    *   **Feature Selection:** The L1 part can select important features, potentially leading to simpler, more interpretable models with better generalization performance, especially in high-dimensional settings with redundant features. This can indirectly improve accuracy by preventing overfitting.\\n    *   **Overcoming Overfitting:** Regularization generally helps prevent overfitting, leading to better test accuracy.\\n*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art (SOTA):**\\n    *   **FedAvg (Baseline):** FedElasticNet *should* outperform FedAvg in scenarios where regularization is beneficial (high-dimensional data, feature selection needed, potential overfitting) or when data is highly non-IID (where L2 can help stabilize).\\n    *   **FedProx:** FedProx also uses a proximal term for heterogeneity. FedElasticNet would need to demonstrate superior performance due to its explicit L1/L2 combination and feature selection capabilities.\\n    *   **SCAFFOLD/FedAvgM:** These methods focus on variance reduction. FedElasticNet would need to show it can achieve similar or better accuracy benefits from its regularization *without* the complexities of control variates or momentum.\\n    *   **Centralized Elastic Net:** A crucial comparison is to a centralized Elastic Net trained on aggregated data (if data could be centralized). The FL version should aim to approximate this performance.\\n\\n**Clarity of Experimental Setup:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Diverse Datasets:** Using both IID and carefully constructed non-IID datasets (e.g., by label distribution skew) for various tasks (classification, regression).\\n    *   **Relevant Baselines:** Comparing against FedAvg, FedProx, and potentially other relevant FL regularization methods.\\n    *   **Clear Metrics:** Reporting test accuracy, F1-score, sparsity levels (number of zero/near-zero coefficients), and convergence curves (accuracy vs. communication rounds).\\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explaining how $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$, learning rates, and local epochs were chosen (e.g., grid search, validation sets).\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Providing details like random seeds, hardware specs, and code availability.\\n\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Insufficient Non-IID Scenarios:** Often, \\\"non-IID\\\" is too simplistic. More complex heterogeneities (feature distribution skew, concept drift) should be tested.\\n    *   **Limited Model Complexity:** Elastic Net is typically applied to linear models or shallow networks. Evaluating its effectiveness on complex deep learning models is crucial for broader applicability. If applied to deep learning, how the Elastic Net penalty is applied (e.g., to which layers) becomes critical.\\n    *   **Lack of Ablation Studies:** Insufficient analysis of the individual contributions of L1 and L2 penalties, or the impact of varying their strengths.\\n    *   **Comparison to Stronger Baselines:** Omitting comparisons to state-of-the-art FL algorithms focused on non-IID (e.g., FedDR, FedOpt variants).\\n    *   **Real-world Communication Cost:** Not explicitly measuring network traffic (bits transmitted) but only communication rounds.\\n    *   **Scalability Studies:** How performance changes with a very large number of clients and varying client participation rates.\\n    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive are the results to hyperparameter choices?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Strengths of FedElasticNet (if well-executed):**\\n\\n1.  **Robust Regularization:** Combines the benefits of L1 (sparsity, feature selection, interpretability) and L2 (stability, multicollinearity handling, better generalization) in a federated setting.\\n2.  **Potential for Improved Generalization:** Can lead to more robust and generalized models, especially in high-dimensional or noisy data environments.\\n3.  **Theoretical Backing:** Provides formal guarantees for convergence, which is essential for trusting the algorithm's behavior.\\n4.  **Sparsity Benefits:** Could lead to more compact models, which, in future work, might facilitate communication compression or model deployment on resource-constrained devices.\\n\\n### **Overall Weaknesses of FedElasticNet:**\\n\\n1.  **Communication Cost (Direct):** Does not inherently reduce the size of model updates per round unless explicitly combined with compression techniques. Its cost reduction comes from *fewer rounds* if it converges faster.\\n2.  **Hyperparameter Complexity:** Tuning two regularization parameters ($\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$) in a federated setting can be more challenging than in centralized learning, as the optimal values might depend on the global data distribution, which is not directly observable.\\n3.  **Computational Overhead:** Clients might need to perform more complex proximal operations locally, potentially increasing local computation time, though usually negligible compared to training.\\n4.  **Applicability to Deep Learning:** While elastic net is very useful for linear models, its direct application to deep neural networks is not as straightforward. Often, only a subset of parameters or specific layers are regularized.\\n\\n### **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\\n\\n1.  **Theoretical Refinement:**\\n    *   **Weaker Convexity Assumptions:** Extend the analysis to truly non-convex objective functions (relevant for deep learning) or at least to the \\\"Polyak-Lojasiewicz\\\" (PL) condition, which is weaker than strong convexity but still guarantees linear convergence.\\n    *   **Asynchronous Updates:** Analyze convergence under asynchronous communication, which is more realistic in certain FL deployments.\\n    *   **Impact of Heterogeneity:** Provide a more fine-grained analysis of how different types/degrees of data heterogeneity impact the convergence rate.\\n    *   **Tightness of Bounds:** Discuss the tightness of the derived bounds and compare them to theoretical lower bounds if applicable.\\n\\n2.  **Algorithmic Enhancements:**\\n    *   **Adaptive Regularization:** Explore adaptive mechanisms for setting $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ in a federated manner, possibly leveraging meta-learning or federated hyperparameter optimization techniques.\\n    *   **Combined with Communication Compression:** Integrate FedElasticNet with techniques like sparsification, quantization, or differential privacy to truly reduce communication costs per round and enhance privacy.\\n    *   **Dynamic Client Participation:** Study the impact of dynamic client availability and dropouts on convergence and stability.\\n\\n3.  **Empirical Validation:**\\n    *   **Diverse & Complex Datasets:** Evaluate on a wider range of real-world datasets, including larger-scale image/text datasets with deep neural networks.\\n    *   **Robustness Studies:** Assess the algorithm's robustness to data poisoning attacks or adversarial examples, as regularization can sometimes help in this regard.\\n    *   **Real Communication Metrics:** Report total bits transmitted or bandwidth usage, not just communication rounds.\\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** Conduct thorough ablation studies to isolate the impact of the L1 and L2 penalties individually on accuracy, sparsity, and convergence.\\n    *   **Comparison with SOTA Heterogeneity Methods:** Include comparisons with advanced methods like SCAFFOLD, FedAvgM, FedDR, and various personalized FL approaches.\\n    *   **Analysis of Sparsity:** Quantify the sparsity induced by the L1 term and evaluate its impact on model interpretability and deployability.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, FedElasticNet could become a more robust, theoretically sound, and practically impactful algorithm for federated learning, particularly for problems benefiting from sparse and stable models.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.66310285\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"FLOE\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the theoretical convergence analysis of the FedElasticNet algorithm, assess its novelty and practical effectiveness in reducing communication costs while maintaining accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Let's break down its rationale, effectiveness, parameter impact, novelty, and areas for improvement.\\n\\n## 1. Rationale and Effectiveness\\n\\nThe core rationale behind FedElasticNet stems from leveraging the distinct properties of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to address FL-specific issues.\\n\\n### Rationale:\\n\\n*   **Communication Efficiency (via L1 regularization, $\\\\lambda_1$):**\\n    *   **Sparsity Induction:** L1 regularization encourages sparsity in model weights, meaning many weights are driven to exactly zero.\\n    *   **Reduced Transmission Cost:** If clients can transmit only the non-zero weights (sparse updates) or if the model effectively has fewer \\\"active\\\" parameters, the communication payload from clients to the server (and potentially vice-versa) can be significantly reduced. This directly alleviates the communication bottleneck, especially for large models or limited bandwidth.\\n*   **Drift Robustness (via L2 regularization, $\\\\lambda_2$, and partially L1):**\\n    *   **L2 for Stability and Generalization:** L2 regularization penalizes large weights, preventing individual clients from learning overly complex models that fit their specific local data too well (overfitting to local non-IID data). This promotes smoother optimization landscapes, more stable updates, and better generalization to unseen data globally. It acts as a \\\"pull\\\" towards a more generalized, less idiosyncratic model.\\n    *   **L1 for Feature Selection and Common Subspace:** By forcing irrelevant features (weights) to zero, L1 can help identify a common, robust set of features or a \\\"shared subspace\\\" that is truly important across diverse client datasets. This can prevent clients from emphasizing features that are only locally relevant but globally noisy, thereby making the global model more robust to data heterogeneity (drift).\\n    *   **Combined Effect:** Elastic Net, by combining L1 and L2, can achieve both feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage/stability (L2). This is particularly useful when there are groups of correlated features, where L1 might arbitrarily pick one, but L2 ensures that if one is chosen, its correlated counterparts are also considered, leading to better group selection and overall stability than pure L1.\\n\\n### Effectiveness:\\n\\n*   **Potential for High Effectiveness:** If properly tuned, FedElasticNet can indeed be effective.\\n    *   **Sparsity:** For models where some parameters are truly redundant or less critical across heterogeneous data, L1 can effectively prune them, leading to tangible communication savings *if the FL framework supports sparse transmission*.\\n    *   **Drift Robustness:** L2 regularization is a well-established technique for improving model stability and generalization in centralized learning, and its benefits extend to FL by mitigating the tendency of local models to diverge due to non-IID data. The L1 component, by selecting a more fundamental set of features, can further contribute to a more robust global model.\\n*   **Challenges to Effectiveness:**\\n    *   **Sparse Update Mechanism:** The true communication efficiency gain from L1 relies heavily on the underlying FL communication protocol. If the system still transmits full dense vectors, the benefit is only indirect (smaller effective model size, potentially better compressibility) rather than direct (fewer bytes transmitted).\\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ in a distributed setting is non-trivial and can significantly impact effectiveness.\\n    *   **Application to Deep Learning:** While effective for linear models or shallow networks, applying L1 regularization across all layers of deep neural networks can lead to unstructured sparsity, which is harder to leverage for communication benefits without specific architectural modifications (e.g., pruning techniques like filter pruning).\\n\\n## 2. Analysis of Regularization Parameters ($\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$)\\n\\nThe choice of $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ is crucial and dictates the trade-off between model complexity, sparsity, and generalization.\\n\\n*   **$\\\\lambda_1$ (Lasso regularization strength):**\\n    *   **Impact on Sparsity:** Directly controls the level of sparsity.\\n        *   **Small $\\\\lambda_1$:** Less sparsity, weights are shrunk but few are exactly zero. Model might still be complex.\\n        *   **Larger $\\\\lambda_1$:** More sparsity, more weights are driven to exactly zero. Leads to simpler models and acts as a feature selection mechanism.\\n        *   **Very Large $\\\\lambda_1$:** Excessive sparsity, potentially leading to critical features being removed, resulting in underfitting and poor generalization performance. The model might become too simple to capture underlying patterns.\\n    *   **Impact on Generalization Performance:**\\n        *   A well-chosen $\\\\lambda_1$ can improve generalization by selecting a relevant subset of features, reducing noise, and preventing overfitting, especially to idiosyncratic client data.\\n        *   If too high, it leads to underfitting. If too low, it offers less benefit in terms of feature selection and communication efficiency.\\n\\n*   **$\\\\lambda_2$ (Ridge regularization strength):**\\n    *   **Impact on Sparsity:** Does **not** induce sparsity (i.e., rarely pushes weights to exactly zero). It shrinks coefficients towards zero, but they remain non-zero.\\n    *   **Impact on Generalization Performance:**\\n        *   **Small $\\\\lambda_2$:** Less weight shrinkage, higher variance, potentially more prone to overfitting (especially to local client data in FL) and less stable updates.\\n        *   **Larger $\\\\lambda_2$:** Stronger weight shrinkage, prevents weights from becoming excessively large. This stabilizes the learning process, reduces the model's sensitivity to small changes in input data (or local client updates), handles multicollinearity well, and generally improves generalization by reducing variance.\\n        *   **Very Large $\\\\lambda_2$:** Over-regularization, weights become too small, leading to underfitting. The model loses its capacity to learn meaningful patterns.\\n\\n*   **Interplay of $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$:**\\n    *   Elastic Net's power lies in their combination. L1 handles feature selection and sparsity, while L2 handles the grouping effect, stabilizes the model, and addresses multicollinearity among selected features.\\n    *   A typical strategy involves fixing a ratio (e.g., $\\\\alpha = \\\\lambda_1 / (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2)$) and then tuning the overall regularization strength ($\\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2$), or tuning them independently.\\n    *   In FL, $\\\\lambda_1$ would be prioritized for communication efficiency, while $\\\\lambda_2$ would be chosen to balance stability and prevent excessive local divergence. The optimal balance would depend on the specific non-IID level and communication constraints.\\n\\n## 3. Novelty Assessment of FedElasticNet\\n\\nThe concept of Elastic Net regularization is well-established in centralized machine learning, introduced by Zou and Hastie in 2005. Its direct application to the local objective function in Federated Learning, while logical, needs to be assessed relative to existing FL regularization methods.\\n\\n*   **Compared to Existing Regularization-Based FL Methods:**\\n    *   **L2-based (e.g., typical weight decay in optimizers):** Many FL frameworks implicitly or explicitly use L2 regularization (weight decay). FedElasticNet explicitly adds the L1 component, which is a key differentiator for sparsity and feature selection.\\n    *   **Proximal Methods (e.g., FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedAvgM):** These methods introduce a *proximal term* to the local loss function that penalizes the divergence of local model weights from the global model or a control variate. Their primary goal is to explicitly mitigate client drift by keeping local models \\\"close\\\" to a reference.\\n        *   **Difference:** FedElasticNet primarily regularizes the *magnitude* and *sparsity* of the weights themselves, rather than their *divergence* from a specific reference model. While both aim for drift robustness, their mechanisms are different. Elastic Net focuses on learning a robust, sparse model inherently, whereas proximal methods actively pull local updates towards a common point.\\n    *   **Sparsification/Pruning Techniques:** Other FL methods focus on communication efficiency through *post-training sparsification* (pruning models after training) or *sparse update quantization* (e.g., Top-K gradient compression, signSGD).\\n        *   **Difference:** FedElasticNet integrates sparsity *during* the training process via L1, rather than as a post-processing step or a gradient compression technique. It inherently learns a sparse representation.\\n\\n*   **Novelty Conclusion:**\\n    *   The *individual components* (L1, L2, FL) are not novel.\\n    *   The novelty lies more in the **explicit proposition and systematic analysis of Elastic Net as a holistic solution** to simultaneously address *both* communication efficiency (via L1-induced sparsity) and drift robustness (via L2-induced stability and L1-induced feature selection) within the standard FL optimization loop.\\n    *   It's less about a groundbreaking new algorithmic primitive for FL (like FedProx's proximal term) and more about a **principled application and evaluation of a powerful, existing regularization technique** in a novel context with a dual objective. Its simplicity of integration into existing FL frameworks is also noteworthy.\\n\\n## 4. Strengths and Weaknesses\\n\\n### Strengths:\\n\\n1.  **Dual Problem Solution:** Addresses two critical FL challenges (communication and non-IID data) within a single, unified regularization framework.\\n2.  **Inherent Sparsity:** L1 regularization encourages sparsity naturally during training, potentially leading to more meaningful feature selection than post-training pruning.\\n3.  **Model Robustness:** L2 regularization enhances model stability and generalization, crucial for heterogeneous FL environments.\\n4.  **Well-Understood Basis:** Elastic Net is a thoroughly researched and understood technique, offering a strong theoretical foundation.\\n5.  **Simplicity of Integration:** It primarily involves modifying the client-side loss function, making it relatively straightforward to integrate into existing FedAvg-like FL systems.\\n6.  **Handles Correlated Features:** The combination of L1 and L2 is particularly effective when features are correlated, offering a more stable feature selection than pure L1.\\n\\n### Weaknesses:\\n\\n1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Complexity:** Adding two new hyperparameters ($\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$) to an already complex distributed system (FL) significantly increases the tuning burden. Finding optimal values can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\\n2.  **Dependency on Sparse Communication:** The full communication efficiency benefits are only realized if the FL system explicitly supports transmitting sparse models/updates. Without this, the sparsity is primarily conceptual.\\n3.  **Potential for Underfitting:** Over-aggressive regularization (too high $\\\\lambda_1$ or $\\\\lambda_2$) can lead to overly simplistic models that underfit the data, especially for complex tasks or highly diverse datasets.\\n4.  **Generalizability to Deep Networks:** While effective for linear/shallow models, applying L1/L2 to *all* parameters of deep neural networks can lead to unstructured sparsity, which is less practical for hardware efficiency than structured sparsity (e.g., entire filters/neurons being zeroed out).\\n5.  **Competition with Specialized Methods:** While addressing both issues, it might not outperform specialized methods (e.g., Top-K for communication, FedProx/SCAFFOLD for drift) when considered in isolation, or when one problem is significantly more dominant.\\n6.  **Non-differentiability of L1:** The L1 norm is not differentiable at zero, which requires using subgradient methods or approximations (e.g., proximal gradient methods), adding slight complexity to the optimization process.\\n\\n## 5. Suggestions for Improving the Regularization Strategy\\n\\n1.  **Adaptive Regularization Schedule:**\\n    *   **Dynamic $\\\\lambda$ Adjustment:** Instead of fixed $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$, explore schedules where these parameters adapt over FL rounds. For instance, gradually increasing $\\\\lambda_1$ over time could encourage more sparsity as the model converges.\\n    *   **Client-Specific Regularization:** Allow $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$ to vary per client based on their data characteristics (e.g., data diversity, size) or their contribution to global model performance. More diverse clients might need higher $\\\\lambda_2$ to prevent drift.\\n\\n2.  **Structured Sparsity Induction:**\\n    *   Instead of just inducing weight-level sparsity, investigate group Lasso or other structured regularization techniques (e.g., L2,1-norm regularization across rows/columns of weight matrices) to enforce sparsity at the neuron, filter, or channel level. This leads to more practical and hardware-friendly pruning, directly translating to smaller models and faster inference.\\n    *   Integrate with existing pruning frameworks (e.g., magnitude pruning, Lottery Ticket Hypothesis) to ensure that the induced sparsity is truly beneficial for deployment.\\n\\n3.  **Explicit Integration with Sparse Communication Protocols:**\\n    *   The framework should explicitly outline how the L1-induced sparsity can be leveraged by existing sparse communication techniques like Top-K sparsification or sparse federated averaging, possibly by setting small weights to exact zeros during local training or before transmission.\\n    *   Consider quantizing the *remaining* non-zero weights for further communication efficiency.\\n\\n4.  **Hybrid Approaches (Combining with Proximal Methods):**\\n    *   Explore combining FedElasticNet with proximal regularization methods (e.g., FedProx). A local loss function could include both the Elastic Net term *and* a proximal term to regularize against divergence from the global model. This could offer a more comprehensive solution for drift robustness.\\n    *   `Local_Loss = Data_Loss + \u03bb1||w||1 + \u03bb2||w||2^2 + \u00b5||w - w_global||2^2`\\n\\n5.  **Layer-wise/Parameter-Group Wise Regularization:**\\n    *   For deep neural networks, different layers or types of parameters might benefit from different regularization strengths. For instance, earlier layers (feature extractors) might benefit more from L1 for robust feature selection, while deeper layers (classifiers) might benefit more from L2 for stability.\\n    *   This requires careful empirical tuning but could yield superior results.\\n\\n6.  **Theoretical Analysis of Convergence and Generalization:**\\n    *   Provide stronger theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence properties of FedElasticNet under non-IID conditions, especially concerning how $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ influence the convergence rate and the quality of the learned global model.\\n    *   Analyze the trade-offs between communication savings and model performance with varying $\\\\lambda$ values.\\n\\n7.  **Benchmarking against State-of-the-Art:**\\n    *   Beyond comparing to FedAvg, rigorously benchmark FedElasticNet against leading methods specifically designed for communication efficiency (e.g., FedPAQ, QSGD) and drift robustness (e.g., FedProx, SCAFFOLD) across diverse datasets and model architectures. This would clearly establish its competitive advantages and limitations.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, FedElasticNet could evolve into a more robust, versatile, and empirically validated framework for federated learning.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.66185215\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Evaluate the rationale and effectiveness of using elastic net regularization for communication efficiency and drift robustness in federated learning.

Analysis of Performance under Different Non-IID Data Distributions\\n\\nAssuming a well-executed experimental evaluation, the analysis should typically show:\\n\\n*   **Improved Robustness to Non-IIDness:** FedElasticNet should demonstrate higher test accuracy and lower loss compared to basic FedAvg, especially under highly heterogeneous settings (low $\\\\alpha$ values, extreme label skew).\\n*   **Competitive with Drift-Robust Baselines:** It should achieve comparable or superior performance to FedProx, SCAFFOLD, MOON, etc., under various non-IID conditions. The \\\"sweet spot\\\" for FedElasticNet would be scenarios where its specific regularization properties (sparsity, weight decay) are particularly beneficial.\\n*   **Graceful Degradation:** As heterogeneity increases (e.g., $\\\\alpha$ decreases significantly), FedElasticNet's performance should degrade more slowly or maintain a higher floor than less robust algorithms.\\n*   **Convergence Behavior:** It might show faster convergence in some scenarios due to better client model alignment, or slower convergence if the regularization is too strong initially.\\n\\n### 3. Evaluation of Effectiveness in Mitigating Client Drift\\n\\nThis is a critical aspect, as Elastic Net regularization can inherently address some aspects of client drift by pushing client models towards a common, potentially sparse or less complex, solution.\\n\\n*   **Indirect Evidence (Performance-based):**\\n    *   **Higher Global Model Performance:** If FedElasticNet consistently outperforms FedAvg under non-IID conditions, it implicitly suggests better aggregation and less client drift.\\n    *   **Reduced Variance across Clients:** If the final local models of clients are more similar to each other (or to the global model) compared to FedAvg, it indicates reduced drift.\\n*   **Direct Evidence (Quantifiable Drift Metrics):**\\n    *   **Distance between Local and Global Models:** Measuring the average L2 norm (or cosine similarity) between client local models and the server's global model *before* local updates, and *after* local updates in each round. A smaller average distance *after* local updates, or slower divergence *during* local training, would indicate better drift mitigation.\\n    *   **Gradient Divergence:** Analyzing the similarity of gradients computed by different clients or the difference between local gradients and the server's aggregated gradient.\\n    *   **Model Divergence over Rounds:** Tracking how individual client models evolve over communication rounds. FedElasticNet should ideally keep them more \\\"aligned\\\" than FedAvg.\\n*   **Comparison to Drift-Robust Algorithms:**\\n    *   **Head-to-head performance:** Is FedElasticNet consistently better than FedProx or SCAFFOLD in reducing explicit drift metrics? For instance, FedProx directly regularizes client updates towards the global model. FedElasticNet achieves this through weight regularization. The comparison should clarify which mechanism is more effective in various scenarios.\\n    *   **Mechanistic Insights:** Does Elastic Net achieve drift mitigation by promoting feature selection (L1) or by keeping weights small and stable (L2), thus preventing extreme client-specific adaptations?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement in the Experimental Evaluation\\n\\nAssuming typical limitations often seen in FL research:\\n\\n1.  **Limited Diversity of Heterogeneity Types:** Often, evaluations focus heavily on label skew (Dirichlet) and quantity skew.\\n    *   *Missing:* Concept drift (data distribution changes over time on clients), feature shift (same labels, but input features differ significantly, e.g., different camera types), adversarial heterogeneity (some clients try to poison data).\\n2.  **Insufficient Direct Quantification of Client Drift:** Many papers infer drift mitigation from improved accuracy. Directly measuring and visualizing model divergence (e.g., using t-SNE on model weights, or tracking L2 distances between local and global models) is often overlooked.\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** While tuning is done, a more robust analysis of how sensitive FedElasticNet's performance is to different $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$ values across *various* non-IID settings is crucial. Is there a single robust set of parameters, or does it need re-tuning for each new level of heterogeneity?\\n4.  **Computational and Communication Overhead:**\\n    *   **Communication Cost:** Does Elastic Net regularization affect model size or transmission overhead? (Generally not, unless it's used for dynamic pruning which isn't standard ElasticNet.)\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Does the regularization add significant computation to local training or server aggregation?\\n5.  **Lack of Deeper Insights into the Mechanism:** While results show \\\"it works,\\\" the paper might not delve deep enough into *why* FedElasticNet mitigates drift.\\n    *   Does it lead to more interpretable (sparser) models?\\n    *   Does it implicitly encourage feature sharing across clients?\\n    *   How do the weights of FedElasticNet models differ from FedAvg models on clients?\\n6.  **Scalability Analysis:** How does FedElasticNet perform with a very large number of clients, or with high client participation rates? Does its regularization scheme scale effectively?\\n7.  **Robustness to Other Factors:** How does FedElasticNet perform with client failures, adversarial attacks, or noisy labels (beyond just non-IID)? While not the primary focus, it contributes to overall robustness.\\n8.  **Fairness Metrics:** In highly heterogeneous scenarios, average accuracy might not tell the whole story. Are there clients that perform significantly worse or better? Evaluating fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equality of opportunity) could provide a more nuanced view.\\n9.  **Real-world Complex Scenarios:** Most evaluations stick to standard benchmarks. Testing on more complex, large-scale, and messy real-world federated datasets (e.g., healthcare, financial, IoT) would significantly strengthen the claims.\\n\\n### 5. Specific Suggestions for Improving the Assessment of Robustness to Data Heterogeneity\\n\\n1.  **Expand Non-IID Scenarios:**\\n    *   Include **Concept Shift/Drift**: Simulate situations where the underlying data distribution on a client changes over time, or where different clients learn different \\\"tasks\\\" over time.\\n    *   Incorporate **Feature Skew with Different Magnitudes**: Beyond just Dirichlet, use techniques to create domain shifts (e.g., using different pre-processing on client images, or using different sensor data distributions).\\n    *   Test with **Missing Features/Data Imputation**: If applicable, evaluate how FedElasticNet handles clients with incomplete data.\\n\\n2.  **Quantify Client Drift Explicitly:**\\n    *   **Model Divergence Tracking:** For each client $k$ and round $t$, compute $D(w_{k,t}, w_{t}^{global})$, where $w_{k,t}$ is the model *before* local updates and $w_{t}^{global}$ is the global model for that round. Also, track $D(w_{k,t}', w_{t}^{global})$ after local updates $w_{k,t}'$. Visualize these distances over rounds for different heterogeneity levels and compare to baselines.\\n    *   **Gradient Divergence:** Compare the average cosine similarity or L2 distance of local gradients to the global aggregated gradient across clients.\\n    *   **Visualization of Local Models:** Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE) to visualize the embedding of client model weights over time, showing how clustered or dispersed they are for FedElasticNet versus other methods.\\n\\n3.  **Detailed Hyperparameter Robustness Analysis:**\\n    *   Provide heatmaps or sensitivity plots showing test accuracy (and possibly drift metrics) as a function of $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ for different levels of non-IIDness. This will inform practitioners on tuning.\\n    *   Discuss the trade-offs: when is more L1 or L2 regularization beneficial, and when does it hurt performance (e.g., too much L1 might make models too simple for complex tasks).\\n\\n4.  **In-depth Analysis of Learned Models:**\\n    *   **Sparsity Analysis (for L1):** Quantify the percentage of zero/near-zero weights in client models and the global model under FedElasticNet, compared to baselines. Does it truly induce sparsity and reduce model complexity?\\n    *   **Feature Importance Analysis:** For simpler models, analyze which features are selected/emphasized by ElasticNet across clients. Does it identify robust common features?\\n    *   **Weight Distribution Histograms:** Visualize the distribution of weights to see if ElasticNet shifts them towards zero or keeps them tighter around common values.\\n\\n5.  **Scalability and Resource Efficiency:**\\n    *   Conduct experiments with a much larger number of clients (e.g., 1000+), varying the number of active clients per round.\\n    *   Measure wall-clock time for training rounds and total training time.\\n    *   Discuss communication payload if the regularization impacts model size.\\n\\n6.  **Fairness Metrics:**\\n    *   Report worst-performing client accuracy, standard deviation of client accuracies, or specific fairness metrics (e.g., average accuracy for clients with minority classes) under severe non-IID conditions.\\n\\n7.  **Comparison to Specific Drift Mitigation Techniques:**\\n    *   Explicitly discuss how FedElasticNet's *implicit* drift mitigation (via regularization) compares to *explicit* techniques like FedProx (proximal term) or SCAFFOLD (control variates) in terms of computational overhead, convergence, and final performance.\\n\\nBy incorporating these detailed considerations and suggestions, the experimental evaluation of FedElasticNet's robustness to heterogeneous datasets would be significantly strengthened, providing a more comprehensive and insightful understanding of its capabilities and limitations.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.66081145\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Assess the experimental setup for evaluating the robustness of FedElasticNet to heterogeneous datasets.

Since I don\\'t have the specific paper in front of me, this evaluation will be based on common interpretations of how such an algorithm would be designed and analyzed, drawing upon established principles of federated learning and regularized optimization.\\n\\n**FedElasticNet: A Conceptual Overview**\\n\\nThe Elastic Net regularization (a combination of L1 and L2 penalties) is widely used in centralized machine learning for feature selection (L1) and handling multicollinearity/improving stability (L2). Applying this in a federated setting aims to achieve these benefits while respecting privacy and communication constraints.\\n\\nA typical FedElasticNet setup would likely involve:\\n*   **Local Client Updates:** Each client performs local optimization steps on its private data. This might involve a form of proximal gradient descent to handle the non-smooth L1 term, or standard gradient descent if the Elastic Net penalty is primarily applied at the server side or smoothed. A common FL approach is for clients to minimize a local loss plus a proximal term penalizing divergence from the global model.\\n*   **Server Aggregation:** The central server aggregates model updates from clients (e.g., averaging weights). Crucially, the Elastic Net regularization (or at least the L1 part) is often applied *globally* at the server after aggregation, or the global objective being minimized explicitly includes it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Theoretical Convergence Analysis**\\n\\nThe heart of a robust algorithm lies in its theoretical guarantees. For FedElasticNet, a strong analysis would need to address the challenges posed by federated learning (non-IID data, partial participation, communication constraints) in conjunction with the non-smoothness of the L1 penalty.\\n\\n**Assumptions Made in the Convergence Proof:**\\n\\nA typical convergence proof for FedElasticNet would likely rely on some, or all, of the following assumptions:\\n\\n1.  **Smoothness and (Strong) Convexity:**\\n    *   **L-Smoothness:** The local loss functions $f_k(w)$ (and potentially the global loss $F(w)$) are L-smooth, meaning their gradients are Lipschitz continuous. This is standard for gradient-based methods.\\n    *   **$\\\\mu$-Strong Convexity:** The global loss function $F(w)$ (or an augmented version including the L2 regularization) is $\\\\mu$-strongly convex. This is a strong assumption often required for linear convergence rates. Without it (e.g., for non-convex deep learning models), only sublinear rates are typically achievable, or specialized non-convex optimization techniques are needed.\\n    *   **Bounded Variance of Gradients:** The variance of local stochastic gradients is bounded. This helps in controlling the noise introduced by mini-batching.\\n\\n2.  **Data Distribution:**\\n    *   **Bounded Heterogeneity (Non-IID):** While \"non-IID\" is the norm in FL, a common theoretical assumption is that the divergence between local data distributions and the global distribution (or between client gradients and the true global gradient) is bounded. This is often quantified by bounding the variance of local gradients or the difference between local and global optima.\\n    *   **IID Data (Stronger Assumption):** Some simpler proofs might start by assuming IID data across clients, which greatly simplifies the analysis but is unrealistic for practical FL.\\n\\n3.  **Client Participation:**\\n    *   **Full Participation:** All clients participate in every communication round. This is often relaxed to partial participation ($K$ out of $M$ clients), but the analysis becomes more complex, often requiring assumptions on the sampling mechanism.\\n    *   **Synchronous Updates:** All participating clients complete their local computations and send updates simultaneously.\\n\\n4.  **Optimization Parameters:**\\n    *   **Bounded Local Iterations ($E$):** The number of local epochs/steps ($E$) is fixed and finite.\\n    *   **Learning Rates:** Properly chosen learning rates (e.g., constant or decaying) that are small enough to ensure convergence but large enough to make progress.\\n    *   **Bounded Model Parameters:** The model weights remain within a bounded set.\\n\\n5.  **Regularization Specifics:**\\n    *   **Properties of L1/L2 Norms:** The subgradient properties of the L1 norm are well-understood and are crucial for the analysis. The proof would likely involve proximal operators or subgradient techniques.\\n    *   **Global vs. Local Regularization:** Whether the Elastic Net penalty is applied only at the server, or if clients also incorporate it (perhaps implicitly through a proximal term), impacts the proof. If clients also compute subgradients of the L1 term, the communication of these non-smooth updates needs careful handling.\\n\\n**Strengths of the Theoretical Analysis:**\\n\\n1.  **Handles Non-Smoothness:** A robust analysis of FedElasticNet must properly account for the non-differentiable L1 norm, likely through proximal gradient methods or subgradient descent theory. This is a non-trivial extension compared to purely smooth objectives like those in FedAvg.\\n2.  **Guaranteed Convergence:** If proven, it provides theoretical backing for the algorithm\\'s ability to reach a stationary point or optimal solution.\\n3.  **Quantifiable Rates:** Providing a convergence rate (e.g., $O(1/T)$, $O(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$, or linear) helps understand how quickly the algorithm converges under various conditions.\\n4.  **Insights into Hyperparameter Impact:** The convergence bounds can reveal how parameters like learning rates, number of local epochs ($E$), client participation rate, and regularization strengths ($\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$) affect convergence.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Limitations of the Theoretical Analysis:**\\n\\n1.  **Strong Assumptions:** The assumption of strong convexity ($\\\\mu$-SC) is often too restrictive for many real-world machine learning models, especially deep neural networks. Without it, convergence rates might be significantly slower, or only convergence to a stationary point (not necessarily the global optimum) can be guaranteed for non-convex problems.\\n2.  **IID vs. Non-IID Gap:** While the analysis might claim to handle non-IID data, the \"bounded heterogeneity\" assumption might be too mild or not reflective of extreme non-IID scenarios often encountered in practice.\\n3.  **Partial Participation Complexity:** If the analysis accounts for partial client participation, the convergence rate often degrades, and the impact needs to be clearly quantified. Simple random sampling of clients might not be sufficient; more sophisticated analysis is required for biased client sampling.\\n4.  **Implicit Communication Cost Analysis:** While the convergence rate depends on communication rounds, the analysis often doesn\\'t explicitly quantify the *bits transmitted* per round, which is the true communication cost.\\n5.  **Practical Hyperparameter Tuning:** The theoretical analysis often assumes optimal or near-optimal hyperparameters. In practice, tuning $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ in a federated setting can be challenging.\\n6.  **Scalability of Proof:** For very large numbers of clients, the theoretical bounds might become loose or impractical.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Novelty Assessment**\\n\\nThe novelty of FedElasticNet depends heavily on the specific methodological contributions.\\n\\n**Potential Areas of Novelty:**\\n\\n1.  **First-time Integration with Rigorous Proof:** While regularization in FL is not new (e.g., FedProx uses a proximal regularization, FedAvg can be seen as implicit regularization), a *rigorous theoretical analysis* of the combined L1 and L2 penalties in a realistic FL setting (non-IID, partial participation) could be novel.\\n2.  **Specific Algorithmic Enhancements:** If the algorithm proposes a novel way to handle the non-smooth L1 penalty (e.g., a new distributed proximal operator, or an efficient way to aggregate subgradients), that would contribute to novelty.\\n3.  **Addressing Specific FL Challenges:** If FedElasticNet specifically tackles issues like robustness to outliers, improved feature selection in a distributed manner, or enhanced generalization in highly heterogeneous environments, that would elevate its novelty.\\n4.  **Theoretical Breakthrough:** Achieving a tighter convergence bound than existing methods for similar problems, or extending the analysis to weaker assumptions (e.g., non-convexity) would be a significant contribution.\\n\\n**Lack of Novelty Concerns (if not addressed):**\\n\\n1.  **Simple Combination:** If it\\'s merely applying existing Elastic Net techniques to FedAvg without significant algorithmic or theoretical modifications to account for FL specificities, its novelty might be limited.\\n2.  **Overlap with Existing FL Regularization:** Algorithms like FedProx already use a form of regularization (L2-like proximal term). The novelty would lie in justifying why Elastic Net is superior or necessary for certain problems.\\n3.  **Re-derivation of Known Results:** If the convergence proof closely mirrors existing proofs for centralized Elastic Net or other FL algorithms with minor modifications, the theoretical novelty might be low.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Practical Effectiveness**\\n\\nPractical effectiveness hinges on how well the algorithm performs on real-world datasets, particularly concerning communication efficiency and accuracy.\\n\\n**Reducing Communication Costs:**\\n\\n*   **Mechanism:** FedElasticNet itself does *not inherently* reduce communication costs beyond what standard FL approaches offer. Like FedAvg, it likely still requires transmitting full model weights (or differences) in each round.\\n*   **Indirect Reduction:** Communication cost reduction in FL is typically achieved through:\\n    *   **Fewer Communication Rounds:** If FedElasticNet converges faster or maintains accuracy with fewer rounds due to its regularization, this would be a significant benefit. This is a common claim for methods with good generalization properties.\\n    *   **Model Sparsity (L1 benefit):** The L1 penalty promotes sparsity. If the resulting global model is sparse, future work *could* involve transmitting only non-zero weights or using sparsification techniques *on top* of FedElasticNet. However, FedElasticNet *by itself* doesn\\'t reduce the *size* of model updates unless explicitly combined with compression techniques.\\n    *   **Larger Local Epochs:** Allowing clients to train for more local epochs ($E > 1$) before communicating reduces communication rounds. This is a general FL strategy, and FedElasticNet\\'s effectiveness would depend on how well it handles this increased local computation without divergence.\\n\\n**Maintaining Accuracy:**\\n\\n*   **Potential for Improved Accuracy/Generalization:**\\n    *   **Robustness to Heterogeneity:** The L2 part of Elastic Net can help stabilize training and improve robustness against noisy or heterogeneous client data.\\n    *   **Feature Selection:** The L1 part can select important features, potentially leading to simpler, more interpretable models with better generalization performance, especially in high-dimensional settings with redundant features. This can indirectly improve accuracy by preventing overfitting.\\n    *   **Overcoming Overfitting:** Regularization generally helps prevent overfitting, leading to better test accuracy.\\n*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art (SOTA):**\\n    *   **FedAvg (Baseline):** FedElasticNet *should* outperform FedAvg in scenarios where regularization is beneficial (high-dimensional data, feature selection needed, potential overfitting) or when data is highly non-IID (where L2 can help stabilize).\\n    *   **FedProx:** FedProx also uses a proximal term for heterogeneity. FedElasticNet would need to demonstrate superior performance due to its explicit L1/L2 combination and feature selection capabilities.\\n    *   **SCAFFOLD/FedAvgM:** These methods focus on variance reduction. FedElasticNet would need to show it can achieve similar or better accuracy benefits from its regularization *without* the complexities of control variates or momentum.\\n    *   **Centralized Elastic Net:** A crucial comparison is to a centralized Elastic Net trained on aggregated data (if data could be centralized). The FL version should aim to approximate this performance.\\n\\n**Clarity of Experimental Setup:**\\n\\n*   **Strengths:**\\n    *   **Diverse Datasets:** Using both IID and carefully constructed non-IID datasets (e.g., by label distribution skew) for various tasks (classification, regression).\\n    *   **Relevant Baselines:** Comparing against FedAvg, FedProx, and potentially other relevant FL regularization methods.\\n    *   **Clear Metrics:** Reporting test accuracy, F1-score, sparsity levels (number of zero/near-zero coefficients), and convergence curves (accuracy vs. communication rounds).\\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explaining how $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$, learning rates, and local epochs were chosen (e.g., grid search, validation sets).\\n    *   **Reproducibility:** Providing details like random seeds, hardware specs, and code availability.\\n\\n*   **Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\\n    *   **Insufficient Non-IID Scenarios:** Often, \"non-IID\" is too simplistic. More complex heterogeneities (feature distribution skew, concept drift) should be tested.\\n    *   **Limited Model Complexity:** Elastic Net is typically applied to linear models or shallow networks. Evaluating its effectiveness on complex deep learning models is crucial for broader applicability. If applied to deep learning, how the Elastic Net penalty is applied (e.g., to which layers) becomes critical.\\n    *   **Lack of Ablation Studies:** Insufficient analysis of the individual contributions of L1 and L2 penalties, or the impact of varying their strengths.\\n    *   **Comparison to Stronger Baselines:** Omitting comparisons to state-of-the-art FL algorithms focused on non-IID (e.g., FedDR, FedOpt variants).\\n    *   **Real-world Communication Cost:** Not explicitly measuring network traffic (bits transmitted) but only communication rounds.\\n    *   **Scalability Studies:** How performance changes with a very large number of clients and varying client participation rates.\\n    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive are the results to hyperparameter choices?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Strengths of FedElasticNet (if well-executed):**\\n\\n1.  **Robust Regularization:** Combines the benefits of L1 (sparsity, feature selection, interpretability) and L2 (stability, multicollinearity handling, better generalization) in a federated setting.\\n2.  **Potential for Improved Generalization:** Can lead to more robust and generalized models, especially in high-dimensional or noisy data environments.\\n3.  **Theoretical Backing:** Provides formal guarantees for convergence, which is essential for trusting the algorithm\\'s behavior.\\n4.  **Sparsity Benefits:** Could lead to more compact models, which, in future work, might facilitate communication compression or model deployment on resource-constrained devices.\\n\\n### **Overall Weaknesses of FedElasticNet:**\\n\\n1.  **Communication Cost (Direct):** Does not inherently reduce the size of model updates per round unless explicitly combined with compression techniques. Its cost reduction comes from *fewer rounds* if it converges faster.\\n2.  **Hyperparameter Complexity:** Tuning two regularization parameters ($\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$) in a federated setting can be more challenging than in centralized learning, as the optimal values might depend on the global data distribution, which is not directly observable.\\n3.  **Computational Overhead:** Clients might need to perform more complex proximal operations locally, potentially increasing local computation time, though usually negligible compared to training.\\n4.  **Applicability to Deep Learning:** While elastic net is very useful for linear models, its direct application to deep neural networks is not as straightforward. Often, only a subset of parameters or specific layers are regularized.\\n\\n### **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\\n\\n1.  **Theoretical Refinement:**\\n    *   **Weaker Convexity Assumptions:** Extend the analysis to truly non-convex objective functions (relevant for deep learning) or at least to the \"Polyak-Lojasiewicz\" (PL) condition, which is weaker than strong convexity but still guarantees linear convergence.\\n    *   **Asynchronous Updates:** Analyze convergence under asynchronous communication, which is more realistic in certain FL deployments.\\n    *   **Impact of Heterogeneity:** Provide a more fine-grained analysis of how different types/degrees of data heterogeneity impact the convergence rate.\\n    *   **Tightness of Bounds:** Discuss the tightness of the derived bounds and compare them to theoretical lower bounds if applicable.\\n\\n2.  **Algorithmic Enhancements:**\\n    *   **Adaptive Regularization:** Explore adaptive mechanisms for setting $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ in a federated manner, possibly leveraging meta-learning or federated hyperparameter optimization techniques.\\n    *   **Combined with Communication Compression:** Integrate FedElasticNet with techniques like sparsification, quantization, or differential privacy to truly reduce communication costs per round and enhance privacy.\\n    *   **Dynamic Client Participation:** Study the impact of dynamic client availability and dropouts on convergence and stability.\\n\\n3.  **Empirical Validation:**\\n    *   **Diverse & Complex Datasets:** Evaluate on a wider range of real-world datasets, including larger-scale image/text datasets with deep neural networks.\\n    *   **Robustness Studies:** Assess the algorithm\\'s robustness to data poisoning attacks or adversarial examples, as regularization can sometimes help in this regard.\\n    *   **Real Communication Metrics:** Report total bits transmitted or bandwidth usage, not just communication rounds.\\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** Conduct thorough ablation studies to isolate the impact of the L1 and L2 penalties individually on accuracy, sparsity, and convergence.\\n    *   **Comparison with SOTA Heterogeneity Methods:** Include comparisons with advanced methods like SCAFFOLD, FedAvgM, FedDR, and various personalized FL approaches.\\n    *   **Analysis of Sparsity:** Quantify the sparsity induced by the L1 term and evaluate its impact on model interpretability and deployability.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, FedElasticNet could become a more robust, theoretically sound, and practically impactful algorithm for federated learning, particularly for problems benefiting from sparse and stable models.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.66310285}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'Using Elastic Net regularization in Federated Learning (FedElasticNet) presents an interesting approach to tackle two significant challenges: communication efficiency and drift robustness. Let\\'s break down its rationale, effectiveness, parameter impact, novelty, and areas for improvement.\\n\\n## 1. Rationale and Effectiveness\\n\\nThe core rationale behind FedElasticNet stems from leveraging the distinct properties of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to address FL-specific issues.\\n\\n### Rationale:\\n\\n*   **Communication Efficiency (via L1 regularization, $\\\\lambda_1$):**\\n    *   **Sparsity Induction:** L1 regularization encourages sparsity in model weights, meaning many weights are driven to exactly zero.\\n    *   **Reduced Transmission Cost:** If clients can transmit only the non-zero weights (sparse updates) or if the model effectively has fewer \"active\" parameters, the communication payload from clients to the server (and potentially vice-versa) can be significantly reduced. This directly alleviates the communication bottleneck, especially for large models or limited bandwidth.\\n*   **Drift Robustness (via L2 regularization, $\\\\lambda_2$, and partially L1):**\\n    *   **L2 for Stability and Generalization:** L2 regularization penalizes large weights, preventing individual clients from learning overly complex models that fit their specific local data too well (overfitting to local non-IID data). This promotes smoother optimization landscapes, more stable updates, and better generalization to unseen data globally. It acts as a \"pull\" towards a more generalized, less idiosyncratic model.\\n    *   **L1 for Feature Selection and Common Subspace:** By forcing irrelevant features (weights) to zero, L1 can help identify a common, robust set of features or a \"shared subspace\" that is truly important across diverse client datasets. This can prevent clients from emphasizing features that are only locally relevant but globally noisy, thereby making the global model more robust to data heterogeneity (drift).\\n    *   **Combined Effect:** Elastic Net, by combining L1 and L2, can achieve both feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage/stability (L2). This is particularly useful when there are groups of correlated features, where L1 might arbitrarily pick one, but L2 ensures that if one is chosen, its correlated counterparts are also considered, leading to better group selection and overall stability than pure L1.\\n\\n### Effectiveness:\\n\\n*   **Potential for High Effectiveness:** If properly tuned, FedElasticNet can indeed be effective.\\n    *   **Sparsity:** For models where some parameters are truly redundant or less critical across heterogeneous data, L1 can effectively prune them, leading to tangible communication savings *if the FL framework supports sparse transmission*.\\n    *   **Drift Robustness:** L2 regularization is a well-established technique for improving model stability and generalization in centralized learning, and its benefits extend to FL by mitigating the tendency of local models to diverge due to non-IID data. The L1 component, by selecting a more fundamental set of features, can further contribute to a more robust global model.\\n*   **Challenges to Effectiveness:**\\n    *   **Sparse Update Mechanism:** The true communication efficiency gain from L1 relies heavily on the underlying FL communication protocol. If the system still transmits full dense vectors, the benefit is only indirect (smaller effective model size, potentially better compressibility) rather than direct (fewer bytes transmitted).\\n    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ in a distributed setting is non-trivial and can significantly impact effectiveness.\\n    *   **Application to Deep Learning:** While effective for linear models or shallow networks, applying L1 regularization across all layers of deep neural networks can lead to unstructured sparsity, which is harder to leverage for communication benefits without specific architectural modifications (e.g., pruning techniques like filter pruning).\\n\\n## 2. Analysis of Regularization Parameters ($\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$)\\n\\nThe choice of $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ is crucial and dictates the trade-off between model complexity, sparsity, and generalization.\\n\\n*   **$\\\\lambda_1$ (Lasso regularization strength):**\\n    *   **Impact on Sparsity:** Directly controls the level of sparsity.\\n        *   **Small $\\\\lambda_1$:** Less sparsity, weights are shrunk but few are exactly zero. Model might still be complex.\\n        *   **Larger $\\\\lambda_1$:** More sparsity, more weights are driven to exactly zero. Leads to simpler models and acts as a feature selection mechanism.\\n        *   **Very Large $\\\\lambda_1$:** Excessive sparsity, potentially leading to critical features being removed, resulting in underfitting and poor generalization performance. The model might become too simple to capture underlying patterns.\\n    *   **Impact on Generalization Performance:**\\n        *   A well-chosen $\\\\lambda_1$ can improve generalization by selecting a relevant subset of features, reducing noise, and preventing overfitting, especially to idiosyncratic client data.\\n        *   If too high, it leads to underfitting. If too low, it offers less benefit in terms of feature selection and communication efficiency.\\n\\n*   **$\\\\lambda_2$ (Ridge regularization strength):**\\n    *   **Impact on Sparsity:** Does **not** induce sparsity (i.e., rarely pushes weights to exactly zero). It shrinks coefficients towards zero, but they remain non-zero.\\n    *   **Impact on Generalization Performance:**\\n        *   **Small $\\\\lambda_2$:** Less weight shrinkage, higher variance, potentially more prone to overfitting (especially to local client data in FL) and less stable updates.\\n        *   **Larger $\\\\lambda_2$:** Stronger weight shrinkage, prevents weights from becoming excessively large. This stabilizes the learning process, reduces the model\\'s sensitivity to small changes in input data (or local client updates), handles multicollinearity well, and generally improves generalization by reducing variance.\\n        *   **Very Large $\\\\lambda_2$:** Over-regularization, weights become too small, leading to underfitting. The model loses its capacity to learn meaningful patterns.\\n\\n*   **Interplay of $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$:**\\n    *   Elastic Net\\'s power lies in their combination. L1 handles feature selection and sparsity, while L2 handles the grouping effect, stabilizes the model, and addresses multicollinearity among selected features.\\n    *   A typical strategy involves fixing a ratio (e.g., $\\\\alpha = \\\\lambda_1 / (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2)$) and then tuning the overall regularization strength ($\\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2$), or tuning them independently.\\n    *   In FL, $\\\\lambda_1$ would be prioritized for communication efficiency, while $\\\\lambda_2$ would be chosen to balance stability and prevent excessive local divergence. The optimal balance would depend on the specific non-IID level and communication constraints.\\n\\n## 3. Novelty Assessment of FedElasticNet\\n\\nThe concept of Elastic Net regularization is well-established in centralized machine learning, introduced by Zou and Hastie in 2005. Its direct application to the local objective function in Federated Learning, while logical, needs to be assessed relative to existing FL regularization methods.\\n\\n*   **Compared to Existing Regularization-Based FL Methods:**\\n    *   **L2-based (e.g., typical weight decay in optimizers):** Many FL frameworks implicitly or explicitly use L2 regularization (weight decay). FedElasticNet explicitly adds the L1 component, which is a key differentiator for sparsity and feature selection.\\n    *   **Proximal Methods (e.g., FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedAvgM):** These methods introduce a *proximal term* to the local loss function that penalizes the divergence of local model weights from the global model or a control variate. Their primary goal is to explicitly mitigate client drift by keeping local models \"close\" to a reference.\\n        *   **Difference:** FedElasticNet primarily regularizes the *magnitude* and *sparsity* of the weights themselves, rather than their *divergence* from a specific reference model. While both aim for drift robustness, their mechanisms are different. Elastic Net focuses on learning a robust, sparse model inherently, whereas proximal methods actively pull local updates towards a common point.\\n    *   **Sparsification/Pruning Techniques:** Other FL methods focus on communication efficiency through *post-training sparsification* (pruning models after training) or *sparse update quantization* (e.g., Top-K gradient compression, signSGD).\\n        *   **Difference:** FedElasticNet integrates sparsity *during* the training process via L1, rather than as a post-processing step or a gradient compression technique. It inherently learns a sparse representation.\\n\\n*   **Novelty Conclusion:**\\n    *   The *individual components* (L1, L2, FL) are not novel.\\n    *   The novelty lies more in the **explicit proposition and systematic analysis of Elastic Net as a holistic solution** to simultaneously address *both* communication efficiency (via L1-induced sparsity) and drift robustness (via L2-induced stability and L1-induced feature selection) within the standard FL optimization loop.\\n    *   It\\'s less about a groundbreaking new algorithmic primitive for FL (like FedProx\\'s proximal term) and more about a **principled application and evaluation of a powerful, existing regularization technique** in a novel context with a dual objective. Its simplicity of integration into existing FL frameworks is also noteworthy.\\n\\n## 4. Strengths and Weaknesses\\n\\n### Strengths:\\n\\n1.  **Dual Problem Solution:** Addresses two critical FL challenges (communication and non-IID data) within a single, unified regularization framework.\\n2.  **Inherent Sparsity:** L1 regularization encourages sparsity naturally during training, potentially leading to more meaningful feature selection than post-training pruning.\\n3.  **Model Robustness:** L2 regularization enhances model stability and generalization, crucial for heterogeneous FL environments.\\n4.  **Well-Understood Basis:** Elastic Net is a thoroughly researched and understood technique, offering a strong theoretical foundation.\\n5.  **Simplicity of Integration:** It primarily involves modifying the client-side loss function, making it relatively straightforward to integrate into existing FedAvg-like FL systems.\\n6.  **Handles Correlated Features:** The combination of L1 and L2 is particularly effective when features are correlated, offering a more stable feature selection than pure L1.\\n\\n### Weaknesses:\\n\\n1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Complexity:** Adding two new hyperparameters ($\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$) to an already complex distributed system (FL) significantly increases the tuning burden. Finding optimal values can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\\n2.  **Dependency on Sparse Communication:** The full communication efficiency benefits are only realized if the FL system explicitly supports transmitting sparse models/updates. Without this, the sparsity is primarily conceptual.\\n3.  **Potential for Underfitting:** Over-aggressive regularization (too high $\\\\lambda_1$ or $\\\\lambda_2$) can lead to overly simplistic models that underfit the data, especially for complex tasks or highly diverse datasets.\\n4.  **Generalizability to Deep Networks:** While effective for linear/shallow models, applying L1/L2 to *all* parameters of deep neural networks can lead to unstructured sparsity, which is less practical for hardware efficiency than structured sparsity (e.g., entire filters/neurons being zeroed out).\\n5.  **Competition with Specialized Methods:** While addressing both issues, it might not outperform specialized methods (e.g., Top-K for communication, FedProx/SCAFFOLD for drift) when considered in isolation, or when one problem is significantly more dominant.\\n6.  **Non-differentiability of L1:** The L1 norm is not differentiable at zero, which requires using subgradient methods or approximations (e.g., proximal gradient methods), adding slight complexity to the optimization process.\\n\\n## 5. Suggestions for Improving the Regularization Strategy\\n\\n1.  **Adaptive Regularization Schedule:**\\n    *   **Dynamic $\\\\lambda$ Adjustment:** Instead of fixed $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$, explore schedules where these parameters adapt over FL rounds. For instance, gradually increasing $\\\\lambda_1$ over time could encourage more sparsity as the model converges.\\n    *   **Client-Specific Regularization:** Allow $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$ to vary per client based on their data characteristics (e.g., data diversity, size) or their contribution to global model performance. More diverse clients might need higher $\\\\lambda_2$ to prevent drift.\\n\\n2.  **Structured Sparsity Induction:**\\n    *   Instead of just inducing weight-level sparsity, investigate group Lasso or other structured regularization techniques (e.g., L2,1-norm regularization across rows/columns of weight matrices) to enforce sparsity at the neuron, filter, or channel level. This leads to more practical and hardware-friendly pruning, directly translating to smaller models and faster inference.\\n    *   Integrate with existing pruning frameworks (e.g., magnitude pruning, Lottery Ticket Hypothesis) to ensure that the induced sparsity is truly beneficial for deployment.\\n\\n3.  **Explicit Integration with Sparse Communication Protocols:**\\n    *   The framework should explicitly outline how the L1-induced sparsity can be leveraged by existing sparse communication techniques like Top-K sparsification or sparse federated averaging, possibly by setting small weights to exact zeros during local training or before transmission.\\n    *   Consider quantizing the *remaining* non-zero weights for further communication efficiency.\\n\\n4.  **Hybrid Approaches (Combining with Proximal Methods):**\\n    *   Explore combining FedElasticNet with proximal regularization methods (e.g., FedProx). A local loss function could include both the Elastic Net term *and* a proximal term to regularize against divergence from the global model. This could offer a more comprehensive solution for drift robustness.\\n    *   `Local_Loss = Data_Loss + \u03bb1||w||1 + \u03bb2||w||2^2 + \u00b5||w - w_global||2^2`\\n\\n5.  **Layer-wise/Parameter-Group Wise Regularization:**\\n    *   For deep neural networks, different layers or types of parameters might benefit from different regularization strengths. For instance, earlier layers (feature extractors) might benefit more from L1 for robust feature selection, while deeper layers (classifiers) might benefit more from L2 for stability.\\n    *   This requires careful empirical tuning but could yield superior results.\\n\\n6.  **Theoretical Analysis of Convergence and Generalization:**\\n    *   Provide stronger theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence properties of FedElasticNet under non-IID conditions, especially concerning how $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ influence the convergence rate and the quality of the learned global model.\\n    *   Analyze the trade-offs between communication savings and model performance with varying $\\\\lambda$ values.\\n\\n7.  **Benchmarking against State-of-the-Art:**\\n    *   Beyond comparing to FedAvg, rigorously benchmark FedElasticNet against leading methods specifically designed for communication efficiency (e.g., FedPAQ, QSGD) and drift robustness (e.g., FedProx, SCAFFOLD) across diverse datasets and model architectures. This would clearly establish its competitive advantages and limitations.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, FedElasticNet could evolve into a more robust, versatile, and empirically validated framework for federated learning.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.66185215}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='AskAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent has replied to the given prompt', 'output': 'To critically assess the experimental setup for evaluating the robustness of FedElasticNet to heterogeneous datasets, we need to consider how effectively it demonstrates its strengths, identifies its limitations, and provides insights into its mechanisms. Since no specific paper or experimental details are provided, I will outline a comprehensive assessment based on typical best practices and common pitfalls in federated learning research, assuming the paper aims to demonstrate FedElasticNet\\'s advantages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Assessment of Experimental Setup for FedElasticNet Robustness to Heterogeneity\\n\\n**Context:** FedElasticNet aims to leverage the regularization properties of Elastic Net (L1 and L2 penalties) within a federated learning framework, likely to enhance model generalization, prevent client drift, and potentially induce sparsity or robustness in the face of non-IID data.\\n\\n### 1. Strengths of a Well-Designed Experimental Evaluation (Assumed to be Present)\\n\\nA strong experimental setup for FedElasticNet would typically include:\\n\\n*   **Diverse Non-IID Data Distribution Scenarios:**\\n    *   **Label Skew (Quantity-based):** E.g., clients having data from only a subset of classes (e.g., MNIST with 2 digits per client, CIFAR-10 with IID then non-IID splits).\\n    *   **Feature Skew (Distributional Shift):** E.g., using Dirichlet distribution ($\\\\alpha$ parameter) to control the degree of non-IIDness across client data (e.g., $\\\\alpha = 0.1, 1.0, 10.0$).\\n    *   **Quantity Skew:** Clients having vastly different amounts of data.\\n    *   **Pathological Split:** Manually crafting extreme non-IID scenarios (e.g., each client only has data from one class).\\n*   **Comprehensive Baseline Comparison:**\\n    *   **Standard FL Algorithms:** FedAvg, FedProx (for tackling client drift), SCAFFOLD (for variance reduction and drift mitigation), FedNova, MOON, Ditto. The inclusion of *multiple* drift-robust algorithms is crucial for a fair comparison.\\n    *   **Centralized Baseline:** Training on the aggregated dataset (if permissible) to provide an upper bound for performance.\\n*   **Standard and Relevant Datasets:**\\n    *   **Image Classification:** MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, F-MNIST, potentially larger-scale datasets like ImageNet subsets.\\n    *   **NLP/Text:** Subsets of federated datasets like LEAF benchmarks (Sent140, Shakespeare) if applicable to the model type.\\n*   **Appropriate Metrics:**\\n    *   **Test Accuracy/Loss:** On a global test set (unseen by any client during training).\\n    *   **Convergence Speed:** Number of communication rounds to reach a certain performance threshold.\\n    *   **Stability:** Variance of performance across multiple runs.\\n*   **Clear Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy:** Describing how optimal $\\\\lambda_1$ (L1), $\\\\lambda_2$ (L2), learning rates, local epochs, and communication rounds were chosen for FedElasticNet and *all* baselines.\\n*   **Ablation Studies:** To demonstrate the specific contribution of the L1 and L2 regularization components within FedElasticNet (e.g., comparing FedElasticNet with only L1, only L2, and both).\\n*   **Analysis of Model Characteristics:** Examining the weights learned by FedElasticNet (e.g., sparsity induced by L1) and comparing them to baseline models.\\n\\n### 2. Analysis of Performance under Different Non-IID Data Distributions\\n\\nAssuming a well-executed experimental evaluation, the analysis should typically show:\\n\\n*   **Improved Robustness to Non-IIDness:** FedElasticNet should demonstrate higher test accuracy and lower loss compared to basic FedAvg, especially under highly heterogeneous settings (low $\\\\alpha$ values, extreme label skew).\\n*   **Competitive with Drift-Robust Baselines:** It should achieve comparable or superior performance to FedProx, SCAFFOLD, MOON, etc., under various non-IID conditions. The \"sweet spot\" for FedElasticNet would be scenarios where its specific regularization properties (sparsity, weight decay) are particularly beneficial.\\n*   **Graceful Degradation:** As heterogeneity increases (e.g., $\\\\alpha$ decreases significantly), FedElasticNet\\'s performance should degrade more slowly or maintain a higher floor than less robust algorithms.\\n*   **Convergence Behavior:** It might show faster convergence in some scenarios due to better client model alignment, or slower convergence if the regularization is too strong initially.\\n\\n### 3. Evaluation of Effectiveness in Mitigating Client Drift\\n\\nThis is a critical aspect, as Elastic Net regularization can inherently address some aspects of client drift by pushing client models towards a common, potentially sparse or less complex, solution.\\n\\n*   **Indirect Evidence (Performance-based):**\\n    *   **Higher Global Model Performance:** If FedElasticNet consistently outperforms FedAvg under non-IID conditions, it implicitly suggests better aggregation and less client drift.\\n    *   **Reduced Variance across Clients:** If the final local models of clients are more similar to each other (or to the global model) compared to FedAvg, it indicates reduced drift.\\n*   **Direct Evidence (Quantifiable Drift Metrics):**\\n    *   **Distance between Local and Global Models:** Measuring the average L2 norm (or cosine similarity) between client local models and the server\\'s global model *before* local updates, and *after* local updates in each round. A smaller average distance *after* local updates, or slower divergence *during* local training, would indicate better drift mitigation.\\n    *   **Gradient Divergence:** Analyzing the similarity of gradients computed by different clients or the difference between local gradients and the server\\'s aggregated gradient.\\n    *   **Model Divergence over Rounds:** Tracking how individual client models evolve over communication rounds. FedElasticNet should ideally keep them more \"aligned\" than FedAvg.\\n*   **Comparison to Drift-Robust Algorithms:**\\n    *   **Head-to-head performance:** Is FedElasticNet consistently better than FedProx or SCAFFOLD in reducing explicit drift metrics? For instance, FedProx directly regularizes client updates towards the global model. FedElasticNet achieves this through weight regularization. The comparison should clarify which mechanism is more effective in various scenarios.\\n    *   **Mechanistic Insights:** Does Elastic Net achieve drift mitigation by promoting feature selection (L1) or by keeping weights small and stable (L2), thus preventing extreme client-specific adaptations?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement in the Experimental Evaluation\\n\\nAssuming typical limitations often seen in FL research:\\n\\n1.  **Limited Diversity of Heterogeneity Types:** Often, evaluations focus heavily on label skew (Dirichlet) and quantity skew.\\n    *   *Missing:* Concept drift (data distribution changes over time on clients), feature shift (same labels, but input features differ significantly, e.g., different camera types), adversarial heterogeneity (some clients try to poison data).\\n2.  **Insufficient Direct Quantification of Client Drift:** Many papers infer drift mitigation from improved accuracy. Directly measuring and visualizing model divergence (e.g., using t-SNE on model weights, or tracking L2 distances between local and global models) is often overlooked.\\n3.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** While tuning is done, a more robust analysis of how sensitive FedElasticNet\\'s performance is to different $\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2$ values across *various* non-IID settings is crucial. Is there a single robust set of parameters, or does it need re-tuning for each new level of heterogeneity?\\n4.  **Computational and Communication Overhead:**\\n    *   **Communication Cost:** Does Elastic Net regularization affect model size or transmission overhead? (Generally not, unless it\\'s used for dynamic pruning which isn\\'t standard ElasticNet.)\\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Does the regularization add significant computation to local training or server aggregation?\\n5.  **Lack of Deeper Insights into the Mechanism:** While results show \"it works,\" the paper might not delve deep enough into *why* FedElasticNet mitigates drift.\\n    *   Does it lead to more interpretable (sparser) models?\\n    *   Does it implicitly encourage feature sharing across clients?\\n    *   How do the weights of FedElasticNet models differ from FedAvg models on clients?\\n6.  **Scalability Analysis:** How does FedElasticNet perform with a very large number of clients, or with high client participation rates? Does its regularization scheme scale effectively?\\n7.  **Robustness to Other Factors:** How does FedElasticNet perform with client failures, adversarial attacks, or noisy labels (beyond just non-IID)? While not the primary focus, it contributes to overall robustness.\\n8.  **Fairness Metrics:** In highly heterogeneous scenarios, average accuracy might not tell the whole story. Are there clients that perform significantly worse or better? Evaluating fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equality of opportunity) could provide a more nuanced view.\\n9.  **Real-world Complex Scenarios:** Most evaluations stick to standard benchmarks. Testing on more complex, large-scale, and messy real-world federated datasets (e.g., healthcare, financial, IoT) would significantly strengthen the claims.\\n\\n### 5. Specific Suggestions for Improving the Assessment of Robustness to Data Heterogeneity\\n\\n1.  **Expand Non-IID Scenarios:**\\n    *   Include **Concept Shift/Drift**: Simulate situations where the underlying data distribution on a client changes over time, or where different clients learn different \"tasks\" over time.\\n    *   Incorporate **Feature Skew with Different Magnitudes**: Beyond just Dirichlet, use techniques to create domain shifts (e.g., using different pre-processing on client images, or using different sensor data distributions).\\n    *   Test with **Missing Features/Data Imputation**: If applicable, evaluate how FedElasticNet handles clients with incomplete data.\\n\\n2.  **Quantify Client Drift Explicitly:**\\n    *   **Model Divergence Tracking:** For each client $k$ and round $t$, compute $D(w_{k,t}, w_{t}^{global})$, where $w_{k,t}$ is the model *before* local updates and $w_{t}^{global}$ is the global model for that round. Also, track $D(w_{k,t}\\', w_{t}^{global})$ after local updates $w_{k,t}\\'$. Visualize these distances over rounds for different heterogeneity levels and compare to baselines.\\n    *   **Gradient Divergence:** Compare the average cosine similarity or L2 distance of local gradients to the global aggregated gradient across clients.\\n    *   **Visualization of Local Models:** Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE) to visualize the embedding of client model weights over time, showing how clustered or dispersed they are for FedElasticNet versus other methods.\\n\\n3.  **Detailed Hyperparameter Robustness Analysis:**\\n    *   Provide heatmaps or sensitivity plots showing test accuracy (and possibly drift metrics) as a function of $\\\\lambda_1$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ for different levels of non-IIDness. This will inform practitioners on tuning.\\n    *   Discuss the trade-offs: when is more L1 or L2 regularization beneficial, and when does it hurt performance (e.g., too much L1 might make models too simple for complex tasks).\\n\\n4.  **In-depth Analysis of Learned Models:**\\n    *   **Sparsity Analysis (for L1):** Quantify the percentage of zero/near-zero weights in client models and the global model under FedElasticNet, compared to baselines. Does it truly induce sparsity and reduce model complexity?\\n    *   **Feature Importance Analysis:** For simpler models, analyze which features are selected/emphasized by ElasticNet across clients. Does it identify robust common features?\\n    *   **Weight Distribution Histograms:** Visualize the distribution of weights to see if ElasticNet shifts them towards zero or keeps them tighter around common values.\\n\\n5.  **Scalability and Resource Efficiency:**\\n    *   Conduct experiments with a much larger number of clients (e.g., 1000+), varying the number of active clients per round.\\n    *   Measure wall-clock time for training rounds and total training time.\\n    *   Discuss communication payload if the regularization impacts model size.\\n\\n6.  **Fairness Metrics:**\\n    *   Report worst-performing client accuracy, standard deviation of client accuracies, or specific fairness metrics (e.g., average accuracy for clients with minority classes) under severe non-IID conditions.\\n\\n7.  **Comparison to Specific Drift Mitigation Techniques:**\\n    *   Explicitly discuss how FedElasticNet\\'s *implicit* drift mitigation (via regularization) compares to *explicit* techniques like FedProx (proximal term) or SCAFFOLD (control variates) in terms of computational overhead, convergence, and final performance.\\n\\nBy incorporating these detailed considerations and suggestions, the experimental evaluation of FedElasticNet\\'s robustness to heterogeneous datasets would be significantly strengthened, providing a more comprehensive and insightful understanding of its capabilities and limitations.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.66081145}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "function_call", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'FLOE'}, name='FireAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'ROSS'}, name='FireAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=FunctionCall(id=None, args={'agent_name': 'FLHA'}, name='FireAgent'), function_response=None, inline_data=None, text=None)], role='model')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agent successfully fired.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.65791575\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `FireAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"FLOE\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 0, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agent successfully fired.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.65791575\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `FireAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"ROSS\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 1, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tool responded with \n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Agent successfully fired.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.65791575\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `FireAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"FLHA\"\n}\n```\n", "id": 2, "status": "done"}}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Content(parts=[Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='FireAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent successfully fired.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.65791575}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='FireAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent successfully fired.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.65791575}}), inline_data=None, text=None), Part(video_metadata=None, thought=None, code_execution_result=None, executable_code=None, file_data=None, function_call=None, function_response=FunctionResponse(id=None, name='FireAgent', response={'result': {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Agent successfully fired.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.65791575}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reviewer agents have provided comprehensive feedback on the paper.
