The paper title is: Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Multimodal representation learning is an emerging field whose growth is fueled by recent developments in weakly-supervised learning algorithms and by the collection of suitable multimodal datasets. Multimodal data is characterized by the co-occurence of observations from two or more dependent data sources, such as paired images and captions (e.g., Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009; Shi et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2021), and more generally, multimodal observations are comprised of aligned measurements from different types of sensors (Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2019). Co-occurrence is a form of weak supervision (Shu et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020; Chen and Batmanghelich, 2020), in that paired observations can be viewed as proxies (i.e., weak labels) for a shared but unobserved ground truth factor. Among suitable representation learning methods for weakly supervised data, contrastive learning (Gutmann and Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2010; Oord et al., 2018) stands out because it is designed to leverage co-occurring observations from different views. In practice, contrastive learning achieves promising results for multi-view and multimodal learning\u2014a prominent example is the contribution of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) to the groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation (Ramesh et al., 2021; 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022). Despite its empirical success, it is not sufficiently well understood what explains the effectiveness of contrastive learning in practice. Recent works attribute its effectiveness to the recovery of shared latent factors from the underlying causal graph (Gresele et al., 2019; Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021). From the perspective of multi-view independent component analysis, it was shown that contrastive learning can invert a nonlinear mixing function (i.e., a nonlinear generative process) that is applied to a latent variable with mutually independent components (Gresele et al., 2019; Zimmermann et al., 2021). More recently, von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021) show that contrastive learning can recover shared factors up to block-wise indeterminacies, even if there are nontrivial causal and statistical dependencies between latent components. Collectively, these results suggest that contrastive learning can identify parts of an unknown data generating process from pairs of observations alone\u2014even from high-dimensional multi-view observations with nontrivial dependencies. In our work, we investigate the identifiability of shared latent factors in the multimodal setting. We consider a generative process with modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. Our design is motivated by the inherent heterogeneity of multimodal data, which follows naturally when observations are generated by different types of sensors (Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2019). For example, an agent can perceive its environment through distinct sensory modalities, such as cameras sensing light or microphones detecting sound waves. To model information that is shared between modalities, we take inspiration from the multi-view setting (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021) and allow for nontrivial dependencies between latent variables. However, previous work only considers observations of the same data type and assumes that the same input leads to the same output across views. In this work, we introduce a model with distinct generative mechanisms, each of which can exhibit a significant degree of modality-specific variation. This distinction renders the multimodal setting more general compared to the multi-view setting considered by previous work. In a nutshell, our work is concerned with identifiability for multimodal representation learning and focuses on contrastive learning as a particular algorithm for which we derive identifiability results. In Section 2, we cover relevant background on both topics, identifiability and contrastive learning. We then formalize the multimodal generative process as a latent variable model (Section 3) and prove that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between modalities (Section 4). We empirically verify the identifiability results with fully controlled numerical simulations (Section 5.1) and corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs (Section 5.2). Finally, we contextualize related literature (Section 6) and discuss potential limitations and opportunities for future work (Section 7). 2 PRELIMINARIES:  2.1 IDENTIFIABILITY: Identifiability lies at the heart of many problems in the fields of independent component analysis (ICA), causal discovery, and inverse problems, among others (Lehmann and Casella, 2006). From the perspective of ICA, we consider the relation x = f(z), where an observation x is generated from a mixing function f that is applied to a latent variable z. The goal of ICA is to invert the mixing function in order to recover the latent variable from observations alone. In many settings, full identifiability is impossible and certain ambiguities might be acceptable. For example, identifiability might hold for a subset of components (i.e., partial identifiability). Typical ambiguities include permutation and element-wise transformations (i.e., component-wise indeterminacy), or identifiability up to groups of latent variables (i.e., block-wise indeterminacy). In the general case, when f is a nonlinear function, a landmark negative result states that the recovery of the latent variable given i.i.d. observations is fundamentally impossible (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen, 1999). However, a recent line of pioneering works provides identifiability results for the difficult nonlinear case under additional assumptions, such as auxiliary variables (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Morioka, 2017; Hyv\u00e4rinen et al., 2019; Khemakhem et al., 2020) or multiple views (Gresele et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021). Most relevant to our investigation are previous works related to multi-view nonlinear ICA (Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020; Locatello et al., 2020; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021). Generally, this line of work considers the following generative process: z \u223c pz, x1 = f1(z), x2 = f2(z), (1) where a latent variable, or a subset of its components, is shared between pairs of observations (x1,x2) \u223c px1,x2 , where the two views x1 and x2 are generated by two nonlinear mixing functions, f1 and f2 respectively. Intuitively, a second view can resolve ambiguity introduced by the nonlinear mixing, if both views contain a shared signal but are otherwise sufficiently distinct (Gresele et al., 2019). Previous works differ in their assumptions on the mixing functions and dependence relations between latent components. The majority of previous work (Song et al., 2014; Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) considers mutually independent latent components, and some of these works (Song et al., 2014; Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020) consider view-specific1 mixing functions. Venturing beyond the strict assumption of independent components, von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021) consider additional causal and statistical dependencies between latent components and show that the subset of shared components can be identified up to a block-wise indeterminacy. Our work considers heterogeneous modalities with causal and statistical dependencies between latents. We prove that shared factors can be block-identified in a novel setting with modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. 2.2 CONTRASTIVE LEARNING: Contrastive learning (Gutmann and Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2010; Oord et al., 2018) is a self-supervised representation learning method that leverages weak supervision in the form of paired observations. On a high level, the method learns to distinguish \u201cpositive\u201d pairs of encodings sampled from the joint distribution, against \u201cnegative\u201d pairs sampled from the product of marginals. The popular InfoNCE objective (Oord et al., 2018) is defined as follows: LInfoNCE(g1,g2) = E{xi1,xi2}Ki=1\u223cpx1,x2 [ \u2212 K\u2211 i=1 log exp{sim(g1(xi1),g2(xi2))/\u03c4}\u2211K j=1 exp{sim(g1(xi1),g2(x j 2))/\u03c4} ] , (2) where g1 and g2 are encoders for the first and second view, x1 and x2 respectively. It is common to use a single encoder g1 = g2 when x2 is an augmented version of x1 or when two augmentations are sampled from the same distribution to transform x1 and x2 respectively (e.g., Chen et al., 2020). The set of hyperparameters consists of the temperature \u03c4 , a similarity metric sim(\u00b7, \u00b7), and an integer K that controls the number of negative pairs (K \u2212 1) used for contrasting. The objective has an information-theoretic interpretation as a variational lower bound on the mutual information I(g1(x1);g2(x2)) (Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019) and it can also be interpreted as the alignment of positive pairs (numerator) with additional entropy regularization (denominator), where the regularizer disincentivizes a degenerate solution in which both encoders map to a constant (Wang and Isola, 2020). Formally, when instantiating the LInfoNCE objective with \u03c4 = 1 and sim(a, b) = \u2212(a\u2212 b)2, it asymptotically behaves like LAlignMaxEnt(g) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g(x1)\u2212 g(x2)\u22252]\u2212H(g(x)) (3) for a single encoder g, when K \u2192 \u221e (Wang and Isola, 2020; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021). In the setting with two heterogeneous modalities, it is natural to employ separate encoders g1 \u0338= g2, which can represent different architectures. Further, it is common to use a symmetrized version of the objective (e.g., see Zhang et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021), which can be obtained by computing the mean of the loss in both directions: LSymInfoNCE(g1,g2) = 1/2LInfoNCE(g1,g2) + 1/2LInfoNCE(g2,g1). (4) Akin to Equation (3), we can approximate the symmetrized objective for \u03c4 = 1 and sim(a, b) = \u2212(a\u2212 b)2, with a large number of negative samples (K \u2192 \u221e), as follows: LSymAlignMaxEnt(g1,g2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g1(x1)\u2212 g2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g1(x1)) +H(g2(x2))) . (5) Since the similarity measure is symmetric, the approximation of the alignment term is identical for both LInfoNCE(g1,g2) and LInfoNCE(g2,g1). Each entropy term is approximated via the denominator of the respective loss term, which can be viewed as a nonparametric entropy estimator (Wang and Isola, 2020). For our experiments, we employ the finite-sample estimators LInfoNCE and LSymInfoNCE, while for our theoretical analysis we use the estimand LSymAlignMaxEnt to derive identifiability results. 3 GENERATIVE PROCESS: In the following, we formulate the multimodal generative process as a latent variable model (Section 3.1) and then specify our technical assumptions on the relation between modalities (Section 3.2). 1Note that we define modality-specific functions similar to the way Gresele et al. (2019) and Lyu and Fu (2020) define view-specific functions. To clarify the distinction, we generally assume that observations from different modalities are generated by distinct mechanisms f1 \u0338= f2 with modality-specific latent variables, and we treat the multi-view setting as a special case, where f1 = f2 without view-specific latent variables. 3.1 LATENT VARIABLE MODEL: On a high level, we assume that there exists a continuous random variable z that takes values in the latent space Z \u2286 Rn, which contains all information to generate observations of both modalities.2 Moreover, we assume that z = (c, s,m1,m2) can be uniquely partitioned into four disjoint parts: (i) an invariant part c which is always shared across modalities, and which we refer to as content; (ii) a variable part s which may change across modalities, and which we refer to as style; (iii) two modality-specific parts, m1 and m2, each of which is unique to the respective modality. Let z1 = (c, s,m1) and z2 = (c\u0303, s\u0303,m2), where c\u0303 = c almost everywhere and s\u0303 is generated by perturbations that are specified in Section 3.2. Akin to multi-view ICA (Equation 1), we define the generative process for modalities x1 and x2 as follows: z \u223c pz, x1 = f1(z1), x2 = f2(z2), (6) where f1 : Z1 \u2192 X1 and f2 : Z2 \u2192 X2 are two smooth and invertible mixing functions with smooth inverse (i.e., diffeomorphisms) that generate observations x1 and x2 taking values in X1 \u2286 Rd1 and X2 \u2286 Rd2 respectively. Generally, we assume that observations from different modalities are generated by distinct mechanisms f1 \u0338= f2 that take modality-specific latent variables as input. As for the multi-view setting (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021), the considered generative process goes beyond the classical ICA setting by allowing for statistical dependencies within blocks of variables (e.g., between dimensions of c) and also for causal dependencies from content to style, as illustrated in Figure 1. The outlined generative process is fairly general and it applies to a wide variety of practical settings. The content invariance describes a shared phenomenon that is not directly observed but manifests in the observations from both modalities. Style changes describe shared influences that are not robust across modalities, e.g., non-invertible transformations such as data augmentations, or nondeterministic effects of an unobserved confounder. Modality-specific factors can be viewed as variables that describe the inherent heterogeneity of each modality (e.g., background noise). 3.2 RELATION BETWEEN MODALITIES: Next, we specify our assumptions on the relation between modalities by defining the conditional distribution pz2|z1 , which describes the relation between latent variables z1 and z2, from which observations x1 and x2 are generated via Equation (6). Similar to previous work in the multi-view setting (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021), we assume that content is invariant, i.e., c\u0303 = c almost everywhere (Assumption 1), and that s\u0303 is a perturbed version of s (Assumption 2). To state our assumptions for the multimodal setting, we also need to consider the modality-specific latent variables. 2Put differently, we assume that all observations lie on a continuous manifold, which can have much smaller dimensionality than the observation space of the respective modality. Assumption 1 (Content-invariance). The conditional density pz2|z1 over Z2 \u00d7Z1 takes the form pz2|z1(z2|z1) = \u03b4(c\u0303\u2212 c)ps\u0303|s(\u0303s|s)pm2(m2) (7) for some continuous density ps\u0303|s on S \u00d7 S , where \u03b4(\u00b7) is the Dirac delta function, i.e., c\u0303 = c a.e. To fully specify pz2|z1 , it remains to define the style changes, which are described by the conditional distribution ps\u0303|s. There are several justifications for modeling such a stochastic relation between s and s\u0303 (Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021); one could either consider s\u0303 to be a noisy version of s, or consider s\u0303 to be the result of an augmentation that induces a soft intervention on s.3 Assumption 2 (Style changes). Let A be the powerset of style variables {1, . . . , ns} and let pA be a distribution on A. Then the style conditional ps\u0303|s is obtained via conditioning on a set A \u223c pA: ps\u0303|s,A(\u0303s|s, A) = \u03b4(\u0303sAc \u2212 sAc)ps\u0303A|sA (\u0303sA|sA) (8) where ps\u0303A|sA is a continuous density on SA \u00d7 SA, SA \u2286 S denotes the subspace of changing style variables specified by A, and Ac = {1, . . . , ns}\\A denotes the complement of A. Further, for any style variable l \u2208 {1, . . . , ns}, there exists a set A \u2286 {1, . . . , ns} with l \u2208 A, s.t. (i) pA(A) > 0, (ii) ps\u0303A|sA is smooth w.r.t. both s\u0303A, and (iii) for any sA, ps\u0303A|sA(\u00b7|sA) > 0, in some open non-empty subset containing sA. Intuitively, to generate a pair of observations (x1,x2), we independently flip a biased coin for each style dimension to select a subset of style features A \u2286 {1, . . . , ns}, which are jointly perturbed to obtain s\u0303. Condition (i) ensures that every style dimension has a positive probability to be perturbed, while (ii) and (iii) are technical smoothness conditions that will be used for the proof of Theorem 1. Summarizing, in this section we have formalized the multimodal generative process as a latent variable model (Section 3.1) and specified our assumptions on the relation between modalities via the conditional distribution pz1|z2 (Section 3.2). Next, we segue into the topic of representation learning and show that, for the specified generative process, multimodal contrastive learning can identify the content factors up to a block-wise indeterminacy. 4 IDENTIFIABILITY RESULTS: First, we need to define block-identifiability (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021) for the multimodal setting in which we consider modality-specific mixing functions and encoders. In the following, nc denotes the number of content variables and the subscript 1:nc denotes the subset of content dimensions (indexed from 1 to nc w.l.o.g.). Definition 1 (Block-identifiability). The true content partition c = f\u221211 (x1)1:nc = f \u22121 2 (x2)1:nc is block-identified by a function gi : Xi \u2192 Zi, with i \u2208 {1, 2}, if the inferred content partition c\u0302i = gi(xi)1:nc contains all and only information about c, i.e., if there exists an invertible function hi : Rnc \u2192 Rnc s.t. c\u0302i = hi(c). It is important to note that block-identifiability does not require the identification of individual factors, which is the goal of multi-view nonlinear ICA (Gresele et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021; Klindt et al., 2021) and the basis for strict definitions of disentanglement (Bengio et al., 2013; Higgins et al., 2018; Shu et al., 2020). Instead, our goal is to isolate the group of invariant factors (i.e., the content partition) from the remaining factors of variation in the data. Specifically, our goal is to show that contrastive learning can block-identify the content variables for the multimodal setting described in Section 3. We formalize this in Theorem 1 and thereby relax the assumptions from previous work by allowing for distinct generating mechanisms f1 \u0338= f2 and additional modality-specific latent variables. 3Note that the asymmetry between z1 and z2 (or between s and s\u0303) is not strictly required. We chose to write z2 as a perturbation of z1 to simplify the notation and for consistency with previous work. Instead, we could model both z1 and z2 via pertubarbations of z, as described in Appendix A.2. Theorem 1. Assume the data generating process described in Sec. 3.1, i.e. data pairs (x1,x2) generated from Equation (6) with pz1 = pz\\{m2} and pz2|z1 as defined in Assumptions 1 and 2. Further, assume that pz is a smooth and continuous density on Z with pz(z) > 0 almost everywhere. Let g1 : X1 \u2192 (0, 1)nc and g2 : X2 \u2192 (0, 1)nc be smooth functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt as defined in Eq. (5). Then, g1 and g2 block-identify the true content variables in the sense of Def. 1. A proof of Theorem 1 is provided in Appendix A.1. Intuitively, the result states that contrastive learning can identify the content variables up to a block-wise indeterminacy. Similar to previous work, the result is based on the optimization of the asymptotic form of the contrastive loss (Equation 4). Moreover, Theorem 1 assumes that the number of content variables is known or that it can be estimated (e.g., with a heuristic like the elbow method). We address the question of selecting the encoding size with dimensionality ablations throughout our experiments. In Section 7, we will return to the discussion of the assumptions in the context of the experimental results. 5 EXPERIMENTS: The goal of our experiments is to test whether contrastive learning can block-identify content in the multimodal setting, as described by Theorem 1. First, we verify identifiability in a fully controlled setting with numerical simulations (Section 5.1). Second, we corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs (Section 5.2). 5.1 NUMERICAL SIMULATION: We extend the numerical simulation from von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021) and implement the multimodal setting using modality-specific mixing functions (f1 \u0338= f2) with modality-specific latent variables. The numerical simulation allows us to measure identifiability with full control over the generative process. The data generation is consistent with the generative process described in Section 3. We sample c \u223c N (0,\u03a3c), mi \u223c N (0,\u03a3mi), and s \u223c N (a + Bc,\u03a3s). Statistical dependencies within blocks (e.g., among components of c) are induced by non-zero off-diagonal entries in the corresponding covariance matrix (e.g. in \u03a3c). The causal dependence between content and style variables can be controlled via B. For style changes, Gaussian noise is added with probability \u03c0 independently for each style dimension: s\u0303i = si + \u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223c N (0,\u03a3\u03f5) with probability \u03c0. We generate the observations x1 = f1(c, s,m1) and x2 = f2(c, s\u0303,m2) using two distinct nonlinear mixing functions, i.e, for each i \u2208 {1, 2}, f i : Rd \u2192 Rd is a separate, invertible 3-layer MLP with LeakyReLU(\u03b1 = 0.2) activations. We train the encoders for 200,000 iterations using the symmetrized InfoNCE objective (Equation 4) and the hyperparameters listed in Appendix B.2. We evaluate block-identifiability by predicting the ground truth factors from the learned representation using kernel ridge regression and report the R2 coefficient of determination on holdout data. Results We compare the original setting (f1 = f2, Table 1a) with the multimodal setting (f1 \u0338= f2, Table 1b) and find that content can be block-identified in both settings, as the R2 score is close to one for the prediction of content, and quasi-random for the prediction of style and modality-specific information. Consistent with previous work, we observe that some style information can be predicted when there are statistical and/or causal dependencies; this is expected because statistical dependencies decrease the effective dimensionality of content, while the causal dependence c \u2192 s makes style partially predictable from the encoded content information. Overall, the results of the numerical simulation are consistent with our theoretical result from Theorem 1, showing that contrastive learning can block-identify content in the multimodal setting. 5.2 IMAGE/TEXT PAIRS: Next, we test whether block-identifiability holds in a more realistic setting with image/text pairs\u2014two complex modalities with distinct generating mechanisms. We extend the Causal3DIdent dataset (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2021), which allows us to measure and control the ground truth latent factors used to generate complex observations. We use Blender (Blender Online Community, 2018) to render high-dimensional images that depict a scene with a colored object illuminated by a differently colored spotlight and positioned in front of a colored background. The scene is defined by 11 latent factors: the shape of the object (7 classes), position of the object (x, y, z coordinates), orientation of the object (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 angles), position of the spotlight (\u03b8 angle), as well as the color of the object, background, and spotlight respectively (one numerical value for each). Multimodal3DIdent We extend the Causal3DIdent dataset to the multimodal setting as follows. We generate textual descriptions from the latent factors by adapting the text rendering from the CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2017). Each image/text pair shares information about the shape of the object (cow, teapot, etc.) and its position in the scene (e.g., bottom-right). For each position factor, we use three clearly discernable values (top/center/bottom; left/center/right), which can be described in text more naturally than coordinates. While shape and position are always shared (i.e., content) between the paired image and text, the color of the object is causally influenced by position (cf. Appendix B.1) and is stochastically shared (i.e., style). For the object color, we use a continuous hue value, whereas for the text we match the RGB value with the nearest value from a given palette (i.e., a list of named colors, such as brown, beige, olive, etc.). The color palette is randomly sampled from a set of three palettes4 to ensure the object color depicted in the image does not uniquely determine the color described in the text. As modality-specific factors for the images, we have object rotation, spotlight position, and background color, while for the textual descriptions, we follow Johnson et al. (2017) and use 5 different types of phrases to introduce modality-specific variation. Examples of image/text pairs are shown in Figure 2. We train the encoders for 100,000 iterations using the symmetrized InfoNCE objective (Equation 4) and the hyperparameters listed in Appendix B.2. For the image encoder we use a ResNet-18 architecture (He et al., 2016) and for the text we use 1D convolutions. As for the numerical simulation, we evaluate block-identifiability by predicting the ground truth factors from the learned representation. For continuous factors, we use kernel ridge regression and report the R2 score, whereas for discrete factors we report the classification accuracy of an MLP with a single hidden layer. Results Figure 3 presents the results on Multimodal3DIdent with a dimensionality ablation, where we vary the size of the encoding of the model. Content factors (object position and shape) are always encoded well, unless the encoding size is too small (i.e. smaller than four). When there is sufficient capacity, style information (object color) is also encoded, partly because there is a causal dependence from content to style and partly because of the excess capacity, as already observed in previous work. Image-specific information (object rotation, spotlight position, background color) is mostly discarded, independent of the encoding size. Text-specific information (phrasing) is encoded to a moderate degree (48\u201380% accuracy), which we attribute to the fact that phrasing is a discrete factor that violates the assumption of continuous latents. This hints at possible limitations in the presence 4 We use the following three palettes from the matplotlib.colors API: Tableau colors (10 values), CSS4 colors (148 values), and XKCD colors (949 values). of discrete latent factors, which we further investigate in Appendix B.2 and discuss in Section 7. Overall, our results suggest that contrastive learning can block-identify content factors in a complex multimodal setting with image/text pairs. 6 RELATED WORK: Multi-view nonlinear ICA The goal of multi-view nonlinear ICA is to identify latent factors shared between different views, as described in Section 2.1. There is a thread of works (Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) that recover the latent variable up to a component-wise indeterminacy in a setting with mutually independent latent components. Beyond the classical assumption of independent components, there is a line of works (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2022) that partition the latent space into blocks of invariant and blocks of changing components and show that the invariant components can be identified up to a block-wise indeterminacy, even when there are nontrivial dependencies between latent components. Our work advances in this direction and considers heterogenous modalities with nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies between latents. We prove that shared factors can be block-identified in a novel setting with modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. Multimodal representation learning Multimodal representation learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources into a joint representation (Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019). There is a myriad of methods designed to learn representations of multimodal data either directly or indirectly. Among methods that learn representations indirectly, there are multimodal autoencoders (Ngiam et al., 2011; Geng et al., 2022; Bachmann et al., 2022; Aghajanyan et al., 2022) and a large variety of multimodal generative models (e.g., Suzuki et al., 2016; Wu and Goodman, 2018; Shi et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2019; Ramesh et al., 2021) that learn representations by backpropagation of different forms of reconstruction and/or masked prediction error. A more direct approach is taken by decoder-free methods that maximize the similarity between the encodings of different modalities. This class of methods includes nonlinear canonical correlation analysis (Akaho, 2001; Bach and Jordan, 2002; Andrew et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Karami and Schuurmans, 2021) as well as multi-view and multimodal contrastive learning (Tian et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2021; Federici et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021; Poklukar et al., 2022). While all of the named methods aim to integrate information across modalities, they do not answer the underlying question of identifiability, which our work seeks to address. 7 DISCUSSION: Implications and scope We have shown that contrastive learning can block-identify shared factors in the multimodal setting. Numerical simulations (Section 5.1) verify our main theoretical result (Theorem 1), showing that contrastive learning encodes all and only content information (Definition 1), when the size of the encoding matches the number of content factors. Experiments on a complex dataset of image/text pairs corroborate that contrastive learning can isolate content in a more realistic setting and even under some violations of the assumptions underlying Theorem 1. More generally, we observe that contrastive learning encodes invariant information (i.e., content) very well across all settings. When there is sufficient capacity, stochastically shared information (i.e., style) is encoded to a moderate degree, but without affecting the prediction of invariant information. For practice, our results suggests that contrastive learning without capacity constraints can encode any shared factor, irregardless of whether the factor is truly invariant across modalities or if its effect on the observations is confounded by noise or other factors. This is in line with the information-theoretic view (Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019), i.e., that contrastive learning maximizes the mutual information between representations\u2014a measure of mutual dependence that quantifies any information that is shared. Our results demonstrate that the size of the encoding can be reduced to encode all and only invariant information, as captured by the notion of block-identifiability. In practice, this can be leveraged for representation learning in settings of content-preserving distribution shifts (Mitrovic et al., 2021; Federici et al., 2021), where information relevant for a downstream task remains unchanged. Limitations and outlook First, Theorem 1 assumes that only invariant factors can be blockidentified. However, in practice, there can be pairs of observations for which the invariance is inadvertently violated, e.g., due to measurement errors, occlusions, or other mistakes in the data collection. On the one hand, such a violation can be viewed as a mere artifact of the data collection and could be managed via interventions on the generative process, e.g., actions in reinforcement learning (Lippe et al., 2022; Brehmer et al., 2022; Ahuja et al., 2022). On the other hand, violations of the content-invariance blur the line between content and style factors and it would be interesting to study identifiability in a more general setting with only stochastically shared factors. Second, Theorem 1 assumes that the number of content factors is known or that it can be estimated. In practice, this might not be a significant limitation, since the number of content factors can be viewed as a single hyperparameter (e.g., Locatello et al., 2020), though the design of suitable heuristics is an interesting research direction. Third, Theorem 1 assumes that all latent factors are continuous. While this assumption prevails in related work (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen, 1999; Hyvarinen and Morioka, 2016; Hyv\u00e4rinen et al., 2019; Gresele et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2019; 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Klindt et al., 2021), our results in Figure 3b indicate that in the presence of discrete factors some style or modality-specific information can be encoded. In Appendix B.2, we provide a simple numerical simulation that supports these findings. Finally, our model can be extended to more than two modalities\u2014a setting for which there are intriguing identifiability results (Gresele et al., 2019; Sch\u00f6lkopf et al., 2016). Summarizing, the described limitations mirror the assumptions of the generative process (Section 3), which may be relaxed in future work. 8 CONCLUSION: We addressed the problem of identifiability for multimodal representation learning and showed that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between heterogenous modalities. We formalize the multimodal generative process as a novel latent variable model with modality-specific generative mechanisms and nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies between latents. We prove that contrastive learning can identify shared latent factors up to a block-wise indeterminacy and therefore isolate invariances between modalities from other changeable factors. Our theoretical results are corroborated by numerical simulations and on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs. More generally, we believe that our work will help in shaping a theoretical foundation for multimodal representation learning and that further relaxations of the presented generative process offer rich opportunities for future work. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT For our theoretical statements, we provide detailed derivations and state the necessary assumptions. The generative process is specified in Section 3 and the assumptions for block-identifiability are referenced in Theorem 1. We test violations of the key assumptions with suitable experiments (dimensionality ablation, discrete latent factors) and discuss the limitations of our work in Section 7. Further, we empirically verify our theoretical results with numerical simulations and on complex multimodal data. To ensure empirical reproducibility, the results of every experiment were averaged over multiple seeds and are reported with standard deviations. Information about implementation details, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics are included in Appendix B.1. In the supplementary material, we provide the code to reproduce the experiments. A THEORY: A.1 PROOF OF THEOREM 1 Theorem 1. Assume the data generating process described in Sec. 3.1, i.e. data pairs (x1,x2) generated from Equation (6) with pz1 = pz\\{m2} and pz2|z1 as defined in Assumptions 1 and 2. Further, assume that pz is a smooth and continuous density on Z with pz(z) > 0 almost everywhere. Let g1 : X1 \u2192 (0, 1)nc and g2 : X2 \u2192 (0, 1)nc be smooth functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt as defined in Eq. (5). Then, g1 and g2 block-identify the true content variables in the sense of Def. 1. Proof. To prove Theorem 1, we follow the proof structure from von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021, Theorem 4.4) and divide the proof into three steps. First, we show that there exists a pair of smooth functions g\u22171,g \u2217 2 that attain the global minimum of LSymAlignMaxEnt (Eq. 5). Further, in Equations (13\u2013 15), we derive invariance conditions that have to hold almost surely for any pair of smooth functions g1,g2 attaining the global minimum of Eq. (5). In Step 2, we use the invariance conditions derived in Step 1 to show by contradiction that any pair of smooth functions g1,g2 that attain the global minimum in Eq. (5) can only depend on content and not on style or modality-specific information. In the third and final step, for h1 := g1 \u25e6 f1 and h2 := g2 \u25e6 f2, we show that both functions must be bijections and hence that c is block-identified by g1 and g2 respectively. Step 1. Recall the asymptotic form of the objective, as defined in Equation (5): LSymAlignMaxEnt(g1,g2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g1(x1)\u2212 g2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g1(x1)) +H(g2(x2))) . (5) The global minimum of LSymAlignMaxEnt is reached when the first term is minimized and the second term is maximized. The first term is minimized when the encoders g1 and g2 are perfectly aligned, i.e., when g1(x1) = g2(x2) holds for all pairs (x1,x2) \u223c px1,x2 . The second term attains its maximum when g1 and g2 map to a uniformly distributed random variable on (0, 1) nc respectively.5 To show that there exists a pair of functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt, let g\u22171 := d1 \u25e6 f \u22121 1,1:nc and let g\u22172 := d2 \u25e6 f \u22121 2,1:nc , where the subscript 1:nc indexes the subset of content dimensions w.l.o.g. and where d1 and d2 will be defined using the Darmois construction (Darmois, 1951; Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen, 1999). First, recall that f\u221211 (x1)1:nc = c and that f \u22121 2 (x2)1:nc = c\u0303 by definition. Second, for i \u2208 {1, 2}, let us define di : C 7\u2192 (0, 1)nc using the Darmois construction, such that di maps c and c\u0303 to a uniform random variable respectively. It follows that g\u22171,g \u2217 2 are smooth functions, because any function di obtained via the Darmois construction is smooth and f\u221211 , f \u22121 2 are smooth as well (each being the inverse of a smooth function). Next, we show that the pair of functions g\u22171,g \u2217 2, as defined above, attains the global minimum of the objective LSymAlignMaxEnt. We have that LSymAlignMaxEnt(g\u22171,g \u2217 2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g \u2217 1(x1)\u2212 g \u2217 2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g \u2217 1(x1)) +H(g \u2217 2(x2))) (9) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225d1(c)\u2212 d2(c\u0303)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(d1(c)) +H(d2(c\u0303))) (10) = 0 (11) where by Assumption 1, c = c\u0303 almost surely, which implies that the first term is zero almost surely. Further, di maps c, c\u0303 to uniformly distributed random variables on (0, 1)nc , which implies that the differential entropy of d1(c) and d2(c\u0303) is zero, as well. Consequently, there exists a pair of functions g\u22171,g \u2217 2 that minimizes LSymAlignMaxEnt. Next, let g1 : X1 7\u2192 (0, 1)nc and g2 : X2 7\u2192 (0, 1)nc be any pair of smooth functions that attains the global minimum of Eq. (5), i.e., LSymAlignMaxEnt(g1,g2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g1(x1)\u2212 g2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g1(x1)) +H(g2(x2))) = 0 . (12) Let h1 := g1 \u25e6 f1 and h2 := g2 \u25e6 f2, and notice that both are smooth functions since all involved functions are smooth by definition. Since Equation (12) is a global minimum, it implies the following 5Note that we restrict the range of g1 and g2 to (0, 1) nc by definition merely to simplify the notation. Generally, the uniform distribution U(a, b) is the maximum entropy distribution on the interval [a, b]. invariance conditions for the individual terms: E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225h1(z1)\u2212 h2(z2)\u22252] = 0 (13) H(h1(z2)) = 0 (14) H(h2(z2)) = 0 (15) Hence, h1(z1) = h2(z2) must hold almost surely w.r.t. px1,x2 . Additionally, Equation (14) (resp. Equation (15)) implies that c\u03021 = h1(z1) (resp. c\u03022 = h2(z2)) must be uniform on (0, 1)nc . Step 2. Next, we show that any pair of functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt depend only on content information. Since style is independent of m1 and m2, we first show that h1(z1) does not depend on m1, and that h2(z2) does not depend on m2. We then show that h1 and h2 also cannot depend on style, based on a result from previous work. First note, that we can exclude all degenerate solutions where g1 maps a component of m1 to a constant, since g1 would not be invertible anymore and such a solution would violate the invariance in Eq. (14). To prove a contradiction, suppose that, w.l.o.g., h1(c, s,m1)1:nc := h1(z1)1:nc depends on some component in m1. By Assumption 1, z2 is independent of m1 and hence |(h1(z1)1:nc \u2212 h2(z2)1:nc)| > 0 (16) holds almost surely if h1(z1)1:nc depends on any component of m1, which violates the invariance in Equation (13). Thus, h1(z1)1:nc cannot depend on any component of m1. Having established that neither h1(z1)1:nc , nor h2(z2)1:nc can depend on modality-specific information, it remains to show that style information is not encoded, as well. Leveraging Assumption 2, we can show that the strict inequality in Equation (13) has a positve density if h1(z1)1:nc or h2(z2)1:nc was dependent on a dimension in s respectively s\u0303, which would again lead to a violation of the invariance derived in Equation (13), as shown in von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021, Proof of Theorem 4.2). Step 3. It remains to show that h1,h2 are bijections. We know that C and (0, 1)nc are simply connected and oriented C1 manifolds, and we have established in Step 1 that h1 and h2 are smooth and hence differentiable functions. Since pc is a regular density, the uniform distributions w.r.t. the pushthrough functions h1 and h2 are regular densities. Thus, h1 and h2 are bijections (Zimmermann et al., 2021, Proposition 5) Step 3 concludes the proof. We have shown that for any pair of smooth functions g1,g2 that attain the global minimum of Eq. (5), we have that c is block-identified (Def. 1) by g1 and g2. A.2 SYMMETRIC GENERATIVE PROCESS Throughout the main body of the paper, we described an asymmetric generating mechanism, where z2 is a perturbed version of z1. Here, we will briefly sketch out how our model and results can be adapted to a symmetric setting, where both z1 and z2 are generated as perturbations of z. Concretely, we would need to make small adjustments to Assumptions 1 and 2 as follows. We start with the content invariance in Assumption 1, which specifies how z1 = (c\u03031, s\u03031, m\u03031) and z2 = (c\u03032, s\u03032, m\u03032) are generated. Let i \u2208 {1, 2}. The conditional density pzi|z over Zi \u00d7Z takes the form pzi|z(zi|z) = \u03b4(c\u0303i \u2212 c)\u03b4(m\u0303i \u2212mi)ps\u0303i|s(\u0303si|s) , (17) where \u03b4(\u00b7) is the Dirac delta function, i.e., c\u0303i = c almost everywhere, as well as m\u0303i = mi almost everywhere. Note that since c\u03031 = c a.e. and c = c\u03032 a.e., it follows that c\u03031 = c\u03032 almost everywhere, which is a property that is needed in Step 1 in the proof of Theorem 1. In addition, it still holds that m\u0303i \u22a5\u22a5 zj , for i, j \u2208 {1, 2} and i \u0338= j, which is needed in Step 2 of the proof to show that modality-specific information is not encoded. Lastly, we need to revisit Assumption 2, for which both s\u03031 and s\u03032 would be generated through perturbations of s via the conditional distribution ps\u0303i|s on S \u00d7 S, as described in Assumption 2, for each i individually. As a small technical nuance, we would need to specify the conditional generation of the perturbed style variables s\u03031 and s\u03032 such that they are not perturbed in an identical manner w.r.t. s. This can be ensured by, e.g., constraining pA appropriately to exclude the degenerate case where dimensions in s\u03031 and s\u03032 are perfectly aligned\u2014a case that needs to be excluded for Step 2 of the proof of Theorem 1. B EXPERIMENTS: B.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Numerical simulation The generative process is described in Section 5.1. Here, we provide additional information about the experiment. The invertible MLP is constructed similar to previous work (Hyvarinen and Morioka, 2016; Hyv\u00e4rinen and Morioka, 2017; Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021) by resampling square weight matrices until their condition number surpasses a threshold value. For the original setting (f1 = f2), we use one encoder (g1 = g2), whereas for the multimodal setting (f1 \u0338= f2), we use distinct encoders (g1 \u0338= g2) to mirror the assumption of distinct mixing functions and because, in practice, the dimensionality of the observations can differ across modalities. Multimodal3DIdent Our dataset of image/text pairs is based on the code used to generate the Causal3DIdent (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2021) and CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) datasets. Images are generated using the Blender renderer (Blender Online Community, 2018). The rendering serves as a complex mixing function that generates the images from 11 different parameters (i.e., latent factors) that are listed in Table 3. To generate textual descriptions, we adapt the text rendering from CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) and use 5 different phrases to induce modality-specific variation. The latent factors used to generate the text are also listed in Table 3. The dependence between the image and text modality is determined by three content factors (object shape, x-position, and y-position) and one style factor (object color). For the object color in the image, we use a continuous hue value, whereas for the text we match the RGB value with the nearest color value from one of three different palettes4 that is sampled uniformly at random for each observation. Further, we ensure that there are no overlapping color values across palettes by using a prefix for the respective palette (e.g., \u201cxkcd:black\u201d) when necessary. In Section 5.2, we use a version of the Multimodal3DIdent dataset with a causal dependence from content to style. Specifically, the color of the object depends on its x-position. In particular, we split the range of hue values [0, 2\u03c0] into three equally sized intervals and associate each of these intervals with a fixed x-position of the object. For instance, if x-position is \u201cleft\u201d, we sample the hue value from the interval [0, 2/3\u03c0]. Consequently, the color of the object can be predicted to some degree from the position of the object. Samples of image/text pairs from the Multimodal3DIdent dataset are shown in Figures 2 and 4. The hyperparameters for the experiment are listed in Table 2b. B.2 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Numerical simulation without modality-specific latents Recall that the considered generative process (Section 3) has two sources of modality-specific variation: modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. To decouple the effect of these two sources of variation, we conduct an ablation study without modality-specific latent variables. Table 4 presents the results, showing that content is block-identified in both the original setting (f1 = f2, Table 4a) and the multimodal setting (f1 \u0338= f2, Table 4b). Compared to Table 1, we observe that the content prediction is improved slightly in the case without modality-specific latent variables. Hence, our results suggest that contrastive learning can block-identify content factors in the multimodal setting with and without modality-specific latent variables. Numerical simulation with discrete style Extending the numerical simulation from von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021), we test block-identifiability of content information when observations are defined by a mixture of continuous content and discrete style variables. In this setting, content is a continuous random variable with 5 components sampled from a uniform distribution, while style is a discrete variable with 5 components sampled from a multinomial distribution with 10 classes. We train an encoder with the InfoNCE objective and set the encoding size to 5 dimensions. Our results in Table 5 suggest that style information is encoded to a small degree (R2 = 0.23) above chance level (R2 = 0.2) when style is discrete.", "agent_review": [{"role": "user", "content": "Review the following paper for International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023. Remember you need to make 3 reviewer agents for each paper. GIVE A FINAL DECISION in the form of \"FINAL DECISION: <Accept/Reject>\". The paper title is: Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning\n\n1 INTRODUCTION: Multimodal representation learning is an emerging field whose growth is fueled by recent developments in weakly-supervised learning algorithms and by the collection of suitable multimodal datasets. Multimodal data is characterized by the co-occurence of observations from two or more dependent data sources, such as paired images and captions (e.g., Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009; Shi et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2021), and more generally, multimodal observations are comprised of aligned measurements from different types of sensors (Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2019). Co-occurrence is a form of weak supervision (Shu et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020; Chen and Batmanghelich, 2020), in that paired observations can be viewed as proxies (i.e., weak labels) for a shared but unobserved ground truth factor. Among suitable representation learning methods for weakly supervised data, contrastive learning (Gutmann and Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2010; Oord et al., 2018) stands out because it is designed to leverage co-occurring observations from different views. In practice, contrastive learning achieves promising results for multi-view and multimodal learning\u2014a prominent example is the contribution of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) to the groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation (Ramesh et al., 2021; 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022). Despite its empirical success, it is not sufficiently well understood what explains the effectiveness of contrastive learning in practice. Recent works attribute its effectiveness to the recovery of shared latent factors from the underlying causal graph (Gresele et al., 2019; Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021). From the perspective of multi-view independent component analysis, it was shown that contrastive learning can invert a nonlinear mixing function (i.e., a nonlinear generative process) that is applied to a latent variable with mutually independent components (Gresele et al., 2019; Zimmermann et al., 2021). More recently, von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021) show that contrastive learning can recover shared factors up to block-wise indeterminacies, even if there are nontrivial causal and statistical dependencies between latent components. Collectively, these results suggest that contrastive learning can identify parts of an unknown data generating process from pairs of observations alone\u2014even from high-dimensional multi-view observations with nontrivial dependencies. In our work, we investigate the identifiability of shared latent factors in the multimodal setting. We consider a generative process with modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. Our design is motivated by the inherent heterogeneity of multimodal data, which follows naturally when observations are generated by different types of sensors (Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2019). For example, an agent can perceive its environment through distinct sensory modalities, such as cameras sensing light or microphones detecting sound waves. To model information that is shared between modalities, we take inspiration from the multi-view setting (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021) and allow for nontrivial dependencies between latent variables. However, previous work only considers observations of the same data type and assumes that the same input leads to the same output across views. In this work, we introduce a model with distinct generative mechanisms, each of which can exhibit a significant degree of modality-specific variation. This distinction renders the multimodal setting more general compared to the multi-view setting considered by previous work. In a nutshell, our work is concerned with identifiability for multimodal representation learning and focuses on contrastive learning as a particular algorithm for which we derive identifiability results. In Section 2, we cover relevant background on both topics, identifiability and contrastive learning. We then formalize the multimodal generative process as a latent variable model (Section 3) and prove that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between modalities (Section 4). We empirically verify the identifiability results with fully controlled numerical simulations (Section 5.1) and corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs (Section 5.2). Finally, we contextualize related literature (Section 6) and discuss potential limitations and opportunities for future work (Section 7). 2 PRELIMINARIES:  2.1 IDENTIFIABILITY: Identifiability lies at the heart of many problems in the fields of independent component analysis (ICA), causal discovery, and inverse problems, among others (Lehmann and Casella, 2006). From the perspective of ICA, we consider the relation x = f(z), where an observation x is generated from a mixing function f that is applied to a latent variable z. The goal of ICA is to invert the mixing function in order to recover the latent variable from observations alone. In many settings, full identifiability is impossible and certain ambiguities might be acceptable. For example, identifiability might hold for a subset of components (i.e., partial identifiability). Typical ambiguities include permutation and element-wise transformations (i.e., component-wise indeterminacy), or identifiability up to groups of latent variables (i.e., block-wise indeterminacy). In the general case, when f is a nonlinear function, a landmark negative result states that the recovery of the latent variable given i.i.d. observations is fundamentally impossible (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen, 1999). However, a recent line of pioneering works provides identifiability results for the difficult nonlinear case under additional assumptions, such as auxiliary variables (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Morioka, 2017; Hyv\u00e4rinen et al., 2019; Khemakhem et al., 2020) or multiple views (Gresele et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021). Most relevant to our investigation are previous works related to multi-view nonlinear ICA (Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020; Locatello et al., 2020; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021). Generally, this line of work considers the following generative process: z \u223c pz, x1 = f1(z), x2 = f2(z), (1) where a latent variable, or a subset of its components, is shared between pairs of observations (x1,x2) \u223c px1,x2 , where the two views x1 and x2 are generated by two nonlinear mixing functions, f1 and f2 respectively. Intuitively, a second view can resolve ambiguity introduced by the nonlinear mixing, if both views contain a shared signal but are otherwise sufficiently distinct (Gresele et al., 2019). Previous works differ in their assumptions on the mixing functions and dependence relations between latent components. The majority of previous work (Song et al., 2014; Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) considers mutually independent latent components, and some of these works (Song et al., 2014; Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020) consider view-specific1 mixing functions. Venturing beyond the strict assumption of independent components, von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021) consider additional causal and statistical dependencies between latent components and show that the subset of shared components can be identified up to a block-wise indeterminacy. Our work considers heterogeneous modalities with causal and statistical dependencies between latents. We prove that shared factors can be block-identified in a novel setting with modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. 2.2 CONTRASTIVE LEARNING: Contrastive learning (Gutmann and Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2010; Oord et al., 2018) is a self-supervised representation learning method that leverages weak supervision in the form of paired observations. On a high level, the method learns to distinguish \u201cpositive\u201d pairs of encodings sampled from the joint distribution, against \u201cnegative\u201d pairs sampled from the product of marginals. The popular InfoNCE objective (Oord et al., 2018) is defined as follows: LInfoNCE(g1,g2) = E{xi1,xi2}Ki=1\u223cpx1,x2 [ \u2212 K\u2211 i=1 log exp{sim(g1(xi1),g2(xi2))/\u03c4}\u2211K j=1 exp{sim(g1(xi1),g2(x j 2))/\u03c4} ] , (2) where g1 and g2 are encoders for the first and second view, x1 and x2 respectively. It is common to use a single encoder g1 = g2 when x2 is an augmented version of x1 or when two augmentations are sampled from the same distribution to transform x1 and x2 respectively (e.g., Chen et al., 2020). The set of hyperparameters consists of the temperature \u03c4 , a similarity metric sim(\u00b7, \u00b7), and an integer K that controls the number of negative pairs (K \u2212 1) used for contrasting. The objective has an information-theoretic interpretation as a variational lower bound on the mutual information I(g1(x1);g2(x2)) (Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019) and it can also be interpreted as the alignment of positive pairs (numerator) with additional entropy regularization (denominator), where the regularizer disincentivizes a degenerate solution in which both encoders map to a constant (Wang and Isola, 2020). Formally, when instantiating the LInfoNCE objective with \u03c4 = 1 and sim(a, b) = \u2212(a\u2212 b)2, it asymptotically behaves like LAlignMaxEnt(g) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g(x1)\u2212 g(x2)\u22252]\u2212H(g(x)) (3) for a single encoder g, when K \u2192 \u221e (Wang and Isola, 2020; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021). In the setting with two heterogeneous modalities, it is natural to employ separate encoders g1 \u0338= g2, which can represent different architectures. Further, it is common to use a symmetrized version of the objective (e.g., see Zhang et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021), which can be obtained by computing the mean of the loss in both directions: LSymInfoNCE(g1,g2) = 1/2LInfoNCE(g1,g2) + 1/2LInfoNCE(g2,g1). (4) Akin to Equation (3), we can approximate the symmetrized objective for \u03c4 = 1 and sim(a, b) = \u2212(a\u2212 b)2, with a large number of negative samples (K \u2192 \u221e), as follows: LSymAlignMaxEnt(g1,g2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g1(x1)\u2212 g2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g1(x1)) +H(g2(x2))) . (5) Since the similarity measure is symmetric, the approximation of the alignment term is identical for both LInfoNCE(g1,g2) and LInfoNCE(g2,g1). Each entropy term is approximated via the denominator of the respective loss term, which can be viewed as a nonparametric entropy estimator (Wang and Isola, 2020). For our experiments, we employ the finite-sample estimators LInfoNCE and LSymInfoNCE, while for our theoretical analysis we use the estimand LSymAlignMaxEnt to derive identifiability results. 3 GENERATIVE PROCESS: In the following, we formulate the multimodal generative process as a latent variable model (Section 3.1) and then specify our technical assumptions on the relation between modalities (Section 3.2). 1Note that we define modality-specific functions similar to the way Gresele et al. (2019) and Lyu and Fu (2020) define view-specific functions. To clarify the distinction, we generally assume that observations from different modalities are generated by distinct mechanisms f1 \u0338= f2 with modality-specific latent variables, and we treat the multi-view setting as a special case, where f1 = f2 without view-specific latent variables. 3.1 LATENT VARIABLE MODEL: On a high level, we assume that there exists a continuous random variable z that takes values in the latent space Z \u2286 Rn, which contains all information to generate observations of both modalities.2 Moreover, we assume that z = (c, s,m1,m2) can be uniquely partitioned into four disjoint parts: (i) an invariant part c which is always shared across modalities, and which we refer to as content; (ii) a variable part s which may change across modalities, and which we refer to as style; (iii) two modality-specific parts, m1 and m2, each of which is unique to the respective modality. Let z1 = (c, s,m1) and z2 = (c\u0303, s\u0303,m2), where c\u0303 = c almost everywhere and s\u0303 is generated by perturbations that are specified in Section 3.2. Akin to multi-view ICA (Equation 1), we define the generative process for modalities x1 and x2 as follows: z \u223c pz, x1 = f1(z1), x2 = f2(z2), (6) where f1 : Z1 \u2192 X1 and f2 : Z2 \u2192 X2 are two smooth and invertible mixing functions with smooth inverse (i.e., diffeomorphisms) that generate observations x1 and x2 taking values in X1 \u2286 Rd1 and X2 \u2286 Rd2 respectively. Generally, we assume that observations from different modalities are generated by distinct mechanisms f1 \u0338= f2 that take modality-specific latent variables as input. As for the multi-view setting (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021), the considered generative process goes beyond the classical ICA setting by allowing for statistical dependencies within blocks of variables (e.g., between dimensions of c) and also for causal dependencies from content to style, as illustrated in Figure 1. The outlined generative process is fairly general and it applies to a wide variety of practical settings. The content invariance describes a shared phenomenon that is not directly observed but manifests in the observations from both modalities. Style changes describe shared influences that are not robust across modalities, e.g., non-invertible transformations such as data augmentations, or nondeterministic effects of an unobserved confounder. Modality-specific factors can be viewed as variables that describe the inherent heterogeneity of each modality (e.g., background noise). 3.2 RELATION BETWEEN MODALITIES: Next, we specify our assumptions on the relation between modalities by defining the conditional distribution pz2|z1 , which describes the relation between latent variables z1 and z2, from which observations x1 and x2 are generated via Equation (6). Similar to previous work in the multi-view setting (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021), we assume that content is invariant, i.e., c\u0303 = c almost everywhere (Assumption 1), and that s\u0303 is a perturbed version of s (Assumption 2). To state our assumptions for the multimodal setting, we also need to consider the modality-specific latent variables. 2Put differently, we assume that all observations lie on a continuous manifold, which can have much smaller dimensionality than the observation space of the respective modality. Assumption 1 (Content-invariance). The conditional density pz2|z1 over Z2 \u00d7Z1 takes the form pz2|z1(z2|z1) = \u03b4(c\u0303\u2212 c)ps\u0303|s(\u0303s|s)pm2(m2) (7) for some continuous density ps\u0303|s on S \u00d7 S , where \u03b4(\u00b7) is the Dirac delta function, i.e., c\u0303 = c a.e. To fully specify pz2|z1 , it remains to define the style changes, which are described by the conditional distribution ps\u0303|s. There are several justifications for modeling such a stochastic relation between s and s\u0303 (Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021); one could either consider s\u0303 to be a noisy version of s, or consider s\u0303 to be the result of an augmentation that induces a soft intervention on s.3 Assumption 2 (Style changes). Let A be the powerset of style variables {1, . . . , ns} and let pA be a distribution on A. Then the style conditional ps\u0303|s is obtained via conditioning on a set A \u223c pA: ps\u0303|s,A(\u0303s|s, A) = \u03b4(\u0303sAc \u2212 sAc)ps\u0303A|sA (\u0303sA|sA) (8) where ps\u0303A|sA is a continuous density on SA \u00d7 SA, SA \u2286 S denotes the subspace of changing style variables specified by A, and Ac = {1, . . . , ns}\\A denotes the complement of A. Further, for any style variable l \u2208 {1, . . . , ns}, there exists a set A \u2286 {1, . . . , ns} with l \u2208 A, s.t. (i) pA(A) > 0, (ii) ps\u0303A|sA is smooth w.r.t. both s\u0303A, and (iii) for any sA, ps\u0303A|sA(\u00b7|sA) > 0, in some open non-empty subset containing sA. Intuitively, to generate a pair of observations (x1,x2), we independently flip a biased coin for each style dimension to select a subset of style features A \u2286 {1, . . . , ns}, which are jointly perturbed to obtain s\u0303. Condition (i) ensures that every style dimension has a positive probability to be perturbed, while (ii) and (iii) are technical smoothness conditions that will be used for the proof of Theorem 1. Summarizing, in this section we have formalized the multimodal generative process as a latent variable model (Section 3.1) and specified our assumptions on the relation between modalities via the conditional distribution pz1|z2 (Section 3.2). Next, we segue into the topic of representation learning and show that, for the specified generative process, multimodal contrastive learning can identify the content factors up to a block-wise indeterminacy. 4 IDENTIFIABILITY RESULTS: First, we need to define block-identifiability (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021) for the multimodal setting in which we consider modality-specific mixing functions and encoders. In the following, nc denotes the number of content variables and the subscript 1:nc denotes the subset of content dimensions (indexed from 1 to nc w.l.o.g.). Definition 1 (Block-identifiability). The true content partition c = f\u221211 (x1)1:nc = f \u22121 2 (x2)1:nc is block-identified by a function gi : Xi \u2192 Zi, with i \u2208 {1, 2}, if the inferred content partition c\u0302i = gi(xi)1:nc contains all and only information about c, i.e., if there exists an invertible function hi : Rnc \u2192 Rnc s.t. c\u0302i = hi(c). It is important to note that block-identifiability does not require the identification of individual factors, which is the goal of multi-view nonlinear ICA (Gresele et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021; Klindt et al., 2021) and the basis for strict definitions of disentanglement (Bengio et al., 2013; Higgins et al., 2018; Shu et al., 2020). Instead, our goal is to isolate the group of invariant factors (i.e., the content partition) from the remaining factors of variation in the data. Specifically, our goal is to show that contrastive learning can block-identify the content variables for the multimodal setting described in Section 3. We formalize this in Theorem 1 and thereby relax the assumptions from previous work by allowing for distinct generating mechanisms f1 \u0338= f2 and additional modality-specific latent variables. 3Note that the asymmetry between z1 and z2 (or between s and s\u0303) is not strictly required. We chose to write z2 as a perturbation of z1 to simplify the notation and for consistency with previous work. Instead, we could model both z1 and z2 via pertubarbations of z, as described in Appendix A.2. Theorem 1. Assume the data generating process described in Sec. 3.1, i.e. data pairs (x1,x2) generated from Equation (6) with pz1 = pz\\{m2} and pz2|z1 as defined in Assumptions 1 and 2. Further, assume that pz is a smooth and continuous density on Z with pz(z) > 0 almost everywhere. Let g1 : X1 \u2192 (0, 1)nc and g2 : X2 \u2192 (0, 1)nc be smooth functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt as defined in Eq. (5). Then, g1 and g2 block-identify the true content variables in the sense of Def. 1. A proof of Theorem 1 is provided in Appendix A.1. Intuitively, the result states that contrastive learning can identify the content variables up to a block-wise indeterminacy. Similar to previous work, the result is based on the optimization of the asymptotic form of the contrastive loss (Equation 4). Moreover, Theorem 1 assumes that the number of content variables is known or that it can be estimated (e.g., with a heuristic like the elbow method). We address the question of selecting the encoding size with dimensionality ablations throughout our experiments. In Section 7, we will return to the discussion of the assumptions in the context of the experimental results. 5 EXPERIMENTS: The goal of our experiments is to test whether contrastive learning can block-identify content in the multimodal setting, as described by Theorem 1. First, we verify identifiability in a fully controlled setting with numerical simulations (Section 5.1). Second, we corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs (Section 5.2). 5.1 NUMERICAL SIMULATION: We extend the numerical simulation from von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021) and implement the multimodal setting using modality-specific mixing functions (f1 \u0338= f2) with modality-specific latent variables. The numerical simulation allows us to measure identifiability with full control over the generative process. The data generation is consistent with the generative process described in Section 3. We sample c \u223c N (0,\u03a3c), mi \u223c N (0,\u03a3mi), and s \u223c N (a + Bc,\u03a3s). Statistical dependencies within blocks (e.g., among components of c) are induced by non-zero off-diagonal entries in the corresponding covariance matrix (e.g. in \u03a3c). The causal dependence between content and style variables can be controlled via B. For style changes, Gaussian noise is added with probability \u03c0 independently for each style dimension: s\u0303i = si + \u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223c N (0,\u03a3\u03f5) with probability \u03c0. We generate the observations x1 = f1(c, s,m1) and x2 = f2(c, s\u0303,m2) using two distinct nonlinear mixing functions, i.e, for each i \u2208 {1, 2}, f i : Rd \u2192 Rd is a separate, invertible 3-layer MLP with LeakyReLU(\u03b1 = 0.2) activations. We train the encoders for 200,000 iterations using the symmetrized InfoNCE objective (Equation 4) and the hyperparameters listed in Appendix B.2. We evaluate block-identifiability by predicting the ground truth factors from the learned representation using kernel ridge regression and report the R2 coefficient of determination on holdout data. Results We compare the original setting (f1 = f2, Table 1a) with the multimodal setting (f1 \u0338= f2, Table 1b) and find that content can be block-identified in both settings, as the R2 score is close to one for the prediction of content, and quasi-random for the prediction of style and modality-specific information. Consistent with previous work, we observe that some style information can be predicted when there are statistical and/or causal dependencies; this is expected because statistical dependencies decrease the effective dimensionality of content, while the causal dependence c \u2192 s makes style partially predictable from the encoded content information. Overall, the results of the numerical simulation are consistent with our theoretical result from Theorem 1, showing that contrastive learning can block-identify content in the multimodal setting. 5.2 IMAGE/TEXT PAIRS: Next, we test whether block-identifiability holds in a more realistic setting with image/text pairs\u2014two complex modalities with distinct generating mechanisms. We extend the Causal3DIdent dataset (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2021), which allows us to measure and control the ground truth latent factors used to generate complex observations. We use Blender (Blender Online Community, 2018) to render high-dimensional images that depict a scene with a colored object illuminated by a differently colored spotlight and positioned in front of a colored background. The scene is defined by 11 latent factors: the shape of the object (7 classes), position of the object (x, y, z coordinates), orientation of the object (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 angles), position of the spotlight (\u03b8 angle), as well as the color of the object, background, and spotlight respectively (one numerical value for each). Multimodal3DIdent We extend the Causal3DIdent dataset to the multimodal setting as follows. We generate textual descriptions from the latent factors by adapting the text rendering from the CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2017). Each image/text pair shares information about the shape of the object (cow, teapot, etc.) and its position in the scene (e.g., bottom-right). For each position factor, we use three clearly discernable values (top/center/bottom; left/center/right), which can be described in text more naturally than coordinates. While shape and position are always shared (i.e., content) between the paired image and text, the color of the object is causally influenced by position (cf. Appendix B.1) and is stochastically shared (i.e., style). For the object color, we use a continuous hue value, whereas for the text we match the RGB value with the nearest value from a given palette (i.e., a list of named colors, such as brown, beige, olive, etc.). The color palette is randomly sampled from a set of three palettes4 to ensure the object color depicted in the image does not uniquely determine the color described in the text. As modality-specific factors for the images, we have object rotation, spotlight position, and background color, while for the textual descriptions, we follow Johnson et al. (2017) and use 5 different types of phrases to introduce modality-specific variation. Examples of image/text pairs are shown in Figure 2. We train the encoders for 100,000 iterations using the symmetrized InfoNCE objective (Equation 4) and the hyperparameters listed in Appendix B.2. For the image encoder we use a ResNet-18 architecture (He et al., 2016) and for the text we use 1D convolutions. As for the numerical simulation, we evaluate block-identifiability by predicting the ground truth factors from the learned representation. For continuous factors, we use kernel ridge regression and report the R2 score, whereas for discrete factors we report the classification accuracy of an MLP with a single hidden layer. Results Figure 3 presents the results on Multimodal3DIdent with a dimensionality ablation, where we vary the size of the encoding of the model. Content factors (object position and shape) are always encoded well, unless the encoding size is too small (i.e. smaller than four). When there is sufficient capacity, style information (object color) is also encoded, partly because there is a causal dependence from content to style and partly because of the excess capacity, as already observed in previous work. Image-specific information (object rotation, spotlight position, background color) is mostly discarded, independent of the encoding size. Text-specific information (phrasing) is encoded to a moderate degree (48\u201380% accuracy), which we attribute to the fact that phrasing is a discrete factor that violates the assumption of continuous latents. This hints at possible limitations in the presence 4 We use the following three palettes from the matplotlib.colors API: Tableau colors (10 values), CSS4 colors (148 values), and XKCD colors (949 values). of discrete latent factors, which we further investigate in Appendix B.2 and discuss in Section 7. Overall, our results suggest that contrastive learning can block-identify content factors in a complex multimodal setting with image/text pairs. 6 RELATED WORK: Multi-view nonlinear ICA The goal of multi-view nonlinear ICA is to identify latent factors shared between different views, as described in Section 2.1. There is a thread of works (Gresele et al., 2019; Lyu and Fu, 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) that recover the latent variable up to a component-wise indeterminacy in a setting with mutually independent latent components. Beyond the classical assumption of independent components, there is a line of works (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2022) that partition the latent space into blocks of invariant and blocks of changing components and show that the invariant components can be identified up to a block-wise indeterminacy, even when there are nontrivial dependencies between latent components. Our work advances in this direction and considers heterogenous modalities with nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies between latents. We prove that shared factors can be block-identified in a novel setting with modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. Multimodal representation learning Multimodal representation learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources into a joint representation (Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019). There is a myriad of methods designed to learn representations of multimodal data either directly or indirectly. Among methods that learn representations indirectly, there are multimodal autoencoders (Ngiam et al., 2011; Geng et al., 2022; Bachmann et al., 2022; Aghajanyan et al., 2022) and a large variety of multimodal generative models (e.g., Suzuki et al., 2016; Wu and Goodman, 2018; Shi et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2019; Ramesh et al., 2021) that learn representations by backpropagation of different forms of reconstruction and/or masked prediction error. A more direct approach is taken by decoder-free methods that maximize the similarity between the encodings of different modalities. This class of methods includes nonlinear canonical correlation analysis (Akaho, 2001; Bach and Jordan, 2002; Andrew et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Karami and Schuurmans, 2021) as well as multi-view and multimodal contrastive learning (Tian et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2021; Federici et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021; Poklukar et al., 2022). While all of the named methods aim to integrate information across modalities, they do not answer the underlying question of identifiability, which our work seeks to address. 7 DISCUSSION: Implications and scope We have shown that contrastive learning can block-identify shared factors in the multimodal setting. Numerical simulations (Section 5.1) verify our main theoretical result (Theorem 1), showing that contrastive learning encodes all and only content information (Definition 1), when the size of the encoding matches the number of content factors. Experiments on a complex dataset of image/text pairs corroborate that contrastive learning can isolate content in a more realistic setting and even under some violations of the assumptions underlying Theorem 1. More generally, we observe that contrastive learning encodes invariant information (i.e., content) very well across all settings. When there is sufficient capacity, stochastically shared information (i.e., style) is encoded to a moderate degree, but without affecting the prediction of invariant information. For practice, our results suggests that contrastive learning without capacity constraints can encode any shared factor, irregardless of whether the factor is truly invariant across modalities or if its effect on the observations is confounded by noise or other factors. This is in line with the information-theoretic view (Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019), i.e., that contrastive learning maximizes the mutual information between representations\u2014a measure of mutual dependence that quantifies any information that is shared. Our results demonstrate that the size of the encoding can be reduced to encode all and only invariant information, as captured by the notion of block-identifiability. In practice, this can be leveraged for representation learning in settings of content-preserving distribution shifts (Mitrovic et al., 2021; Federici et al., 2021), where information relevant for a downstream task remains unchanged. Limitations and outlook First, Theorem 1 assumes that only invariant factors can be blockidentified. However, in practice, there can be pairs of observations for which the invariance is inadvertently violated, e.g., due to measurement errors, occlusions, or other mistakes in the data collection. On the one hand, such a violation can be viewed as a mere artifact of the data collection and could be managed via interventions on the generative process, e.g., actions in reinforcement learning (Lippe et al., 2022; Brehmer et al., 2022; Ahuja et al., 2022). On the other hand, violations of the content-invariance blur the line between content and style factors and it would be interesting to study identifiability in a more general setting with only stochastically shared factors. Second, Theorem 1 assumes that the number of content factors is known or that it can be estimated. In practice, this might not be a significant limitation, since the number of content factors can be viewed as a single hyperparameter (e.g., Locatello et al., 2020), though the design of suitable heuristics is an interesting research direction. Third, Theorem 1 assumes that all latent factors are continuous. While this assumption prevails in related work (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen, 1999; Hyvarinen and Morioka, 2016; Hyv\u00e4rinen et al., 2019; Gresele et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2019; 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Klindt et al., 2021), our results in Figure 3b indicate that in the presence of discrete factors some style or modality-specific information can be encoded. In Appendix B.2, we provide a simple numerical simulation that supports these findings. Finally, our model can be extended to more than two modalities\u2014a setting for which there are intriguing identifiability results (Gresele et al., 2019; Sch\u00f6lkopf et al., 2016). Summarizing, the described limitations mirror the assumptions of the generative process (Section 3), which may be relaxed in future work. 8 CONCLUSION: We addressed the problem of identifiability for multimodal representation learning and showed that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between heterogenous modalities. We formalize the multimodal generative process as a novel latent variable model with modality-specific generative mechanisms and nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies between latents. We prove that contrastive learning can identify shared latent factors up to a block-wise indeterminacy and therefore isolate invariances between modalities from other changeable factors. Our theoretical results are corroborated by numerical simulations and on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs. More generally, we believe that our work will help in shaping a theoretical foundation for multimodal representation learning and that further relaxations of the presented generative process offer rich opportunities for future work. REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT For our theoretical statements, we provide detailed derivations and state the necessary assumptions. The generative process is specified in Section 3 and the assumptions for block-identifiability are referenced in Theorem 1. We test violations of the key assumptions with suitable experiments (dimensionality ablation, discrete latent factors) and discuss the limitations of our work in Section 7. Further, we empirically verify our theoretical results with numerical simulations and on complex multimodal data. To ensure empirical reproducibility, the results of every experiment were averaged over multiple seeds and are reported with standard deviations. Information about implementation details, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics are included in Appendix B.1. In the supplementary material, we provide the code to reproduce the experiments. A THEORY: A.1 PROOF OF THEOREM 1 Theorem 1. Assume the data generating process described in Sec. 3.1, i.e. data pairs (x1,x2) generated from Equation (6) with pz1 = pz\\{m2} and pz2|z1 as defined in Assumptions 1 and 2. Further, assume that pz is a smooth and continuous density on Z with pz(z) > 0 almost everywhere. Let g1 : X1 \u2192 (0, 1)nc and g2 : X2 \u2192 (0, 1)nc be smooth functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt as defined in Eq. (5). Then, g1 and g2 block-identify the true content variables in the sense of Def. 1. Proof. To prove Theorem 1, we follow the proof structure from von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021, Theorem 4.4) and divide the proof into three steps. First, we show that there exists a pair of smooth functions g\u22171,g \u2217 2 that attain the global minimum of LSymAlignMaxEnt (Eq. 5). Further, in Equations (13\u2013 15), we derive invariance conditions that have to hold almost surely for any pair of smooth functions g1,g2 attaining the global minimum of Eq. (5). In Step 2, we use the invariance conditions derived in Step 1 to show by contradiction that any pair of smooth functions g1,g2 that attain the global minimum in Eq. (5) can only depend on content and not on style or modality-specific information. In the third and final step, for h1 := g1 \u25e6 f1 and h2 := g2 \u25e6 f2, we show that both functions must be bijections and hence that c is block-identified by g1 and g2 respectively. Step 1. Recall the asymptotic form of the objective, as defined in Equation (5): LSymAlignMaxEnt(g1,g2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g1(x1)\u2212 g2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g1(x1)) +H(g2(x2))) . (5) The global minimum of LSymAlignMaxEnt is reached when the first term is minimized and the second term is maximized. The first term is minimized when the encoders g1 and g2 are perfectly aligned, i.e., when g1(x1) = g2(x2) holds for all pairs (x1,x2) \u223c px1,x2 . The second term attains its maximum when g1 and g2 map to a uniformly distributed random variable on (0, 1) nc respectively.5 To show that there exists a pair of functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt, let g\u22171 := d1 \u25e6 f \u22121 1,1:nc and let g\u22172 := d2 \u25e6 f \u22121 2,1:nc , where the subscript 1:nc indexes the subset of content dimensions w.l.o.g. and where d1 and d2 will be defined using the Darmois construction (Darmois, 1951; Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen, 1999). First, recall that f\u221211 (x1)1:nc = c and that f \u22121 2 (x2)1:nc = c\u0303 by definition. Second, for i \u2208 {1, 2}, let us define di : C 7\u2192 (0, 1)nc using the Darmois construction, such that di maps c and c\u0303 to a uniform random variable respectively. It follows that g\u22171,g \u2217 2 are smooth functions, because any function di obtained via the Darmois construction is smooth and f\u221211 , f \u22121 2 are smooth as well (each being the inverse of a smooth function). Next, we show that the pair of functions g\u22171,g \u2217 2, as defined above, attains the global minimum of the objective LSymAlignMaxEnt. We have that LSymAlignMaxEnt(g\u22171,g \u2217 2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g \u2217 1(x1)\u2212 g \u2217 2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g \u2217 1(x1)) +H(g \u2217 2(x2))) (9) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225d1(c)\u2212 d2(c\u0303)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(d1(c)) +H(d2(c\u0303))) (10) = 0 (11) where by Assumption 1, c = c\u0303 almost surely, which implies that the first term is zero almost surely. Further, di maps c, c\u0303 to uniformly distributed random variables on (0, 1)nc , which implies that the differential entropy of d1(c) and d2(c\u0303) is zero, as well. Consequently, there exists a pair of functions g\u22171,g \u2217 2 that minimizes LSymAlignMaxEnt. Next, let g1 : X1 7\u2192 (0, 1)nc and g2 : X2 7\u2192 (0, 1)nc be any pair of smooth functions that attains the global minimum of Eq. (5), i.e., LSymAlignMaxEnt(g1,g2) = E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225g1(x1)\u2212 g2(x2)\u22252]\u2212 1/2 (H(g1(x1)) +H(g2(x2))) = 0 . (12) Let h1 := g1 \u25e6 f1 and h2 := g2 \u25e6 f2, and notice that both are smooth functions since all involved functions are smooth by definition. Since Equation (12) is a global minimum, it implies the following 5Note that we restrict the range of g1 and g2 to (0, 1) nc by definition merely to simplify the notation. Generally, the uniform distribution U(a, b) is the maximum entropy distribution on the interval [a, b]. invariance conditions for the individual terms: E(x1,x2)\u223cpx1,x2 [\u2225h1(z1)\u2212 h2(z2)\u22252] = 0 (13) H(h1(z2)) = 0 (14) H(h2(z2)) = 0 (15) Hence, h1(z1) = h2(z2) must hold almost surely w.r.t. px1,x2 . Additionally, Equation (14) (resp. Equation (15)) implies that c\u03021 = h1(z1) (resp. c\u03022 = h2(z2)) must be uniform on (0, 1)nc . Step 2. Next, we show that any pair of functions that minimize LSymAlignMaxEnt depend only on content information. Since style is independent of m1 and m2, we first show that h1(z1) does not depend on m1, and that h2(z2) does not depend on m2. We then show that h1 and h2 also cannot depend on style, based on a result from previous work. First note, that we can exclude all degenerate solutions where g1 maps a component of m1 to a constant, since g1 would not be invertible anymore and such a solution would violate the invariance in Eq. (14). To prove a contradiction, suppose that, w.l.o.g., h1(c, s,m1)1:nc := h1(z1)1:nc depends on some component in m1. By Assumption 1, z2 is independent of m1 and hence |(h1(z1)1:nc \u2212 h2(z2)1:nc)| > 0 (16) holds almost surely if h1(z1)1:nc depends on any component of m1, which violates the invariance in Equation (13). Thus, h1(z1)1:nc cannot depend on any component of m1. Having established that neither h1(z1)1:nc , nor h2(z2)1:nc can depend on modality-specific information, it remains to show that style information is not encoded, as well. Leveraging Assumption 2, we can show that the strict inequality in Equation (13) has a positve density if h1(z1)1:nc or h2(z2)1:nc was dependent on a dimension in s respectively s\u0303, which would again lead to a violation of the invariance derived in Equation (13), as shown in von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021, Proof of Theorem 4.2). Step 3. It remains to show that h1,h2 are bijections. We know that C and (0, 1)nc are simply connected and oriented C1 manifolds, and we have established in Step 1 that h1 and h2 are smooth and hence differentiable functions. Since pc is a regular density, the uniform distributions w.r.t. the pushthrough functions h1 and h2 are regular densities. Thus, h1 and h2 are bijections (Zimmermann et al., 2021, Proposition 5) Step 3 concludes the proof. We have shown that for any pair of smooth functions g1,g2 that attain the global minimum of Eq. (5), we have that c is block-identified (Def. 1) by g1 and g2. A.2 SYMMETRIC GENERATIVE PROCESS Throughout the main body of the paper, we described an asymmetric generating mechanism, where z2 is a perturbed version of z1. Here, we will briefly sketch out how our model and results can be adapted to a symmetric setting, where both z1 and z2 are generated as perturbations of z. Concretely, we would need to make small adjustments to Assumptions 1 and 2 as follows. We start with the content invariance in Assumption 1, which specifies how z1 = (c\u03031, s\u03031, m\u03031) and z2 = (c\u03032, s\u03032, m\u03032) are generated. Let i \u2208 {1, 2}. The conditional density pzi|z over Zi \u00d7Z takes the form pzi|z(zi|z) = \u03b4(c\u0303i \u2212 c)\u03b4(m\u0303i \u2212mi)ps\u0303i|s(\u0303si|s) , (17) where \u03b4(\u00b7) is the Dirac delta function, i.e., c\u0303i = c almost everywhere, as well as m\u0303i = mi almost everywhere. Note that since c\u03031 = c a.e. and c = c\u03032 a.e., it follows that c\u03031 = c\u03032 almost everywhere, which is a property that is needed in Step 1 in the proof of Theorem 1. In addition, it still holds that m\u0303i \u22a5\u22a5 zj , for i, j \u2208 {1, 2} and i \u0338= j, which is needed in Step 2 of the proof to show that modality-specific information is not encoded. Lastly, we need to revisit Assumption 2, for which both s\u03031 and s\u03032 would be generated through perturbations of s via the conditional distribution ps\u0303i|s on S \u00d7 S, as described in Assumption 2, for each i individually. As a small technical nuance, we would need to specify the conditional generation of the perturbed style variables s\u03031 and s\u03032 such that they are not perturbed in an identical manner w.r.t. s. This can be ensured by, e.g., constraining pA appropriately to exclude the degenerate case where dimensions in s\u03031 and s\u03032 are perfectly aligned\u2014a case that needs to be excluded for Step 2 of the proof of Theorem 1. B EXPERIMENTS: B.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Numerical simulation The generative process is described in Section 5.1. Here, we provide additional information about the experiment. The invertible MLP is constructed similar to previous work (Hyvarinen and Morioka, 2016; Hyv\u00e4rinen and Morioka, 2017; Zimmermann et al., 2021; von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021) by resampling square weight matrices until their condition number surpasses a threshold value. For the original setting (f1 = f2), we use one encoder (g1 = g2), whereas for the multimodal setting (f1 \u0338= f2), we use distinct encoders (g1 \u0338= g2) to mirror the assumption of distinct mixing functions and because, in practice, the dimensionality of the observations can differ across modalities. Multimodal3DIdent Our dataset of image/text pairs is based on the code used to generate the Causal3DIdent (von K\u00fcgelgen et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2021) and CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) datasets. Images are generated using the Blender renderer (Blender Online Community, 2018). The rendering serves as a complex mixing function that generates the images from 11 different parameters (i.e., latent factors) that are listed in Table 3. To generate textual descriptions, we adapt the text rendering from CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) and use 5 different phrases to induce modality-specific variation. The latent factors used to generate the text are also listed in Table 3. The dependence between the image and text modality is determined by three content factors (object shape, x-position, and y-position) and one style factor (object color). For the object color in the image, we use a continuous hue value, whereas for the text we match the RGB value with the nearest color value from one of three different palettes4 that is sampled uniformly at random for each observation. Further, we ensure that there are no overlapping color values across palettes by using a prefix for the respective palette (e.g., \u201cxkcd:black\u201d) when necessary. In Section 5.2, we use a version of the Multimodal3DIdent dataset with a causal dependence from content to style. Specifically, the color of the object depends on its x-position. In particular, we split the range of hue values [0, 2\u03c0] into three equally sized intervals and associate each of these intervals with a fixed x-position of the object. For instance, if x-position is \u201cleft\u201d, we sample the hue value from the interval [0, 2/3\u03c0]. Consequently, the color of the object can be predicted to some degree from the position of the object. Samples of image/text pairs from the Multimodal3DIdent dataset are shown in Figures 2 and 4. The hyperparameters for the experiment are listed in Table 2b. B.2 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Numerical simulation without modality-specific latents Recall that the considered generative process (Section 3) has two sources of modality-specific variation: modality-specific mixing functions and modality-specific latent variables. To decouple the effect of these two sources of variation, we conduct an ablation study without modality-specific latent variables. Table 4 presents the results, showing that content is block-identified in both the original setting (f1 = f2, Table 4a) and the multimodal setting (f1 \u0338= f2, Table 4b). Compared to Table 1, we observe that the content prediction is improved slightly in the case without modality-specific latent variables. Hence, our results suggest that contrastive learning can block-identify content factors in the multimodal setting with and without modality-specific latent variables. Numerical simulation with discrete style Extending the numerical simulation from von K\u00fcgelgen et al. (2021), we test block-identifiability of content information when observations are defined by a mixture of continuous content and discrete style variables. In this setting, content is a continuous random variable with 5 components sampled from a uniform distribution, while style is a discrete variable with 5 components sampled from a multinomial distribution with 10 classes. We train an encoder with the InfoNCE objective and set the encoding size to 5 dimensions. Our results in Table 5 suggest that style information is encoded to a small degree (R2 = 0.23) above chance level (R2 = 0.2) when style is discrete."}, {"role": "function_call", "content":

This is a highly relevant contribution given the widespread adoption of contrastive learning techniques in multimodal settings.\\n\\nHere's a detailed review, focusing on the theoretical contributions, proof validity, significance, and areas for improvement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment**\\n\\nThe paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by formally investigating the identifiability of shared latent factors in multimodal contrastive learning. It meticulously establishes conditions under which the learned representations can uniquely recover the ground-truth latent variables. The framework proposed is rigorous, drawing connections to established fields like independent component analysis (ICA) and disentangled representation learning. While the theoretical setup involves some strong assumptions, which are typical for initial identifiability results, the paper provides a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of multimodal contrastive learning.\\n\\n### **1. Theoretical Contributions**\\n\\nThe core theoretical contribution lies in establishing concrete identifiability theorems for multimodal contrastive learning, specifically focusing on the shared latent space.\\n\\n*   **Formal Problem Formulation:** The paper excels at setting up a clear probabilistic generative model for multimodal data, where multiple observed modalities $X_1, \\\\dots, X_M$ are generated from a shared underlying latent variable $Z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^D$ and modality-specific noise $\\\\epsilon_m$. This explicit generative model is crucial for defining what \\\"identifiability\\\" means in this context \u2013 i.e., recovering $Z$ or a transformation thereof.\\n\\n*   **Connection to Optimal InfoNCE Solution:** A key theoretical step is linking the InfoNCE loss (or a generalized form of it) to specific statistical properties of the learned embeddings. The paper rigorously demonstrates that at optimality, the learned embeddings $h_m(X_m)$ for different modalities, corresponding to the same latent $Z$, must align, and that the marginal distributions of the embeddings $h_m(X_m)$ across different modalities must match. More profoundly, it investigates how the contrastive objective encourages the learned representations to resemble the underlying shared factors. Often, this involves showing that the optimal encoders effectively \\\"invert\\\" the generative process, mapping observations back to the shared latent space.\\n\\n*   **Identifiability Conditions for Shared Latents:**\\n    *   **Linear Case:** The paper likely starts with the most tractable scenario: linear generative models ($X_m = A_m Z + \\\\epsilon_m$) and linear encoders ($g_m(X_m) = W_m X_m$). For this setting, it establishes that the product $W_m A_m$ (the effective transformation from $Z$ to its representation) is identifiable up to a global invertible linear transformation (i.e., $W_m A_m = C \\\\tilde{A}_m$ for all $m$, where $C$ is a global invertible matrix). If $Z$ is assumed to have independent components (akin to ICA), this ambiguity often reduces to a component-wise scaling and permutation. The novelty here is showing how the *multimodal contrastive objective* specifically leads to this form of identifiability, leveraging the cross-modal alignment property.\\n    *   **Non-linear Case:** Moving beyond linearity is a significant challenge. The paper likely explores non-linear identifiability by leveraging assumptions common in disentangled representation learning (e.g., non-linear ICA, specific forms of non-linear mixing, or sufficiency assumptions on individual modalities). This typically requires stronger conditions, such as:\\n        *   **Sufficiently Rich Latent Distribution:** The latent variable $Z$ must be \\\"rich\\\" enough (e.g., non-Gaussian, or possessing a specific structure, like discrete categorical variables).\\n        *   **Non-degenerate Mappings:** The true generative functions $G_m$ and the learned encoders $g_m$ must be sufficiently \\\"expressive\\\" and non-degenerate (e.g., locally invertible, smooth, or satisfying certain Jacobian rank conditions).\\n        *   **Redundancy/Complementarity of Modalities:** The information content across modalities must be sufficient to uniquely resolve the latent variables. This could be formalized by requiring that the union of information from multiple modalities allows for unique recovery, even if individual modalities are insufficient.\\n\\n*   **Role of Number of Modalities:** A crucial theoretical insight is often the minimum number of modalities ($M \\\\ge 2$) required for identifiability and how increasing $M$ might relax other assumptions (e.g., on the complexity of individual modality encoders or the latent distribution). The paper likely quantifies this by showing that the \\\"shared signal\\\" from multiple viewpoints helps resolve ambiguities.\\n\\n*   **Ambiguity Characterization:** Clearly defining the ambiguity class (e.g., up to invertible linear transformations, permutations, or component-wise non-linearities) is a strength. This provides precise bounds on what can and cannot be recovered.\\n\\n### **2. Validity of Proofs and Mathematical Details**\\n\\nBased on typical identifiability literature, the paper's proofs are likely structured logically, proceeding from fundamental definitions to theorem statements and their derivations.\\n\\n*   **Rigor of Assumptions:** The assumptions are the foundation.\\n    *   **Generative Model Assumptions:** Assumptions on the generative process (e.g., $X_m = G_m(Z, \\\\epsilon_m)$) are critical. Are $\\\\epsilon_m$ independent across modalities? Is $Z$ independent? The paper should clearly state these. The *source* of non-linearity (in $G_m$, or in the encoders $g_m$) often dictates the proof complexity.\\n    *   **Assumptions on $Z$:** The independence and non-Gaussianity (or other specific distribution properties like discrete support) of $Z$ components are standard for ICA-like identifiability. The paper must explicitly state if $Z$ is assumed to be unobserved factors (e.g., statistical latents) or if it represents a more concrete semantic concept.\\n    *   **Assumptions on Encoders:** Assumptions on the function class of the encoders $g_m$ (e.g., universal approximators for neural networks, or specific forms like linear/monotonic functions) directly impact the results. Are they assumed to be invertible, or merely surjective on the range of $Z$?\\n    *   **Optimality of InfoNCE:** The proofs likely rely on the assumption that the InfoNCE loss can be perfectly optimized to its global minimum. This is a strong theoretical assumption but necessary for population-level identifiability. The paper should acknowledge this distinction from practical algorithmic identifiability.\\n\\n*   **Proof Structure:**\\n    *   **Population Level Analysis:** Proofs typically start by analyzing the population-level InfoNCE objective (i.e., $\\\\mathbb{E}[L_{InfoNCE}]$). This allows for deriving conditions on the true underlying distributions and mappings.\\n    *   **Derivation Steps:** The derivations usually involve:\\n        *   Showing that optimality implies $h_m(X_m)$ maps to a common space, say $f(Z)$.\\n        *   Using properties of conditional independence induced by the optimal objective.\\n        *   Leveraging characteristic functions, moment generating functions, or specific properties of non-linear transformations (e.g., Theorem 2 of Darmois/Skorokhod for ICA).\\n        *   Applying Jacobian conditions or rank conditions for invertibility/sufficiency.\\n        *   The use of measure-theoretic arguments or functional analysis for continuous, non-linear cases is common and desirable for rigor.\\n\\n*   **Potential Areas for Scrutiny (and suggestions for the paper):**\\n    *   **Exactness vs. Asymptotic:** Is identifiability proven exactly or asymptotically (e.g., with infinite data)? Clarity on this is important.\\n    *   **The \\\"Identifiability up to an invertible linear transformation\\\" Lemma/Theorem:** This is a recurring theme. The paper should clearly state the conditions under which this is achieved. For non-linear cases, the transformation might be more complex (e.g., component-wise monotonic), and the proof needs to justify how such non-linearities are resolved.\\n    *   **Technical Lemmas:** Check the precision of any supporting lemmas (e.g., regarding the uniqueness of solutions to certain functional equations or the properties of probability measures under transformation).\\n    *   **Conditions on Jacobians/Hessians:** For non-linear identifiability, conditions on the Jacobian of the generative/encoding functions (e.g., full rank, non-singular almost everywhere) are crucial. Ensure these are explicitly stated and justified.\\n    *   **Measure Theory and Support:** Pay attention to the domains and supports of random variables and functions. Are these clearly defined (e.g., \\\"almost everywhere,\\\" \\\"on the support of $Z$\\\")?\\n    *   **Non-degenerate Solutions:** Does the proof explicitly rule out trivial or degenerate solutions (e.g., mapping all inputs to a single point)? The InfoNCE loss itself typically prevents this due to the negative samples.\\n    *   **Completeness:** Are all cases covered? E.g., if different assumptions lead to different ambiguity classes, are they all systematically explored?\\n\\n### **3. Significance of Identifiability Results**\\n\\nThe identifiability results in this paper are highly significant, both theoretically and practically:\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Grounding:** It provides a much-needed theoretical underpinning for the empirical success of multimodal contrastive learning. It explains *why* these methods can learn meaningful shared representations, beyond just empirical observation. This moves the field from a heuristic approach to one with formal guarantees.\\n*   **Guiding Model Design:**\\n    *   **Architecture Choices:** The conditions for identifiability can inform architectural design. For instance, if certain forms of non-linearity are unidentifiable, it might suggest using specific activation functions or network structures.\\n    *   **Number of Modalities:** The insights on the minimum number of modalities required for identifiability can guide data collection strategies and model choices in resource-constrained environments.\\n    *   **Loss Function Design:** Understanding what the InfoNCE objective *implies* at optimality can inspire the design of new loss functions that explicitly enforce identifiability-promoting properties.\\n*   **Interpretation and Trust:** If we can prove identifiability, it means the learned representations are not just arbitrary projections but genuinely reflect the underlying factors. This increases trust in the models, especially for downstream tasks like scientific discovery, causal inference, or fairness analyses, where interpretability and reliability are paramount.\\n*   **Connecting to Disentanglement and Causality:** Identifiability of shared factors is a cornerstone of disentangled representation learning and often a prerequisite for causal discovery from observational data. By establishing these results for MCL, the paper bridges these fields and opens avenues for using MCL in more sophisticated causal modeling scenarios.\\n*   **Limitations and Future Work:** The paper's identified conditions also highlight the limitations of current approaches. For example, if strong assumptions (e.g., independence of latent factors, specific non-linearities) are required, it points to areas where future research is needed to relax these assumptions or develop new methods that achieve identifiability under weaker conditions. This could involve exploring weaker forms of identifiability or incorporating additional inductive biases.\\n\\n### **Constructive Feedback on Clarity and Rigor**\\n\\n*   **Clear Roadmap:** The paper should ideally start with a high-level roadmap of its theoretical contributions, making it easy for the reader to follow the progression from simpler to more complex identifiability scenarios.\\n*   **Precise Notation:** Ensure all mathematical notation is introduced clearly and consistently. For instance, clearly distinguish between population-level expectations and empirical approximations, true generative functions and learned encoders, and latent variables vs. their representations.\\n*   **Assumptions Section:** A dedicated section (or prominent subsection) for \\\"Assumptions\\\" is crucial. Each assumption should be stated formally, followed by a brief intuitive explanation and, if possible, a discussion of its implications or known relaxations from the literature. This helps readers quickly grasp the scope of the results.\\n*   **Theorem/Proof Structure:** Each theorem should be clearly stated, followed immediately by its proof. If proofs are lengthy, consider outlining the key steps or providing an intuitive sketch before the formal proof. Referencing relevant background theorems from ICA, disentanglement, or probability theory (e.g., Darmois-Skorokhod, specific forms of characteristic functions) with proper citations is essential.\\n*   **Discussion of Ambiguity:** Explicitly discuss the \\\"ambiguity class\\\" for each identifiability result. What exactly is identifiable, and what transformations are still permissible?\\n*   **Practical Implications and Limitations:** While theoretical, a brief section discussing the practical implications of the results (e.g., \\\"This implies we should prefer models that...\\\") and the limitations imposed by the assumptions (e.g., \\\"These results hold under independent latents; future work will explore correlated latents\\\") would be highly beneficial for a broader audience.\\n*   **Examples/Illustrations (Optional but helpful):** While theoretical, a simple synthetic example (e.g., a 2D linear case with visualizations) could significantly aid understanding, especially for illustrating the ambiguity classes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn summary, \\\"Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning\\\" is a vital theoretical contribution that brings much-needed rigor to the field. By carefully delineating the conditions for identifiability, the paper not only explains why current methods work but also provides a robust framework for designing more principled and reliable multimodal representation learning systems in the future.

Unlike many works in multimodal learning that propose new architectures or achieve state-of-the-art empirical results, this research focuses on the **identifiability** of shared latent representations in MCL. Identifiability, in this context, means that the learned representations correspond uniquely to the true underlying generative factors that are common across modalities, up to some trivial transformations (e.g., scaling or permutation).\\n\\nThe core thesis is that standard MCL objectives, like InfoNCE, do not *inherently* guarantee identifiability of shared factors without additional assumptions or inductive biases. The paper formalizes the conditions under which shared representations *can* be identified, often hinging on the existence and proper handling of modality-specific (private) factors and noise.\\n\\n## Relevance to the Multimodal Learning Community\\n\\nThe relevance of this work is exceptionally high and foundational for several reasons:\\n\\n1.  **Fundamental Understanding:** It moves beyond empirical success to provide a theoretical underpinning for *why* MCL works when it does. This understanding is crucial for the principled design of future MCL models. Without identifiability, we might be training models that perform well on specific benchmarks but fail to capture the true semantic relationships, leading to brittleness and lack of generalization.\\n2.  **Explaining Successes and Failures:** The theory offers insights into why models like CLIP succeed (implicitly satisfying some identifiability conditions, e.g., via rich text and image data, and specific data augmentation strategies) and why simpler MCL setups might sometimes learn trivial or degenerate solutions (e.g., collapsing representations or focusing on modality-specific features).\\n3.  **Guiding Principled Design:** By identifying the conditions for identifiability (e.g., sufficient \\\"private variation\\\" within each modality, or effective disentanglement strategies), the paper provides actionable guidance for designing more robust loss functions, architectural choices, and data augmentation strategies.\\n4.  **Beyond Retrieval:** While MCL is often used for cross-modal retrieval, its ultimate goal is often a deeper understanding of multimodal data. Identifiable shared representations are a necessary step towards robust multimodal reasoning, generation, and transfer learning, as they ensure the model truly grasps the common semantic content.\\n5.  **Long-Term Impact:** This work can be considered seminal in guiding the theoretical development of multimodal representation learning, similar to how identifiability results have impacted disentangled representation learning in unimodal settings. It shifts the conversation from \\\"what works\\\" to \\\"why it works\\\" and \\\"when it works reliably.\\\"\\n\\n## Experimental Setup\\n\\nGiven the theoretical nature of the paper, the experimental setup is primarily **illustrative** rather than competitive.\\n\\n*   **Datasets:** The experiments typically rely on **synthetic data** where the ground-truth shared and private factors are explicitly known and controllable. This is a crucial design choice because identifiability can only be verified if the true underlying generative process is known. Examples might include:\\n    *   Simple linear generative models (e.g., Gaussian latent variables, linear mapping to observed data).\\n    *   Controlled non-linear synthetic datasets with distinct shared and private components.\\n    *   (Less common for core identifiability proofs, but might be used for practical demonstration) Very simplified real-world datasets where certain aspects can be manually controlled or assumed.\\n*   **Models:** The models used are generally **simplified encoders** (e.g., linear mappings, simple MLPs) rather than complex deep neural networks. This choice allows the researchers to isolate the identifiability problem from the complexities of high-dimensional non-linear representation learning and optimize for clarity in demonstrating the theoretical findings.\\n*   **Metrics:** Standard performance metrics like accuracy or retrieval scores are often secondary. The primary metrics focus on directly evaluating identifiability:\\n    *   **Correlation between learned and true latent factors:** This is a direct measure of how well the model recovers the ground truth shared features.\\n    *   **Disentanglement metrics:** Measures like MIG (Mutual Information Gap) or Beta-VAE metrics might be adapted to assess the separation of shared and private factors.\\n    *   **Reconstruction error:** If the model aims to reconstruct input data from the latent space, reconstruction error can provide indirect evidence of the information captured.\\n    *   **Visualization:** Plotting learned vs. true factors can provide intuitive evidence.\\n*   **Purpose:** The experiments serve to empirically **validate the theoretical propositions**. They demonstrate scenarios where identifiability holds, and crucially, where it breaks down when the necessary conditions are not met (e.g., when private factors are too simple, or when the loss function is not appropriately regularized).\\n\\n## Strengths and Weaknesses of Empirical Results\\n\\n### Strengths:\\n\\n1.  **Clear Validation of Theory:** The experiments excel at demonstrating the theoretical claims. By using controlled synthetic data, the paper rigorously shows *when* identifiability is achieved and *when* it fails, providing strong empirical evidence for the derived conditions.\\n2.  **Illustrative Power:** The simplicity of the experiments makes the results highly interpretable. It's easy to see how the presence or absence of certain conditions (e.g., private variation, noise) directly impacts the identifiability of shared factors.\\n3.  **Foundation for Future Work:** While not achieving SOTA, the empirical results lay a crucial foundation. They provide concrete examples that can inspire the design of more complex experiments and real-world models aimed at satisfying these identifiability conditions.\\n\\n### Weaknesses:\\n\\n1.  **Gap to Real-World Complexity:** The primary weakness is the inherent abstraction from real-world data. Real multimodal data is high-dimensional, highly non-linear, noisy, and often lacks clearly separable ground-truth shared and private factors. The simplified generative models and linear encoders used in experiments might not fully capture these complexities.\\n    *   **Impact:** It's not immediately clear how robust these identifiability conditions are when scaled to deep, non-linear neural networks and massive, diverse datasets (like ImageNet + LAION-5B).\\n2.  **Assumptions Difficult to Verify in Practice:** The theoretical conditions for identifiability often rely on assumptions (e.g., \\\"sufficient private variation,\\\" specific noise structures) that are hard to verify or guarantee in real-world datasets. The experiments demonstrate these conditions but don't offer practical ways to assess them for arbitrary datasets.\\n3.  **Lack of Downstream Task Performance:** The experiments do not typically evaluate performance on downstream tasks (e.g., classification, generation, retrieval accuracy). While not the paper's goal, this means the immediate practical benefit of \\\"identifiable\\\" representations for specific applications remains an open question, although it's generally assumed that truly disentangled and identifiable representations are more useful.\\n4.  **Limited Empirical Guidance on \\\"How Much\\\":** While showing *that* private factors or noise are needed, the experiments might not provide quantitative guidance on *how much* variation or noise is sufficient, or how to practically induce it in complex settings.\\n\\n## Practical Implications and Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\nThe practical implications of this work are significant, albeit often indirect, for guiding the design of more robust MCL systems:\\n\\n1.  **Informed Loss Function Design:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Standard InfoNCE alone might not be sufficient. Explicit terms encouraging disentanglement of shared and private factors could be beneficial. For example, some models include components that learn modality-specific representations in addition to shared ones, or losses that aim to decorrelate shared and private factors.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Develop new contrastive loss variants that explicitly incorporate identifiability constraints, perhaps by penalizing representations that are too similar across modalities *if* they're supposed to capture private information, or by encouraging diversity in private latent spaces.\\n\\n2.  **Principled Data Augmentation Strategies:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Data augmentations play a critical role. Augmentations should ideally *preserve the shared semantic content* while introducing *variations in modality-specific details*. For instance, cropping an image preserves the object (shared) but changes background/perspective (private).\\n    *   **Improvement:** Design augmentation pipelines that are theoretically guided by the identifiability conditions. Actively investigate and quantify how different augmentation strategies affect the identifiability of learned representations on real data, rather than just downstream performance. This might involve creating new benchmarks with known \\\"private\\\" variations.\\n\\n3.  **Architectural Choices:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Architectures could be designed with separate pathways for shared and private representations, or with specific regularization that encourages this separation (e.g., similar to some disentangled representation learning models).\\n    *   **Improvement:** Explore multi-branch architectures where one branch is optimized for shared factors and others for private factors, potentially with a contrastive loss for the shared factors and a reconstruction/regularization loss for the private ones.\\n\\n4.  **Debugging and Diagnosis:**\\n    *   **Implication:** If an MCL model isn't performing as expected, this theory provides a framework for diagnosis. One might ask: Are the identifiability conditions met by the data? Is the model suffering from a lack of private variation, or collapsing representations?\\n    *   **Improvement:** Develop diagnostic tools and metrics based on the theoretical identifiability conditions that can be applied to real-world trained MCL models. For example, can we assess the \\\"private variation\\\" captured by the model or the disentanglement between shared and what *should be* private representations?\\n\\n5.  **Benchmarking and Dataset Creation:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Current benchmarks primarily focus on downstream tasks. To evaluate identifiability, new benchmarks with carefully constructed ground-truth shared and private factors (even if semi-synthetic or highly controlled) would be invaluable.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Propose a new class of multimodal benchmarks designed specifically to test the identifiability of learned representations, possibly by building upon existing datasets with explicit annotations for \\\"private\\\" attributes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \\\"Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning\\\" is a pivotal theoretical work that provides deep insights into the mechanics of MCL. While its empirical evaluation is necessarily simplified, its findings offer a robust framework for understanding, designing, and troubleshooting more effective and truly generalizable multimodal AI systems.

The mathematical rigor is commendable. From a causal inference standpoint, the paper implicitly operates within a specific class of structural causal models (SCMs) and proves identifiability of certain latent variables within these assumed structures. While the causal language isn't always explicit in terms of DAGs or interventions, the underlying generative process is inherently causal.\\n\\n### Causal Framework and Assumptions\\n\\nThe core of the paper's identifiability results relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the data generating process, which can be directly translated into a causal framework:\\n\\n1.  **Generative Model as a Causal Graph:**\\n    The paper posits a generative model where observations $X_1$ and $X_2$ from two modalities are generated from a set of latent variables.\\n    *   **Base Model (Section 3.1):** $X_1 = G_1(Z_c, Z_{sp1})$ and $X_2 = G_2(Z_c, Z_{sp2})$.\\n        *   **Causal Interpretation:** This implicitly assumes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure where:\\n            *   $Z_c$ is a **common cause** of $X_1$ and $X_2$.\\n            *   $Z_{sp1}$ is a **specific cause** of $X_1$.\\n            *   $Z_{sp2}$ is a **specific cause** of $X_2$.\\n            *   There are directed edges $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_1$, $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$, $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow X_1$, and $Z_{sp2} \\\\rightarrow X_2$.\\n            *   The functions $G_1, G_2$ represent the causal mechanisms.\\n    *   **Sequential Causal Model (Section 4):** $X_1 = G_1(Z_c, Z_{sp})$ and $X_2 = G_2(Z_c)$ where $Z_c = G_c(Z_s)$.\\n        *   **Causal Interpretation:** This extends the base model by introducing another layer of latent causality:\\n            *   $Z_s$ is a cause of $Z_c$ ($Z_s \\\\rightarrow Z_c$).\\n            *   $Z_c$ is a common cause of $X_1$ and $X_2$ (or a common factor that influences both, directly $X_2$ and through $Z_{sp}$ for $X_1$). The exact structure for $X_1$ and $X_2$ depends on whether $Z_{sp}$ is a true specific cause or just part of the $X_1$ generation.\\n\\n2.  **Assumption of Exogeneity/Independence of Latent Causes:**\\n    *   **Core Assumption (for base model):** $Z_c, Z_{sp1}, Z_{sp2}$ are assumed to be **mutually independent** (i.e., $Z_c \\\\perp Z_{sp1} \\\\perp Z_{sp2}$).\\n    *   **Causal Justification:** This is a crucial exogeneity assumption. It means there are no unobserved confounders among the latent variables, nor any causal relationships between $Z_c$, $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp2}$. For example, $Z_c$ does not cause $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp1}$ does not cause $Z_{sp2}$. This simplifies the identification problem significantly, as it allows for the disentanglement of their effects.\\n    *   **Clarity and Justification:** This assumption is explicitly stated and forms the cornerstone of their proofs. Its justification lies in the disentanglement learning literature, where such independence assumptions are common to enable identification. However, its real-world validity is often the biggest challenge.\\n\\n3.  **Invertibility/Bijectivity of Generative Functions ($G_i$):**\\n    The identifiability results often rely on the generative functions $G_i$ being (locally) invertible or at least surjective/injective under certain conditions (e.g., \\\"for almost all $z_c$\\\").\\n    *   **Causal Justification:** This relates to the strength of the causal mechanism. If $G_i$ is not sufficiently constrained (e.g., many-to-one mapping), then multiple latent values could produce the same observation, making unique recovery impossible.\\n    *   **Clarity and Justification:** This assumption is clearly stated in the technical conditions for their theorems (e.g., Theorem 3.1, A.2.2). It's a standard requirement in identifiability proofs for latent variable models.\\n\\n4.  **Contrastive Learning as \\\"Intervention-like\\\" Data Collection:**\\n    The contrastive learning framework, which samples positive pairs (same $Z_c$) and negative pairs (different $Z_c$), can be viewed through a causal lens:\\n    *   **Positive Pairs:** Samples $(X_1, X_2)$ derived from the *same* underlying $Z_c$. This implicitly acts like conditioning on or selecting for a specific value of $Z_c$, allowing the model to learn what features *co-vary* when $Z_c$ is held constant (or varying in unison across modalities). This is akin to observing data under a soft \\\"intervention\\\" where $Z_c$ is forced to be identical for the two observed modalities.\\n    *   **Negative Pairs:** Samples $(X_1', X_2'')$ derived from *different* $Z_c$ values. This provides information about what features *do not co-vary* when $Z_c$ is different. This is crucial for distinguishing $Z_c$'s influence from $Z_{sp}$'s.\\n    *   **Clarity:** The paper very clearly describes how the contrastive objective leverages these different pairings. The causal interpretation as an \\\"intervention-like\\\" mechanism is helpful for understanding *why* contrastive learning works for disentanglement.\\n\\n### Modeling Dependencies Between Latent Variables\\n\\nThe paper primarily focuses on the independence of latent variables as a core assumption, meaning there are no causal dependencies *between* $Z_c$, $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp2}$ in their base model.\\n\\n*   **Strict Independence:** This is the default. The model assumes $Z_c$, $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp2}$ are generated from independent sources. This implies no arrows like $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow Z_c$ or $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp2}$.\\n*   **Sequential Causal Model (Section 4):** This is the only explicit deviation from full independence among the \\\"disentangled\\\" latents. Here, $Z_c$ is explicitly modeled as a child of another latent variable $Z_s$ ($Z_s \\\\rightarrow Z_c$). This demonstrates how the framework can be extended to handle a known causal hierarchy among the *common* latent factors.\\n    *   **Feedback:** This model does *not* include feedback loops or cycles, nor does it model dependencies between $Z_c$ and $Z_{sp}$ (e.g., $Z_c \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp}$).\\n    *   **Unobserved Confounding:** The models assume all relevant latent causes ($Z_c, Z_{sp}$) are explicitly modeled. The presence of unobserved confounders *affecting both $Z_c$ and $Z_{sp}$*, or *affecting $X_1$ and $X_2$ independently of $Z_c, Z_{sp}$*, is not considered, which is a common limitation in identifiability.\\n\\n### Potential for Causal Discovery\\n\\nWhile the paper's primary goal is identifiability *given* a specific latent causal structure, it lays a foundation that could be extended towards causal discovery:\\n\\n*   **Discovery of Latent Factors (under assumed structure):** The paper essentially demonstrates the identifiability of *latent causal factors* ($Z_c, Z_{sp1}, Z_{sp2}$) under the strong assumption of their independence and their specific roles (common vs. specific cause). This is a crucial step for causal discovery, as identifying the relevant variables is often the first challenge.\\n*   **Testing Structural Assumptions (Indirectly):** If one were to apply this method to real-world data and find that the *recovered* $Z_c, Z_{sp1}, Z_{sp2}$ are *not* independent (e.g., statistical tests show dependence between the learned representations), this would be strong evidence that the initial assumption of independent latent causes (the underlying causal graph) is incorrect for that dataset. This provides an indirect pathway for structural causal discovery: propose a structure, attempt identifiability, and then test the properties of the identified components.\\n*   **Differentiating Causal Models:** The identifiability analysis for the \\\"sequential causal model\\\" (Section 4) versus the base model suggests that distinct causal structures might lead to different identifiability conditions or recovery properties. This hints at the possibility of distinguishing between different *types* of causal structures (e.g., common cause vs. chain) if one had enough data and specific identification strategies.\\n*   **Limitations for Full Causal Discovery:** The paper does not aim to *discover* the causal graph among arbitrary latent variables from scratch. For instance, it cannot distinguish between $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_1, X_2$ and $X_1 \\\\rightarrow Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$ or more complex latent structures without further assumptions or interventions. It assumes the *form* of the latent causal graph.\\n\\n### Clarity and Justification of Causal Framework\\n\\n*   **Clarity:** The mathematical formulation of the generative model is very clear. The underlying causal structure is implicitly defined by the chosen functional forms and independence assumptions. However, explicit causal language (like DAGs, d-separation, backdoor criterion) is largely absent. While not strictly necessary for their mathematical proofs, incorporating such language would significantly enhance the paper's appeal and clarity for a causal inference audience.\\n*   **Justification:** The core assumption of latent variable independence is justified by its prevalence in disentanglement literature and its necessity for achieving identification under general non-linear settings. The justification for the chosen generative functions (e.g., sufficient expressivity, invertibility conditions) is also clear in the technical appendices.\\n\\n### Suggestions for Alternative Causal Models or Identification Strategies\\n\\n1.  **Relaxing Latent Independence Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Structured Latent Dependencies:** Instead of strict independence, consider models where specific causal relationships *exist* between $Z_c$ and $Z_{sp}$. For example:\\n        *   $Z_c \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp1}$ (e.g., a person's identity $Z_c$ influences their speaking style $Z_{sp1}$).\\n        *   $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp2}$ (e.g., choice of clothing style $Z_{sp1}$ influences accessories $Z_{sp2}$).\\n        *   **Identification Strategy:** This would require more advanced causal disentanglement techniques, potentially leveraging methods from non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or Non-linear Causal Models (NCMs) that can identify sources even when they are dependent, if the causal mechanism is sufficiently constrained (e.g., additive noise models, post-non-linear models).\\n    *   **Identifiability with Confounding:** Introduce unobserved common causes (confounders) that affect multiple latents or observations in ways not captured by $Z_c, Z_{sp}$. This often makes identification impossible without stronger assumptions (e.g., instrumental variables, proxy variables, or specific forms of unobserved confounding).\\n\\n2.  **Explicitly Modeling Noise/Stochasticity:**\\n    *   The current models are largely deterministic functions with a potential for small noise. Explicitly modeling additive or multiplicative noise for the generative process ($X_i = G_i(Z_c, Z_{spi}) + \\\\epsilon_i$) and specifying its properties (e.g., non-Gaussian, independent) could open up pathways for identifiability based on those noise characteristics (as in ANMs).\\n\\n3.  **Leveraging Interventions (Stronger Forms):**\\n    *   While contrastive learning offers a weak form of intervention, truly strong interventions (e.g., explicitly manipulating $Z_c$ and observing $X_1, X_2$; or manipulating $X_1$ and observing $X_2$) would provide much richer causal information. This is often impractical in observational ML, but for specific domains (e.g., robotics, synthetic data generation), it could be applied.\\n    *   **Causal Disentanglement from Interventions:** Referencing works that use explicit interventions to learn causal factors (e.g., \\\"Causal Disentanglement\\\" by Yang et al. or methods using counterfactuals) would strengthen the connection to the broader causal literature.\\n\\n4.  **Beyond Common Cause Models:**\\n    *   Explore identifiability in other fundamental causal structures for multimodal data:\\n        *   **Chain Models:** $X_1 \\\\rightarrow Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$ (or $X_1 \\\\rightarrow X_2$, with $Z_c$ being an intermediate latent variable).\\n        *   **Mediator Models:** $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_1 \\\\rightarrow X_2$.\\n        *   **Collider Models:** $X_1 \\\\leftarrow Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$ (standard common cause), but also $X_1 \\\\rightarrow Z_{latent} \\\\leftarrow X_2$ where $Z_{latent}$ is an unobserved collider. This would be a very different setup but highly relevant for multimodal fusion.\\n\\n5.  **Focus on Identifiability of Causal Effects:**\\n    *   While the paper identifies latent causes, a natural next step for causal inference would be to ask: if we identify these latent factors, can we then identify the *causal effect* of intervening on one latent factor (e.g., $Z_c$) on an observable outcome (e.g., a downstream task involving $X_1$ or $X_2$)? This would bridge representation learning with causal prediction and decision-making.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a robust theoretical foundation for disentanglement in multimodal contrastive learning, grounded in strong, yet interpretable, causal assumptions about the generative process. By more explicitly framing these assumptions within causal inference terminology and exploring relaxations or alternative structures, the work could further contribute to the growing field of causally-aware machine learning.\",\n  \"remaining_resource_budget\": 100,\n  \"remaining_expense_budget\": 9999.86841165\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"title": "Invoking `AskAgent` with \n```json\n{\n  \"agent_name\": \"CausalInferenceAgent\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Please provide a detailed review of the paper 'Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning', focusing on the causal assumptions, the modeling of dependencies between latent variables, and the potential for causal discovery.

This is a highly relevant contribution given the widespread adoption of contrastive learning techniques in multimodal settings.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed review, focusing on the theoretical contributions, proof validity, significance, and areas for improvement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Overall Assessment**\\n\\nThe paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by formally investigating the identifiability of shared latent factors in multimodal contrastive learning. It meticulously establishes conditions under which the learned representations can uniquely recover the ground-truth latent variables. The framework proposed is rigorous, drawing connections to established fields like independent component analysis (ICA) and disentangled representation learning. While the theoretical setup involves some strong assumptions, which are typical for initial identifiability results, the paper provides a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of multimodal contrastive learning.\\n\\n### **1. Theoretical Contributions**\\n\\nThe core theoretical contribution lies in establishing concrete identifiability theorems for multimodal contrastive learning, specifically focusing on the shared latent space.\\n\\n*   **Formal Problem Formulation:** The paper excels at setting up a clear probabilistic generative model for multimodal data, where multiple observed modalities $X_1, \\\\dots, X_M$ are generated from a shared underlying latent variable $Z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^D$ and modality-specific noise $\\\\epsilon_m$. This explicit generative model is crucial for defining what \"identifiability\" means in this context \u2013 i.e., recovering $Z$ or a transformation thereof.\\n\\n*   **Connection to Optimal InfoNCE Solution:** A key theoretical step is linking the InfoNCE loss (or a generalized form of it) to specific statistical properties of the learned embeddings. The paper rigorously demonstrates that at optimality, the learned embeddings $h_m(X_m)$ for different modalities, corresponding to the same latent $Z$, must align, and that the marginal distributions of the embeddings $h_m(X_m)$ across different modalities must match. More profoundly, it investigates how the contrastive objective encourages the learned representations to resemble the underlying shared factors. Often, this involves showing that the optimal encoders effectively \"invert\" the generative process, mapping observations back to the shared latent space.\\n\\n*   **Identifiability Conditions for Shared Latents:**\\n    *   **Linear Case:** The paper likely starts with the most tractable scenario: linear generative models ($X_m = A_m Z + \\\\epsilon_m$) and linear encoders ($g_m(X_m) = W_m X_m$). For this setting, it establishes that the product $W_m A_m$ (the effective transformation from $Z$ to its representation) is identifiable up to a global invertible linear transformation (i.e., $W_m A_m = C \\\\tilde{A}_m$ for all $m$, where $C$ is a global invertible matrix). If $Z$ is assumed to have independent components (akin to ICA), this ambiguity often reduces to a component-wise scaling and permutation. The novelty here is showing how the *multimodal contrastive objective* specifically leads to this form of identifiability, leveraging the cross-modal alignment property.\\n    *   **Non-linear Case:** Moving beyond linearity is a significant challenge. The paper likely explores non-linear identifiability by leveraging assumptions common in disentangled representation learning (e.g., non-linear ICA, specific forms of non-linear mixing, or sufficiency assumptions on individual modalities). This typically requires stronger conditions, such as:\\n        *   **Sufficiently Rich Latent Distribution:** The latent variable $Z$ must be \"rich\" enough (e.g., non-Gaussian, or possessing a specific structure, like discrete categorical variables).\\n        *   **Non-degenerate Mappings:** The true generative functions $G_m$ and the learned encoders $g_m$ must be sufficiently \"expressive\" and non-degenerate (e.g., locally invertible, smooth, or satisfying certain Jacobian rank conditions).\\n        *   **Redundancy/Complementarity of Modalities:** The information content across modalities must be sufficient to uniquely resolve the latent variables. This could be formalized by requiring that the union of information from multiple modalities allows for unique recovery, even if individual modalities are insufficient.\\n\\n*   **Role of Number of Modalities:** A crucial theoretical insight is often the minimum number of modalities ($M \\\\ge 2$) required for identifiability and how increasing $M$ might relax other assumptions (e.g., on the complexity of individual modality encoders or the latent distribution). The paper likely quantifies this by showing that the \"shared signal\" from multiple viewpoints helps resolve ambiguities.\\n\\n*   **Ambiguity Characterization:** Clearly defining the ambiguity class (e.g., up to invertible linear transformations, permutations, or component-wise non-linearities) is a strength. This provides precise bounds on what can and cannot be recovered.\\n\\n### **2. Validity of Proofs and Mathematical Details**\\n\\nBased on typical identifiability literature, the paper\\'s proofs are likely structured logically, proceeding from fundamental definitions to theorem statements and their derivations.\\n\\n*   **Rigor of Assumptions:** The assumptions are the foundation.\\n    *   **Generative Model Assumptions:** Assumptions on the generative process (e.g., $X_m = G_m(Z, \\\\epsilon_m)$) are critical. Are $\\\\epsilon_m$ independent across modalities? Is $Z$ independent? The paper should clearly state these. The *source* of non-linearity (in $G_m$, or in the encoders $g_m$) often dictates the proof complexity.\\n    *   **Assumptions on $Z$:** The independence and non-Gaussianity (or other specific distribution properties like discrete support) of $Z$ components are standard for ICA-like identifiability. The paper must explicitly state if $Z$ is assumed to be unobserved factors (e.g., statistical latents) or if it represents a more concrete semantic concept.\\n    *   **Assumptions on Encoders:** Assumptions on the function class of the encoders $g_m$ (e.g., universal approximators for neural networks, or specific forms like linear/monotonic functions) directly impact the results. Are they assumed to be invertible, or merely surjective on the range of $Z$?\\n    *   **Optimality of InfoNCE:** The proofs likely rely on the assumption that the InfoNCE loss can be perfectly optimized to its global minimum. This is a strong theoretical assumption but necessary for population-level identifiability. The paper should acknowledge this distinction from practical algorithmic identifiability.\\n\\n*   **Proof Structure:**\\n    *   **Population Level Analysis:** Proofs typically start by analyzing the population-level InfoNCE objective (i.e., $\\\\mathbb{E}[L_{InfoNCE}]$). This allows for deriving conditions on the true underlying distributions and mappings.\\n    *   **Derivation Steps:** The derivations usually involve:\\n        *   Showing that optimality implies $h_m(X_m)$ maps to a common space, say $f(Z)$.\\n        *   Using properties of conditional independence induced by the optimal objective.\\n        *   Leveraging characteristic functions, moment generating functions, or specific properties of non-linear transformations (e.g., Theorem 2 of Darmois/Skorokhod for ICA).\\n        *   Applying Jacobian conditions or rank conditions for invertibility/sufficiency.\\n        *   The use of measure-theoretic arguments or functional analysis for continuous, non-linear cases is common and desirable for rigor.\\n\\n*   **Potential Areas for Scrutiny (and suggestions for the paper):**\\n    *   **Exactness vs. Asymptotic:** Is identifiability proven exactly or asymptotically (e.g., with infinite data)? Clarity on this is important.\\n    *   **The \"Identifiability up to an invertible linear transformation\" Lemma/Theorem:** This is a recurring theme. The paper should clearly state the conditions under which this is achieved. For non-linear cases, the transformation might be more complex (e.g., component-wise monotonic), and the proof needs to justify how such non-linearities are resolved.\\n    *   **Technical Lemmas:** Check the precision of any supporting lemmas (e.g., regarding the uniqueness of solutions to certain functional equations or the properties of probability measures under transformation).\\n    *   **Conditions on Jacobians/Hessians:** For non-linear identifiability, conditions on the Jacobian of the generative/encoding functions (e.g., full rank, non-singular almost everywhere) are crucial. Ensure these are explicitly stated and justified.\\n    *   **Measure Theory and Support:** Pay attention to the domains and supports of random variables and functions. Are these clearly defined (e.g., \"almost everywhere,\" \"on the support of $Z$\")?\\n    *   **Non-degenerate Solutions:** Does the proof explicitly rule out trivial or degenerate solutions (e.g., mapping all inputs to a single point)? The InfoNCE loss itself typically prevents this due to the negative samples.\\n    *   **Completeness:** Are all cases covered? E.g., if different assumptions lead to different ambiguity classes, are they all systematically explored?\\n\\n### **3. Significance of Identifiability Results**\\n\\nThe identifiability results in this paper are highly significant, both theoretically and practically:\\n\\n*   **Theoretical Grounding:** It provides a much-needed theoretical underpinning for the empirical success of multimodal contrastive learning. It explains *why* these methods can learn meaningful shared representations, beyond just empirical observation. This moves the field from a heuristic approach to one with formal guarantees.\\n*   **Guiding Model Design:**\\n    *   **Architecture Choices:** The conditions for identifiability can inform architectural design. For instance, if certain forms of non-linearity are unidentifiable, it might suggest using specific activation functions or network structures.\\n    *   **Number of Modalities:** The insights on the minimum number of modalities required for identifiability can guide data collection strategies and model choices in resource-constrained environments.\\n    *   **Loss Function Design:** Understanding what the InfoNCE objective *implies* at optimality can inspire the design of new loss functions that explicitly enforce identifiability-promoting properties.\\n*   **Interpretation and Trust:** If we can prove identifiability, it means the learned representations are not just arbitrary projections but genuinely reflect the underlying factors. This increases trust in the models, especially for downstream tasks like scientific discovery, causal inference, or fairness analyses, where interpretability and reliability are paramount.\\n*   **Connecting to Disentanglement and Causality:** Identifiability of shared factors is a cornerstone of disentangled representation learning and often a prerequisite for causal discovery from observational data. By establishing these results for MCL, the paper bridges these fields and opens avenues for using MCL in more sophisticated causal modeling scenarios.\\n*   **Limitations and Future Work:** The paper\\'s identified conditions also highlight the limitations of current approaches. For example, if strong assumptions (e.g., independence of latent factors, specific non-linearities) are required, it points to areas where future research is needed to relax these assumptions or develop new methods that achieve identifiability under weaker conditions. This could involve exploring weaker forms of identifiability or incorporating additional inductive biases.\\n\\n### **Constructive Feedback on Clarity and Rigor**\\n\\n*   **Clear Roadmap:** The paper should ideally start with a high-level roadmap of its theoretical contributions, making it easy for the reader to follow the progression from simpler to more complex identifiability scenarios.\\n*   **Precise Notation:** Ensure all mathematical notation is introduced clearly and consistently. For instance, clearly distinguish between population-level expectations and empirical approximations, true generative functions and learned encoders, and latent variables vs. their representations.\\n*   **Assumptions Section:** A dedicated section (or prominent subsection) for \"Assumptions\" is crucial. Each assumption should be stated formally, followed by a brief intuitive explanation and, if possible, a discussion of its implications or known relaxations from the literature. This helps readers quickly grasp the scope of the results.\\n*   **Theorem/Proof Structure:** Each theorem should be clearly stated, followed immediately by its proof. If proofs are lengthy, consider outlining the key steps or providing an intuitive sketch before the formal proof. Referencing relevant background theorems from ICA, disentanglement, or probability theory (e.g., Darmois-Skorokhod, specific forms of characteristic functions) with proper citations is essential.\\n*   **Discussion of Ambiguity:** Explicitly discuss the \"ambiguity class\" for each identifiability result. What exactly is identifiable, and what transformations are still permissible?\\n*   **Practical Implications and Limitations:** While theoretical, a brief section discussing the practical implications of the results (e.g., \"This implies we should prefer models that...\") and the limitations imposed by the assumptions (e.g., \"These results hold under independent latents; future work will explore correlated latents\") would be highly beneficial for a broader audience.\\n*   **Examples/Illustrations (Optional but helpful):** While theoretical, a simple synthetic example (e.g., a 2D linear case with visualizations) could significantly aid understanding, especially for illustrating the ambiguity classes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn summary, \"Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning\" is a vital theoretical contribution that brings much-needed rigor to the field. By carefully delineating the conditions for identifiability, the paper not only explains why current methods work but also provides a robust framework for designing more principled and reliable multimodal representation learning systems in the future.

Unlike many works in multimodal learning that propose new architectures or achieve state-of-the-art empirical results, this research focuses on the **identifiability** of shared latent representations in MCL. Identifiability, in this context, means that the learned representations correspond uniquely to the true underlying generative factors that are common across modalities, up to some trivial transformations (e.g., scaling or permutation).\\n\\nThe core thesis is that standard MCL objectives, like InfoNCE, do not *inherently* guarantee identifiability of shared factors without additional assumptions or inductive biases. The paper formalizes the conditions under which shared representations *can* be identified, often hinging on the existence and proper handling of modality-specific (private) factors and noise.\\n\\n## Relevance to the Multimodal Learning Community\\n\\nThe relevance of this work is exceptionally high and foundational for several reasons:\\n\\n1.  **Fundamental Understanding:** It moves beyond empirical success to provide a theoretical underpinning for *why* MCL works when it does. This understanding is crucial for the principled design of future MCL models. Without identifiability, we might be training models that perform well on specific benchmarks but fail to capture the true semantic relationships, leading to brittleness and lack of generalization.\\n2.  **Explaining Successes and Failures:** The theory offers insights into why models like CLIP succeed (implicitly satisfying some identifiability conditions, e.g., via rich text and image data, and specific data augmentation strategies) and why simpler MCL setups might sometimes learn trivial or degenerate solutions (e.g., collapsing representations or focusing on modality-specific features).\\n3.  **Guiding Principled Design:** By identifying the conditions for identifiability (e.g., sufficient \"private variation\" within each modality, or effective disentanglement strategies), the paper provides actionable guidance for designing more robust loss functions, architectural choices, and data augmentation strategies.\\n4.  **Beyond Retrieval:** While MCL is often used for cross-modal retrieval, its ultimate goal is often a deeper understanding of multimodal data. Identifiable shared representations are a necessary step towards robust multimodal reasoning, generation, and transfer learning, as they ensure the model truly grasps the common semantic content.\\n5.  **Long-Term Impact:** This work can be considered seminal in guiding the theoretical development of multimodal representation learning, similar to how identifiability results have impacted disentangled representation learning in unimodal settings. It shifts the conversation from \"what works\" to \"why it works\" and \"when it works reliably.\"\\n\\n## Experimental Setup\\n\\nGiven the theoretical nature of the paper, the experimental setup is primarily **illustrative** rather than competitive.\\n\\n*   **Datasets:** The experiments typically rely on **synthetic data** where the ground-truth shared and private factors are explicitly known and controllable. This is a crucial design choice because identifiability can only be verified if the true underlying generative process is known. Examples might include:\\n    *   Simple linear generative models (e.g., Gaussian latent variables, linear mapping to observed data).\\n    *   Controlled non-linear synthetic datasets with distinct shared and private components.\\n    *   (Less common for core identifiability proofs, but might be used for practical demonstration) Very simplified real-world datasets where certain aspects can be manually controlled or assumed.\\n*   **Models:** The models used are generally **simplified encoders** (e.g., linear mappings, simple MLPs) rather than complex deep neural networks. This choice allows the researchers to isolate the identifiability problem from the complexities of high-dimensional non-linear representation learning and optimize for clarity in demonstrating the theoretical findings.\\n*   **Metrics:** Standard performance metrics like accuracy or retrieval scores are often secondary. The primary metrics focus on directly evaluating identifiability:\\n    *   **Correlation between learned and true latent factors:** This is a direct measure of how well the model recovers the ground truth shared features.\\n    *   **Disentanglement metrics:** Measures like MIG (Mutual Information Gap) or Beta-VAE metrics might be adapted to assess the separation of shared and private factors.\\n    *   **Reconstruction error:** If the model aims to reconstruct input data from the latent space, reconstruction error can provide indirect evidence of the information captured.\\n    *   **Visualization:** Plotting learned vs. true factors can provide intuitive evidence.\\n*   **Purpose:** The experiments serve to empirically **validate the theoretical propositions**. They demonstrate scenarios where identifiability holds, and crucially, where it breaks down when the necessary conditions are not met (e.g., when private factors are too simple, or when the loss function is not appropriately regularized).\\n\\n## Strengths and Weaknesses of Empirical Results\\n\\n### Strengths:\\n\\n1.  **Clear Validation of Theory:** The experiments excel at demonstrating the theoretical claims. By using controlled synthetic data, the paper rigorously shows *when* identifiability is achieved and *when* it fails, providing strong empirical evidence for the derived conditions.\\n2.  **Illustrative Power:** The simplicity of the experiments makes the results highly interpretable. It\\'s easy to see how the presence or absence of certain conditions (e.g., private variation, noise) directly impacts the identifiability of shared factors.\\n3.  **Foundation for Future Work:** While not achieving SOTA, the empirical results lay a crucial foundation. They provide concrete examples that can inspire the design of more complex experiments and real-world models aimed at satisfying these identifiability conditions.\\n\\n### Weaknesses:\\n\\n1.  **Gap to Real-World Complexity:** The primary weakness is the inherent abstraction from real-world data. Real multimodal data is high-dimensional, highly non-linear, noisy, and often lacks clearly separable ground-truth shared and private factors. The simplified generative models and linear encoders used in experiments might not fully capture these complexities.\\n    *   **Impact:** It\\'s not immediately clear how robust these identifiability conditions are when scaled to deep, non-linear neural networks and massive, diverse datasets (like ImageNet + LAION-5B).\\n2.  **Assumptions Difficult to Verify in Practice:** The theoretical conditions for identifiability often rely on assumptions (e.g., \"sufficient private variation,\" specific noise structures) that are hard to verify or guarantee in real-world datasets. The experiments demonstrate these conditions but don\\'t offer practical ways to assess them for arbitrary datasets.\\n3.  **Lack of Downstream Task Performance:** The experiments do not typically evaluate performance on downstream tasks (e.g., classification, generation, retrieval accuracy). While not the paper\\'s goal, this means the immediate practical benefit of \"identifiable\" representations for specific applications remains an open question, although it\\'s generally assumed that truly disentangled and identifiable representations are more useful.\\n4.  **Limited Empirical Guidance on \"How Much\":** While showing *that* private factors or noise are needed, the experiments might not provide quantitative guidance on *how much* variation or noise is sufficient, or how to practically induce it in complex settings.\\n\\n## Practical Implications and Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\nThe practical implications of this work are significant, albeit often indirect, for guiding the design of more robust MCL systems:\\n\\n1.  **Informed Loss Function Design:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Standard InfoNCE alone might not be sufficient. Explicit terms encouraging disentanglement of shared and private factors could be beneficial. For example, some models include components that learn modality-specific representations in addition to shared ones, or losses that aim to decorrelate shared and private factors.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Develop new contrastive loss variants that explicitly incorporate identifiability constraints, perhaps by penalizing representations that are too similar across modalities *if* they\\'re supposed to capture private information, or by encouraging diversity in private latent spaces.\\n\\n2.  **Principled Data Augmentation Strategies:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Data augmentations play a critical role. Augmentations should ideally *preserve the shared semantic content* while introducing *variations in modality-specific details*. For instance, cropping an image preserves the object (shared) but changes background/perspective (private).\\n    *   **Improvement:** Design augmentation pipelines that are theoretically guided by the identifiability conditions. Actively investigate and quantify how different augmentation strategies affect the identifiability of learned representations on real data, rather than just downstream performance. This might involve creating new benchmarks with known \"private\" variations.\\n\\n3.  **Architectural Choices:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Architectures could be designed with separate pathways for shared and private representations, or with specific regularization that encourages this separation (e.g., similar to some disentangled representation learning models).\\n    *   **Improvement:** Explore multi-branch architectures where one branch is optimized for shared factors and others for private factors, potentially with a contrastive loss for the shared factors and a reconstruction/regularization loss for the private ones.\\n\\n4.  **Debugging and Diagnosis:**\\n    *   **Implication:** If an MCL model isn\\'t performing as expected, this theory provides a framework for diagnosis. One might ask: Are the identifiability conditions met by the data? Is the model suffering from a lack of private variation, or collapsing representations?\\n    *   **Improvement:** Develop diagnostic tools and metrics based on the theoretical identifiability conditions that can be applied to real-world trained MCL models. For example, can we assess the \"private variation\" captured by the model or the disentanglement between shared and what *should be* private representations?\\n\\n5.  **Benchmarking and Dataset Creation:**\\n    *   **Implication:** Current benchmarks primarily focus on downstream tasks. To evaluate identifiability, new benchmarks with carefully constructed ground-truth shared and private factors (even if semi-synthetic or highly controlled) would be invaluable.\\n    *   **Improvement:** Propose a new class of multimodal benchmarks designed specifically to test the identifiability of learned representations, possibly by building upon existing datasets with explicit annotations for \"private\" attributes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \"Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning\" is a pivotal theoretical work that provides deep insights into the mechanics of MCL. While its empirical evaluation is necessarily simplified, its findings offer a robust framework for understanding, designing, and troubleshooting more effective and truly generalizable multimodal AI systems.

The mathematical rigor is commendable. From a causal inference standpoint, the paper implicitly operates within a specific class of structural causal models (SCMs) and proves identifiability of certain latent variables within these assumed structures. While the causal language isn\\'t always explicit in terms of DAGs or interventions, the underlying generative process is inherently causal.\\n\\n### Causal Framework and Assumptions\\n\\nThe core of the paper\\'s identifiability results relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the data generating process, which can be directly translated into a causal framework:\\n\\n1.  **Generative Model as a Causal Graph:**\\n    The paper posits a generative model where observations $X_1$ and $X_2$ from two modalities are generated from a set of latent variables.\\n    *   **Base Model (Section 3.1):** $X_1 = G_1(Z_c, Z_{sp1})$ and $X_2 = G_2(Z_c, Z_{sp2})$.\\n        *   **Causal Interpretation:** This implicitly assumes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure where:\\n            *   $Z_c$ is a **common cause** of $X_1$ and $X_2$.\\n            *   $Z_{sp1}$ is a **specific cause** of $X_1$.\\n            *   $Z_{sp2}$ is a **specific cause** of $X_2$.\\n            *   There are directed edges $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_1$, $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$, $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow X_1$, and $Z_{sp2} \\\\rightarrow X_2$.\\n            *   The functions $G_1, G_2$ represent the causal mechanisms.\\n    *   **Sequential Causal Model (Section 4):** $X_1 = G_1(Z_c, Z_{sp})$ and $X_2 = G_2(Z_c)$ where $Z_c = G_c(Z_s)$.\\n        *   **Causal Interpretation:** This extends the base model by introducing another layer of latent causality:\\n            *   $Z_s$ is a cause of $Z_c$ ($Z_s \\\\rightarrow Z_c$).\\n            *   $Z_c$ is a common cause of $X_1$ and $X_2$ (or a common factor that influences both, directly $X_2$ and through $Z_{sp}$ for $X_1$). The exact structure for $X_1$ and $X_2$ depends on whether $Z_{sp}$ is a true specific cause or just part of the $X_1$ generation.\\n\\n2.  **Assumption of Exogeneity/Independence of Latent Causes:**\\n    *   **Core Assumption (for base model):** $Z_c, Z_{sp1}, Z_{sp2}$ are assumed to be **mutually independent** (i.e., $Z_c \\\\perp Z_{sp1} \\\\perp Z_{sp2}$).\\n    *   **Causal Justification:** This is a crucial exogeneity assumption. It means there are no unobserved confounders among the latent variables, nor any causal relationships between $Z_c$, $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp2}$. For example, $Z_c$ does not cause $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp1}$ does not cause $Z_{sp2}$. This simplifies the identification problem significantly, as it allows for the disentanglement of their effects.\\n    *   **Clarity and Justification:** This assumption is explicitly stated and forms the cornerstone of their proofs. Its justification lies in the disentanglement learning literature, where such independence assumptions are common to enable identification. However, its real-world validity is often the biggest challenge.\\n\\n3.  **Invertibility/Bijectivity of Generative Functions ($G_i$):**\\n    The identifiability results often rely on the generative functions $G_i$ being (locally) invertible or at least surjective/injective under certain conditions (e.g., \"for almost all $z_c$\").\\n    *   **Causal Justification:** This relates to the strength of the causal mechanism. If $G_i$ is not sufficiently constrained (e.g., many-to-one mapping), then multiple latent values could produce the same observation, making unique recovery impossible.\\n    *   **Clarity and Justification:** This assumption is clearly stated in the technical conditions for their theorems (e.g., Theorem 3.1, A.2.2). It\\'s a standard requirement in identifiability proofs for latent variable models.\\n\\n4.  **Contrastive Learning as \"Intervention-like\" Data Collection:**\\n    The contrastive learning framework, which samples positive pairs (same $Z_c$) and negative pairs (different $Z_c$), can be viewed through a causal lens:\\n    *   **Positive Pairs:** Samples $(X_1, X_2)$ derived from the *same* underlying $Z_c$. This implicitly acts like conditioning on or selecting for a specific value of $Z_c$, allowing the model to learn what features *co-vary* when $Z_c$ is held constant (or varying in unison across modalities). This is akin to observing data under a soft \"intervention\" where $Z_c$ is forced to be identical for the two observed modalities.\\n    *   **Negative Pairs:** Samples $(X_1\\', X_2\\'\\')$ derived from *different* $Z_c$ values. This provides information about what features *do not co-vary* when $Z_c$ is different. This is crucial for distinguishing $Z_c$\\'s influence from $Z_{sp}$\\'s.\\n    *   **Clarity:** The paper very clearly describes how the contrastive objective leverages these different pairings. The causal interpretation as an \"intervention-like\" mechanism is helpful for understanding *why* contrastive learning works for disentanglement.\\n\\n### Modeling Dependencies Between Latent Variables\\n\\nThe paper primarily focuses on the independence of latent variables as a core assumption, meaning there are no causal dependencies *between* $Z_c$, $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp2}$ in their base model.\\n\\n*   **Strict Independence:** This is the default. The model assumes $Z_c$, $Z_{sp1}$, and $Z_{sp2}$ are generated from independent sources. This implies no arrows like $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow Z_c$ or $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp2}$.\\n*   **Sequential Causal Model (Section 4):** This is the only explicit deviation from full independence among the \"disentangled\" latents. Here, $Z_c$ is explicitly modeled as a child of another latent variable $Z_s$ ($Z_s \\\\rightarrow Z_c$). This demonstrates how the framework can be extended to handle a known causal hierarchy among the *common* latent factors.\\n    *   **Feedback:** This model does *not* include feedback loops or cycles, nor does it model dependencies between $Z_c$ and $Z_{sp}$ (e.g., $Z_c \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp}$).\\n    *   **Unobserved Confounding:** The models assume all relevant latent causes ($Z_c, Z_{sp}$) are explicitly modeled. The presence of unobserved confounders *affecting both $Z_c$ and $Z_{sp}$*, or *affecting $X_1$ and $X_2$ independently of $Z_c, Z_{sp}$*, is not considered, which is a common limitation in identifiability.\\n\\n### Potential for Causal Discovery\\n\\nWhile the paper\\'s primary goal is identifiability *given* a specific latent causal structure, it lays a foundation that could be extended towards causal discovery:\\n\\n*   **Discovery of Latent Factors (under assumed structure):** The paper essentially demonstrates the identifiability of *latent causal factors* ($Z_c, Z_{sp1}, Z_{sp2}$) under the strong assumption of their independence and their specific roles (common vs. specific cause). This is a crucial step for causal discovery, as identifying the relevant variables is often the first challenge.\\n*   **Testing Structural Assumptions (Indirectly):** If one were to apply this method to real-world data and find that the *recovered* $Z_c, Z_{sp1}, Z_{sp2}$ are *not* independent (e.g., statistical tests show dependence between the learned representations), this would be strong evidence that the initial assumption of independent latent causes (the underlying causal graph) is incorrect for that dataset. This provides an indirect pathway for structural causal discovery: propose a structure, attempt identifiability, and then test the properties of the identified components.\\n*   **Differentiating Causal Models:** The identifiability analysis for the \"sequential causal model\" (Section 4) versus the base model suggests that distinct causal structures might lead to different identifiability conditions or recovery properties. This hints at the possibility of distinguishing between different *types* of causal structures (e.g., common cause vs. chain) if one had enough data and specific identification strategies.\\n*   **Limitations for Full Causal Discovery:** The paper does not aim to *discover* the causal graph among arbitrary latent variables from scratch. For instance, it cannot distinguish between $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_1, X_2$ and $X_1 \\\\rightarrow Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$ or more complex latent structures without further assumptions or interventions. It assumes the *form* of the latent causal graph.\\n\\n### Clarity and Justification of Causal Framework\\n\\n*   **Clarity:** The mathematical formulation of the generative model is very clear. The underlying causal structure is implicitly defined by the chosen functional forms and independence assumptions. However, explicit causal language (like DAGs, d-separation, backdoor criterion) is largely absent. While not strictly necessary for their mathematical proofs, incorporating such language would significantly enhance the paper\\'s appeal and clarity for a causal inference audience.\\n*   **Justification:** The core assumption of latent variable independence is justified by its prevalence in disentanglement literature and its necessity for achieving identification under general non-linear settings. The justification for the chosen generative functions (e.g., sufficient expressivity, invertibility conditions) is also clear in the technical appendices.\\n\\n### Suggestions for Alternative Causal Models or Identification Strategies\\n\\n1.  **Relaxing Latent Independence Assumptions:**\\n    *   **Structured Latent Dependencies:** Instead of strict independence, consider models where specific causal relationships *exist* between $Z_c$ and $Z_{sp}$. For example:\\n        *   $Z_c \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp1}$ (e.g., a person\\'s identity $Z_c$ influences their speaking style $Z_{sp1}$).\\n        *   $Z_{sp1} \\\\rightarrow Z_{sp2}$ (e.g., choice of clothing style $Z_{sp1}$ influences accessories $Z_{sp2}$).\\n        *   **Identification Strategy:** This would require more advanced causal disentanglement techniques, potentially leveraging methods from non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or Non-linear Causal Models (NCMs) that can identify sources even when they are dependent, if the causal mechanism is sufficiently constrained (e.g., additive noise models, post-non-linear models).\\n    *   **Identifiability with Confounding:** Introduce unobserved common causes (confounders) that affect multiple latents or observations in ways not captured by $Z_c, Z_{sp}$. This often makes identification impossible without stronger assumptions (e.g., instrumental variables, proxy variables, or specific forms of unobserved confounding).\\n\\n2.  **Explicitly Modeling Noise/Stochasticity:**\\n    *   The current models are largely deterministic functions with a potential for small noise. Explicitly modeling additive or multiplicative noise for the generative process ($X_i = G_i(Z_c, Z_{spi}) + \\\\epsilon_i$) and specifying its properties (e.g., non-Gaussian, independent) could open up pathways for identifiability based on those noise characteristics (as in ANMs).\\n\\n3.  **Leveraging Interventions (Stronger Forms):**\\n    *   While contrastive learning offers a weak form of intervention, truly strong interventions (e.g., explicitly manipulating $Z_c$ and observing $X_1, X_2$; or manipulating $X_1$ and observing $X_2$) would provide much richer causal information. This is often impractical in observational ML, but for specific domains (e.g., robotics, synthetic data generation), it could be applied.\\n    *   **Causal Disentanglement from Interventions:** Referencing works that use explicit interventions to learn causal factors (e.g., \"Causal Disentanglement\" by Yang et al. or methods using counterfactuals) would strengthen the connection to the broader causal literature.\\n\\n4.  **Beyond Common Cause Models:**\\n    *   Explore identifiability in other fundamental causal structures for multimodal data:\\n        *   **Chain Models:** $X_1 \\\\rightarrow Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$ (or $X_1 \\\\rightarrow X_2$, with $Z_c$ being an intermediate latent variable).\\n        *   **Mediator Models:** $Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_1 \\\\rightarrow X_2$.\\n        *   **Collider Models:** $X_1 \\\\leftarrow Z_c \\\\rightarrow X_2$ (standard common cause), but also $X_1 \\\\rightarrow Z_{latent} \\\\leftarrow X_2$ where $Z_{latent}$ is an unobserved collider. This would be a very different setup but highly relevant for multimodal fusion.\\n\\n5.  **Focus on Identifiability of Causal Effects:**\\n    *   While the paper identifies latent causes, a natural next step for causal inference would be to ask: if we identify these latent factors, can we then identify the *causal effect* of intervening on one latent factor (e.g., $Z_c$) on an observable outcome (e.g., a downstream task involving $X_1$ or $X_2$)? This would bridge representation learning with causal prediction and decision-making.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a robust theoretical foundation for disentanglement in multimodal contrastive learning, grounded in strong, yet interpretable, causal assumptions about the generative process. By more explicitly framing these assumptions within causal inference terminology and exploring relaxations or alternative structures, the work could further contribute to the growing field of causally-aware machine learning.', 'remaining_resource_budget': 100, 'remaining_expense_budget': 9999.86841165}}), inline_data=None, text=None)], role='tool')"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Step 5: Collaborative Review Discussion and Consensus Building**\n\nThe three agents have provided detailed reviews.
