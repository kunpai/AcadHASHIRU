**Abstract:**  
Multiple pathologic conditions can lead to a diseased and symptomatic glenohumeral joint for which total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) replacement may be indicated. The long-term survival of implants is limited. With the increasing incidence of joint replacement surgery, it can be anticipated that joint replacement revision surgery will become more common. It can be challenging at times to retrieve the manufacturer of the in situ implant. Therefore, certain systems facilitated by AI techniques such as deep learning (DL) can help correctly identify the implanted prosthesis. Correct identification of implants in revision surgery can help reduce perioperative complications and complications. DL was used in this study to categorise different implants based on X-ray images into four classes (as a first case study of the small dataset): Cofield, Depuy, Tornier, and Zimmer. Imbalanced and small public datasets for shoulder implants can lead to poor performance of DL model training. Most of the methods in the literature have adopted the idea of transfer learning (TL) from ImageNet models. This type of TL has been proven ineffective due to some concerns regarding the contrast between features learnt from natural images (ImageNet: colour images) and shoulder implants in X-ray images (greyscale images). To address that, a new TL approach (self-supervised pertaining (SSP)) is proposed to resolve the issue of small datasets. The SSP approach is based on training the DL models (ImageNet models) on a large number of unlabelled greyscale medical images in the domain to update the features. The models are then trained on a small labelled data set of X-ray images of shoulder implants. The SSP shows excellent results in five ImageNet models, including MobilNetV2, DarkNet19, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNet with precision of 96.69%, 95.45%, 98.76%, 98.35%, and 96.6%, respectively. Furthermore, it has been shown that different domains of TL (such as ImageNet) do not significantly affect the performance of shoulder implants in X-ray images. A lightweight model trained from scratch achieves 96.6% accuracy, which is similar to using standard ImageNet models. The features extracted by the DL models are used to train several ML classifiers that show outstanding performance by obtaining an accuracy of 99.20% with Xception+SVM. Finally, extended experimentation has been carried out to elucidate our approach’s real effectiveness in dealing with different medical imaging scenarios. Specifically, five different datasets are trained and tested with and without the proposed SSP, including the shoulder X-ray with an accuracy of 99.47% and CT brain stroke with an accuracy of 98.60%.

**Abstract:**  
—Now-a-days, artificial prosthesis is widely used to mitigate pain in damaged shoulders and restore their movement ability. The process involves a complex surgery that attempts to fix an artificial prosthesis into a dead shoulder as a replacement for the ball and socket joints of the shoulder. Long after the surgical process, the need for revision or reoperation may arise due to some problems with the prosthesis. Identification of prosthesis manufacturer is a paramount step in the reoperation exercise. Traditional approach compares the prosthesis under consideration with prosthesis from a vast number of manufacturers. This approach is cost-efficient and requires no extra training for the physician to identify the prosthesis manufacturer. However, the method is time inefficient and is prone to mistakes. Systems based on machine learning have the potential to reduce human errors and expedite the revision process. This paper proposes a shallow 2D convolution neural network (CNN) for the classification of shoulder prosthesis To speed-up the learning process and improve the performance of the deep learning model for implant classification, this paper employed three different techniques. Firstly, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is applied to the dataset to augment the classes with fewer samples to ensure the data imbalance problem is eliminated. Secondly, the highly discriminating features are extracted using principal component analysis (PCA) and used to train the proposed model. Lastly, the model hyper-parameters are optimised to ensure optimal model performance. The model trained with extracted features with a variance of 0.99 achieved the best accuracy of 99.8%.

**Abstract:**  
Aims: This study aimed to investigate the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning approach to accurately identify total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants from X-ray radiographs. 
Methods: This retrospective study employed a deep learning CNN system to analyze pre-revision and post-operative knee X-rays from TKA patients. We excluded cases involving unicondylar and revision knee replacements, as well as low-quality or unavailable X-ray images and those with other implants. Ten cruciate-retaining TKA replacement models were assessed from various manufacturers. The training set comprised 69% of the data, with the remaining 31% in the test set, augmented due to limited images. Evaluation metrics included accuracy and F1 score, and we developed the software in Python using the TensorFlow library for the CNN method. A computer scientist with AI expertise managed data processing and testing, calculating specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy to assess CNN performance. 
Results: In this study, a total of 282 AP and lateral X-rays from 141 patients were examined, encompassing 10 distinct knee prosthesis models from various manufacturers, each with varying X-ray counts. The CNN technique exhibited flawless accuracy, achieving a 100% identification rate for both the manufacturer and model of TKA across all 10 different models. Furthermore, the CNN method demonstrated exceptional specificity and sensitivity, consistently reaching 100% for each individual implant model. 
Conclusion: This study underscores the impressive capacity of deep learning AI algorithms to precisely identify knee arthroplasty implants from X-ray radiographs. It highlights AI’s ability to detect subtle changes imperceptible to humans, execute precise computations, and handle extensive data. The accurate recognition of knee replacement implants using AI algorithms prior to revision surgeries promises to enhance procedure efficiency and outcomes.

### Assessing Vision Quality in Retinal Prosthesis Implantees through Deep Learning: Current Progress and Improvements by Optimizing Hardware Design Parameters and Rehabilitation

**Abstract:**  
Retinal prosthesis (RP) is used to partially restore vision in patients with degenerative retinal diseases. Assessing the quality of RP-acquired (i.e., prosthetic) vision is needed to evaluate RP impact and prospects. Spatial distortions caused by electrical stimulation of the retina in RP, and the low number of electrodes, have limited the prosthetic vision: patients mostly localize shapes and shadows rather than recognizing objects. We simulate prosthetic vision and evaluate vision on image classification tasks, varying critical hardware parameters: total number and size of electrodes. We also simulate rehabilitation by re-training our models on prosthetic vision images. We find that electrode size has little impact on vision while at least 400 electrodes are needed to sufficiently restore vision (more than 65% classification accuracy on a complex visual task after rehabilitation). Argus II, a currently available implant, produces a low-resolution vision leading to low accuracy (21.3% score after rehabilitation) in complex vision tasks. Rehabilitation produces significant improvements (accuracy improvement of up to 30% on complex tasks, depending on the number of electrodes) in the attained vision, boosting our expectations for RP interventions and motivating the establishment of rehabilitation procedures for RP implantees.

**Abstract:**  
Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) is the process of replacing the damaged ball and socket joint in the shoulder with a prosthesis made with polyethylene and metal components. After this procedure, intervention may be required as a result of damage to the prosthesis, except for the need for an examination regarding the prosthesis at certain periods. If the patient does not have information about the model and manufacturer of the prosthesis, the treatment process is delayed. Artificial intelligence-assisted systems can speed up the treatment process by classifying the manufacturer and model of the prosthesis. In this study, artificial intelligence methods were applied to classify shoulder implants using X-ray images. The model and manufacturer of the prosthesis is detected by using the proposed deep learning method. Besides, the most commonly used machine learning classifiers were applied for the same problem to compare the results and show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the accuracy and precision analysis and measurements of the processing times for the applied methods were performed to reveal the performance, accuracy, and efficiency of the study. In order to measure the performance of the proposed method, it was compared with studies on the same problem in the literature. As a result of the comparison, it was found that the proposed method, with an accuracy rate of 97.2%, performed better than the other studies. In the study, the implant manufacturer and model are classified in order to carry out the implant surgery process in the best way with the proposed deep learning model. With the success of the proposed system, the applicability of this model in similar prosthesis classifications has been shown. Differently from the studies in the literature, the channel selection formula is presented in the proposed deep learning method recommended for selecting the most distinctive feature filters.
